Project Overview
MNsure is seeking a vendor to develop and implement a comprehensive Compliance Plan and sustainable
supporting Compliance Program for the organization.


Background
Starting in 2011, Minnesota began designing, developing and implementing the various technology
components necessary for a state-based health benefit marketplace as defined under the federal Affordable
Care Act. On October 1, 2013, the MNsure application went “live” to the public to facilitate the comparison,
choice, and purchase of health care coverage for individuals and employees of small businesses. Utilizing this
application, individuals and employees have access to comparable information on costs, benefits, and health
care providers for an array of coverage options. This information is used to select and enroll in the health
benefit plan best meeting an enrollee’s personal and family needs. Eligible individuals and small businesses
can also receive premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions or help individuals enroll in Federal or State
health care programs. By engaging consumers in a one-stop shopping experience with transparent
information, MNsure makes purchasing health insurance easier and more understandable, puts more control
and choice in the hands of individuals and employees of small businesses, and promotes greater market
competition.

Concurrent with the development and deployment of the technology platform for the marketplace, MNsure has
commenced creating business processes to support the market place. Currently there are approximately 200
employees engaged in functional areas such as eligibility and enrollment, operations, finance, plan
management, legal and compliance, and SHOP. As the various functional areas have taken shape, MNsure
has continued to develop infrastructure to support these areas. This has included the publication of an
organizational chart, policies and procedures, and the development of training modules.


Goal
To develop and implement a comprehensive Compliance Program for MNsure based upon public and private
sector best practices and stakeholder input.

Responder must provide a list of all entities with which it has relationships that create, or appear to create, a
conflict of interest with the work that is contemplated in this request for proposals. The list must identify the
name of the entity, the relationship, and a discussion of the conflict.

MNsure RFP_ Compliance Program Vendor_5/9/2014
Disposition of Responses
All materials submitted in response to this RFP will become property of MNsure and will become public record
in accordance with Minnesota Statute § 13.591, after the evaluation process is completed. Pursuant to the
statute, completion of the evaluation process occurs when the government entity has completed negotiating
the contract with the selected vendor. If the Responder submits information in response to this RFP that it
believes to be trade secret materials as defined by the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, Minnesota
Statute § 13.37, the Responder must:
    • clearly mark all trade secret materials in its response at the time the Proposal is submitted;
    • include a statement with its response justifying the trade secret designation for each item; and
    • defend any action seeking release of the materials it believes to be trade secret, and indemnify and
        hold harmless the State, its agents and employees, from any judgments or damages awarded against
        the State in favor of the party requesting the materials, and any and all costs connected with that
        defense. This indemnification survives MNsure’s award of a contract. In submitting a response to this
        RFP, the Responder agrees that this indemnification survives as long as the trade secret materials are
        in possession of MNsure.

MNsure does not consider the prices submitted by the Responder to be proprietary or trade secret materials.

Contingency Fees Prohibited
Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes § 10A.06, no person may act as or employ a lobbyist for compensation that is
dependent upon the result or outcome of any legislation or administrative action.

Sample MNsure Contract (Attachment 6)
Responders should be aware of MNsure’s standard contract terms and conditions in preparing their response
and a sample MNsure Professional/Technical Services Contract is attached for reference.
If you take exception to any of the terms, conditions or language in the contract, and are requesting
modifications to the sample contract included in Attachment 6, you must indicate those exceptions by including
a “redlined” version of the sample contract with your response to the RFP that specifically identifies the
exceptions/modifications you are seeking.

Organizational Conflict of Interest
The responder warrants that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise disclosed, there
are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to organizational conflicts of interest. An
organizational conflict of interest exists when, because of existing or planned activities or because of
relationships with other persons, a vendor is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or
advice to MNsure, or the vendor’s objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired,
or the vendor has an unfair competitive advantage. The responder agrees that, if after award, an organizational
conflict of interest is discovered, an immediate and full disclosure in writing must be made to MNsure’s Chief
Procurement Officer which must include a description of the action which the contractor has taken or proposes
to take to avoid or mitigate such conflicts. If an organizational conflict of interest is determined to exist, MNsure
may, at its discretion, cancel the contract. In the event the responder was aware of an organizational conflict of
interest prior to the award of the contract and did not disclose the conflict to MNsure, MNsure may terminate
the contract for default. The provisions of this clause must be included in all subcontracts for work to be
performed similar to the service provided by the prime contractor, and the terms “contract,” “contractor,” and
“contracting officer” modified appropriately to preserve MNsure’s rights.

government as a condition of receiving federal funds, the commissioner shall award up to a six percent (6%)
preference on state procurement to certified small businesses that are majority-owned and operated by:

    4. Professional/Technical, Errors and Omissions, and/or Miscellaneous Liability Insurance. This
       policy will provide coverage for all claims the contractor may become legally obligated to pay resulting
       from any actual or alleged negligent act, error, or omission related to Contractor’s professional services
       required under the contract. Contractor is required to carry the following minimum limits:

            $2,000,000 – per claim or event
            $2,000,000 – annual aggregate

        Any deductible will be the sole responsibility of the Contractor and may not exceed $50,000 without the
        written approval of MNsure. If the Contractor desires authority from the State to have a deductible in a
        higher amount, the Contractor shall so request in writing, specifying the amount of the desired
        deductible and providing financial documentation by submitting the most current audited financial
        statements so that the State can ascertain the ability of the Contractor to cover the deductible from its
        own resources.

        The retroactive or prior acts date of such coverage shall not be after the effective date of this Contract
        and Contractor shall maintain such insurance for a period of at least three (3) years, following
        completion of the work. If such insurance is discontinued, extended reporting period coverage must be
        obtained by Contractor to fulfill this requirement.

            b) Actions that give rise to strict liability; or
            c) Breach of contract or warranty.
      The indemnification obligations of this section do not apply in the event the claim or cause of action is
      the result of State’s sole negligence. This clause will not be construed to bar any legal remedies
      Contractor may have for State’s failure to fulfill its obligation under this Contract.

9.    State Audits
      Under Minnesota Statutes § 16C.05, subdivision 5, Contractor’s books, records, documents, and
      accounting procedures and practices relevant to this Contract are subject to examination by State and/or
      the State Auditor or Legislative Auditor, as appropriate, for a minimum of six (6) years from the end of
      this Contract.

10.   Government Data Practices and Intellectual Property
      10.1 Government Data Practices. The Contractor and State must comply with the Minnesota
           Government Data Practices Act, Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13, as it applies to all data provided
           by the State under this Contract, and as it applies to all data created, collected, received, stored,
           used, maintained, or disseminated by the Contractor under this Contract. The civil remedies of
           Minnesota Statutes § 13.08 apply to the release of the data governed by the Minnesota
           Government Practices Act, Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13, by either the Contractor or the State.

            If the Contractor receives a request to release the data referred to in this clause, the Contractor
            must immediately notify and consult with the State’s Authorized Representative as to how the
            Contractor should respond to the request. The Contractor’s response to the request shall comply
            with applicable law.

           Additionally, Contractor and State must comply with the requirements contained in Attachment 1,
           which is incorporated by reference into this Contract.
      10.2 Intellectual Property Rights
           (a) Intellectual Property Rights. The State owns all rights, title, and interest in all of the
                 intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and
                 service marks in the works and documents created and paid for under this Contract. The
                 “works” means all inventions, improvements, discoveries (whether or not patentable),
                 databases, computer programs, reports, notes, studies, photographs, negatives, designs,
                 drawings, specifications, materials, tapes, and disks conceived, reduced to practice, created
                 or originated by the Contractor, its employees, agents, and subcontractors, either individually
                 or jointly with others in the performance of this Contract. “Works” includes documents. The
                 “documents” are the originals of any databases, computer programs, reports, notes, studies,
                 photographs, negatives, designs, drawings, specifications, materials, tapes, disks, or other
                 materials, whether in tangible or electronic forms, prepared by the Contractor, its employees,
                 agents, or subcontractors, in the performance of this Contract. The documents will be the
                 exclusive property of the State and all such documents must be immediately returned to the
                 State by the Contractor upon completion or cancellation of this Contract. To the extent
                 possible, those works eligible for copyright protection under the United States Copyright Act
                 will be deemed to be “works made for hire.” The Contractor assigns all right, title, and interest
                 it may have in the works and the documents to the State. The Contractor must, at the request
                 of the State, execute all papers and perform all other acts necessary to transfer or record the
                 State’s ownership interest in the works and documents.
           (b)   Obligations
                 (1) Notification. Whenever any invention, improvement, or discovery (whether or not
                       patentable) is made or conceived for the first time or actually or constructively reduced
                       to practice by the Contractor, including its employees and subcontractors, in the
                       performance of this Contract, the Contractor will immediately give the State’s
                       Authorized Representative written notice thereof, and must promptly furnish the State’s
                       Authorized Representative with complete information and/or disclosure thereon.
                 (2) Representation. The Contractor must perform all acts, and take all steps necessary to
                       ensure that all intellectual property rights in the works and documents are the sole
                       property of the State, and that neither Contractor nor its employees, agents, or
                       subcontractors retain any interest in and to the works and documents. The Contractor
                       represents and warrants that the works and documents do not and will not infringe upon
                       any intellectual property rights of other persons or entities. Notwithstanding Clause 8,
                       the Contractor will indemnify; defend, to the extent permitted by the Attorney General;
                       and hold harmless the State, at the Contractor’s expense, from any action or claim
                       brought against the State to the extent that it is based on a claim that all or part of the
                       works or documents infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. The
                       Contractor will be responsible for payment of any and all such claims, demands,
                       obligations, liabilities, costs, and damages, including but not limited to, attorney fees. If
                       such a claim or action arises, or in the Contractor’s or the State’s opinion is likely to
                       arise, the Contractor must, at the State’s discretion, either procure for the State the right
                       or license to use the intellectual property rights at issue or replace or modify the
                       allegedly infringing works or documents as necessary and appropriate to obviate the
                       infringement claim. This remedy of the State will be in addition to and not exclusive of
                       other remedies provided by law.

11.   Workers Compensation and Other Insurance
      11.1 Contractor shall not commence work under the Contract until Contractor has obtained all the

                    If Minnesota Statutes § 176.041 exempts Contractor from Workers Compensation
                    insurance or if Contractor has no employees in the State of Minnesota, Contractor must
                    provide a written statement, signed by an authorized representative, indicating the
                    qualifying exemption that excludes Contractor from the Minnesota Workers
                    Compensation requirements.

                    If during the course of the contract Contractor becomes eligible for Workers
                    Compensation, Contractor must comply with the Workers Compensation Insurance
                    requirements herein and provide State with a certificate of insurance.
               Further, Contractor certifies that it is in compliance with Minnesota Statutes § 176.181,
               subdivision 2, pertaining to workers compensation insurance coverage. Contractor’s
               employees and agents will not be considered State employees. Any claims that may arise
               under the Minnesota Workers Compensation Act on behalf of these employees or agents
               and any claims made by any third party as a consequence of any act or omission on the
               part of these employees or agents are in no way State’s obligation or responsibility.
     11.2.2    Commercial General Liability Insurance. Contractor is required to maintain insurance
               protecting it from claims for damages for bodily injury, including sickness or disease,
               death, and for care and loss of services as well as from claims for property damage,
               including loss of use which may arise from operations under the Contract whether the

     11.2.3    Commercial Automobile Liability Insurance. Contractor is required to maintain
               insurance protecting it from claims for damages for bodily injury as well as from claims for
               property damage resulting from the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of all
               owned, hired, and non-owned autos which may arise from operations under this contract,
               and in case any work is subcontracted the contractor will require the subcontractor to
               maintain Commercial Automobile Liability insurance. Insurance minimum limits are as

                     $2,000,000 – annual aggregate
               Any deductible will be the sole responsibility of Contractor and may not exceed $50,000
               without the written approval of State. If Contractor desires authority from State to have a
               deductible in a higher amount, Contractor shall so request in writing, specifying the
               amount of the desired deductible and providing financial documentation by submitting the
               most current audited financial statements so that State can ascertain the ability of
               Contractor to cover the deductible from its own resources.

             The retroactive or prior acts date of such coverage shall not be after the effective date of
             this Contract and Contractor shall maintain such insurance for a period of at least three

             herein, Contractor agrees to notify State within five (5) business days with a copy of the

                     afforded under the policy(ies) will not be cancelled without at least thirty (30) days
                     advance written notice to State;

12.   Debarment by State, its Departments, Commissions, Agencies, or Political Subdivisions
      Contractor certifies that neither it nor its principals is presently debarred or suspended by the State of
      Minnesota, or any of its departments, commissions, agencies, or political subdivisions. Contractor’s
      certification is a material representation upon which the Contract award was based. Contractor shall
      provide immediate written notice to State’s Authorized Representative if at any time it learns that this
      certification was erroneous when submitted or becomes erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

13.   Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility, and Voluntary Exclusion
      Federal money will be used to pay for all or part of the work under the Contract; therefore Contractor
      certifies that it is in compliance with federal requirements on debarment, suspension, ineligibility and
      voluntary exclusion specified in the solicitation document implementing Executive Order 12549.
      Contractor’s certification is a material representation upon which the Contract award was based.
      13.1 By signing and submitting this Contract, Contractor is providing the certification set out below.
      13.2 The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed
               when this transaction was entered into. If it is later determined that Contractor knowingly
               rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal
               Government, State may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.
      13.3 Contractor shall provide immediate written notice to State’s Authorized Representative if at any
               time Contractor learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or had become
               erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
      13.4 The terms covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, lower tier covered transaction,
               participant, person, primary covered transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded, as
               used in this clause, have the meaning set out in the Definitions and Coverages sections of rules
               implementing Executive Order 12549.
      13.5 Contractor agrees that upon execution of this this Contract, it shall not knowingly enter into any
               lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9,
               subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation
               in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the department or agency with which this
               transaction originated.
      13.6 Contractor further agrees that it will include this clause titled “Certification Regarding Debarment,
               Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion--Lower Tier Covered Transaction,” without
               modification, in all lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier covered
               transactions.
      13.7 A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective participant in
               a lower tier covered transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9,
               subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from covered transactions,
               unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and
               frequency by which it determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but is not
               required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement
               Programs.
      13.8 Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of
               records in order to render in good faith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge
               and information of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a
            prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
      13.9  Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 13.5 of these instructions, if a participant in a
            covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is
            proposed for debarment under 48 C.F.R. 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, ineligible, or
            voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies available
            to the Federal government, State may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or
            debarment.
      13.10 Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion -
            Lower Tier Covered Transactions
            13.10.1 Contractor certifies, that neither it nor its principals is presently debarred, suspended,
                      proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in
                      this transaction by any Federal department or agency.
            13.10.2 Where Contractor is unable to certify to any of the statements in this certification, such
                      prospective participant shall attach an explanation to this proposal.

14.   Publicity and Endorsement
      14.1 Publicity. Any publicity regarding the subject matter of this Contract must identify State as the
           sponsoring agency and must not be released without prior written approval from State’s Authorized
           Representative. For purposes of this provision, publicity includes any and all communications with
           the media or press with respect to the program, publications, or services provided resulting from
           this Contract, and any notices, informational pamphlets, press releases, research, reports, signs,
           and similar public notices prepared by or for Contractor individually or jointly with others, or any
           subcontractors, with respect to the program, publications, or services provided resulting from this
           Contract.
      14.2 Endorsement. Contractor must not claim that State endorses its products or services.

15.   Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue
      Minnesota law, without regard to its choice-of-law provisions, governs this Contract. Venue for all legal
      proceedings out of this Contract, or its breach, must be in the appropriate state or federal court with
      competent jurisdiction in Ramsey County, Minnesota.

16.   Data Disclosure
      Under Minnesota Statutes § 270C.65, subdivision 3 and other applicable law, Contractor consents to
      disclosure of its social security number, federal employer tax identification number, and/or Minnesota tax
      identification number, already provided to State, to federal and state agencies, and state personnel
      involved in the payment of state obligations. These identification numbers may be used in the
      enforcement of federal and state laws which could result in action requiring Contractor to file state tax
      returns, pay delinquent state tax liabilities, if any, or pay other state liabilities.

17.   Payment to Subcontractors
      As required by Minnesota Statutes § 16A.1245, the prime Contractor must pay all subcontractors, less
      any retainage, within ten (10) calendar days of the prime Contractor's receipt of payment from State for
      undisputed services provided by the subcontractor(s) and must pay interest at the rate of one and one-
      half percent per month or any part of a month to the subcontractor(s) on any undisputed amount not paid
      on time to the subcontractor(s).

18.   Termination
      18.1 Termination by the State. State may cancel this Contract at any time, with or without cause, upon
           thirty (30) calendar days written notice to Contractor. Upon termination, Contractor will be entitled
           to payment, determined on a pro rata basis, for services satisfactorily performed.
      18.2 Termination for Insufficient Funding. State may immediately terminate this Contract if it does not
           obtain funding from the Minnesota Legislature, or other funding sources, or if funding is not
           received or made available at a level sufficient to allow for the payment of the services covered
           here. Termination must be by written, e-mail or fax notice to Contractor. State is not obligated to
           pay for any services that are provided after notice and effective date of termination. However,
           Contractor will be entitled to payment, determined on a pro rata basis, for services satisfactorily
           performed to the extent that funds are available. State will not be assessed any penalty if the
           Contract is terminated because of the decision of the Minnesota Legislature, or other funding
           sources, not to appropriate funds or to otherwise prohibit such use of or deny access to funds.
           State must provide Contractor notice of the lack of funding within a reasonable time of State
           receiving that notice.

19.   Non-discrimination (In accordance with Minnesota Statutes § 181.59)
      Contractor will comply with the provisions of Minnesota Statutes § 181.59 which requires:
           “Every contract for or on behalf of the state of Minnesota, or any county, city, town, township,
           school, school district, or any other district in the state, for materials, supplies, or construction shall
           contain provisions by which the contractor agrees:
                 (1) that, in the hiring of common or skilled labor for the performance of any work under any
                 contract, or any subcontract, no contractor, material supplier, or vendor, shall, by reason of
                 race, creed, or color, discriminate against the person or persons who are citizens of the
                 United States or resident aliens who are qualified and available to perform the work to which
                 the employment relates;
                 (2) that no contractor, material supplier, or vendor, shall, in any manner, discriminate against,
                 or intimidate, or prevent the employment of any person or persons identified in clause (1) of
