    A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
 1. Introduction   1.1   Proposers shall adhere to all the requirements of this RFP, including any
                         amendments in writing by UNDP. This RFP is conducted in accordance with the
                         UNDP Programme and Operations Policies and Procedures (POPP) on
                         Contracts and Procurement which can be accessed at

                         476a-8ef8-e81f93a2b38d
                   1.2   Any Proposal submitted will be regarded as an offer by the Proposer and does
                         not constitute or imply the acceptance of the Proposal by UNDP. UNDP is under
                         no obligation to award a contract to any Proposer as a result of this RFP.
                   1.3   As part of the bid, it is desired that the Proposer registers at the United Nations
                         Global Marketplace (UNGM) website (www.ungm.org). The Proposer may still
                         submit a bid even if not registered with the UNGM. However, if the Proposer is
                         selected for contract award, the Proposer must register on the UNGM prior to
                         contract signature.

 2. Fraud &        2.1   UNDP strictly enforces a policy of zero tolerance on proscribed practices,
    Corruption,          including fraud, corruption, collusion, unethical or unprofessional practices,
                         and obstruction of UNDP vendors and requires all proposers/vendors observe
    Gifts and
                         the highest standard of ethics during the procurement process and contract
    Hospitality          implementation. UNDP’s Anti-Fraud Policy can be found at
                         http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/operations/accountability/audit/offic
                         e_of_audit_andinvestigation.html#anti

                   2.2   Proposers/vendors shall not offer gifts or hospitality of any kind to UNDP staff
                         members including recreational trips to sporting or cultural events, theme
                         parks or offers of holidays, transportation, or invitations to extravagant lunches
                         or dinners.
                   2.3   In pursuance of this policy, UNDP
                         (a) Shall reject a proposal if it determines that the selected proposer has
                         engaged in any corrupt or fraudulent practices in competing for the contract in
                         question;
                         (b) Shall declare a vendor ineligible, either indefinitely or for a stated period of
                         time, to be awarded a contract if at any time it determines that the vendor has
                         engaged in any corrupt or fraudulent practices in competing for, or in
                         executing a UNDP contract.
                   2.4   All Proposers must adhere to the UN Supplier Code of Conduct, which may be
                         found at http://www.un.org/depts/ptd/pdf/conduct_english.pdf

 3. Eligibility    3.1   A vendor should not be suspended, debarred, or otherwise identified as
                         ineligible by any UN Organization or the World Bank Group or any other
                         international Organization. Vendors are therefore required to disclose to UNDP
                         whether they are subject to any sanction or temporary suspension imposed by
                         these organizations.
                   3.2   It is the Proposer’s responsibility to ensure that its employees, joint venture
                         members, sub-contractors, service providers, suppliers and/or their employees

                                                                                                         5
4. Conflict of Interests   4.1   Proposers must strictly avoid conflicts with other assignments or their own
                                 interests, and act without consideration for future work. Proposers found to
                                 have a conflict of interest shall be disqualified. Without limitation on the
                                 generality of the above, Proposers, and any of their affiliates, shall be considered
                                 to have a conflict of interest with one or more parties in this solicitation process,
                                 if they:
                                 a)   Are or have been associated in the past, with a firm or any of its affiliates
                                      which have been engaged by UNDP to provide services for the preparation
                                      of the design, specifications, Terms of Reference, cost analysis/estimation,
                                      and other documents to be used for the procurement of the goods and
                                      services in this selection process;
                                 b) Were involved in the preparation and/or design of the programme/project
                                      related to the services requested under this RFP; or
                                 c) Are found to be in conflict for any other reason, as may be established by,
                                      or at the discretion of UNDP.
                           4.2   In the event of any uncertainty in the interpretation of a potential conflict of
                                 interest, Proposers must disclose to UNDP, and seek UNDP’s confirmation on
                                 whether or not such a conflict exists.
                           4.3   Similarly, the Proposers must disclose in their proposal their knowledge of the
                                 following:
                                 a)   If the owners, part-owners, officers, directors, controlling shareholders, of
                                      the bidding entity or key personnel are family members of UNDP staff
                                      involved in the procurement functions and/or the Government of the
                                      country or any Implementing Partner receiving services under this RFP; and
                                 b)   All other circumstances that could potentially lead to actual or perceived
                                      conflict of interest, collusion or unfair competition practices.
                                 Failure to disclose such an information may result in the rejection of the proposal
                                 or proposals affected by the non-disclosure.
                           4.4   The eligibility of Proposers that are wholly or partly owned by the Government
                                 shall be subject to UNDP’s further evaluation and review of various factors such
                                 as being registered, operated and managed as an independent business entity,
                                 the extent of Government ownership/share, receipt of subsidies, mandate and
                                 access to information in relation to this RFP, among others. Conditions that may
                                 lead to undue advantage against other Proposers may result in the eventual
                                 rejection of the Proposal.

                           5.2   The Proposer will not be permitted to take advantage of any errors or omissions
                                 in the RFP. Should such errors or omissions be discovered, the Proposer must

                            assessment by UNDP.
                     14.5   A JV, Consortium or Association in presenting its track record and experience
                            should clearly differentiate between:
                            a)   Those that were undertaken together by the JV, Consortium or Association;
                                 and
                            b)   Those that were undertaken by the individual entities of the JV, Consortium

                            cannot be claimed as the experience of the JV, Consortium or Association or
                            those of its members, but should only be claimed by the individual experts

                                                                                                           8
                              themselves in their presentation of their individual credentials.
                       14.7   JV, Consortium or Associations are encouraged for high value, multi-sectoral

                       16.2   During the Proposal validity period, the Proposer shall maintain its original
                              Proposal without any change, including the availability of the Key Personnel, the

   Proposal                   the date indicated in the BDS. Any request for clarification must be sent in writing
                              in the manner indicated in the BDS. If inquiries are sent other than specified
                              channel, even if they are sent to a UNDP staff member, UNDP shall have no
                              obligation to respond or confirm that the query was officially received.
                       18.2   UNDP will provide the responses to clarifications through the method specified
                              in the BDS.

                              manner, but any delay in such response shall not cause an obligation on the part
                              of UNDP to extend the submission date of the Proposals, unless UNDP deems
                              that such an extension is justified and necessary.



                                                                                                              9
19.Amendment of         19.1   At any time prior to the deadline of Proposal submission, UNDP may for any
   Proposals                   reason, such as in response to a clarification requested by a Proposer, modify

                               available to all prospective proposers.
                        19.2   If the amendment is substantial, UNDP may extend the Deadline for submission

                               may submit an alternative proposal, but only if it also submits a proposal
                               conforming to the RFP requirements. UNDP shall only consider the alternative
                               proposal offered by the Proposer whose conforming proposal ranked the
                               highest as per the specified evaluation method. Where the conditions for its
                               acceptance are met, or justifications are clearly established, UNDP reserves the
                               right to award a contract based on an alternative proposal.
                        20.2   If multiple/alternative proposals are being submitted, they must be clearly
                               marked as “Main Proposal” and “Alternative Proposal”

21.Pre-Bid Conference   21.1   When appropriate, a Proposer’s conference will be conducted at the date, time
                               and location specified in the BDS. All Proposers are encouraged to attend. Non-
                               attendance, however, shall not result in disqualification of an interested
                               Proposer. Minutes of the Proposer’s conference will be disseminated on the
                               procurement website and shared by email or on the e-Tendering platform as
                               specified in the BDS. No verbal statement made during the conference shall
                               modify the terms and conditions of the RFP, unless specifically incorporated in
                               the Minutes of the Proposer’s Conference or issued/posted as an amendment to
                               RFP.

                               a)   The Financial Proposal file must be encrypted with a password so that it
                                    cannot be opened nor viewed until the password is provided. The password
                                    for opening the Financial Proposal should be provided only upon request of
                                    UNDP. UNDP will request password only from proposers whose technical


                                                                                                         10
                                    proposal has been found to be technically responsive. Failure to provide the
                                    correct password may result in the proposal being rejected.
                               c)   Documents which are required to be in original form (e.g. Bid Security, etc.)
                                    must be sent via courier or hand delivery as per the instructions in BDS.

   D. EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS
26.Confidentiality      26.1   Information relating to the examination, evaluation, and comparison of
                               Proposals, and the recommendation of contract award, shall not be disclosed to
                               Proposers or any other persons not officially concerned with such process, even
                               after publication of the contract award.
                        26.2   Any effort by a Proposer or anyone on behalf of the Proposer to influence UNDP
                               in the examination, evaluation and comparison of the Proposals or contract
                               award decisions may, at UNDP’s decision, result in the rejection of its Proposal
                               and may be subject to the application of prevailing UNDP’s vendor sanctions
                               procedures.

27.Evaluation of        27.1   The Proposer is not permitted to alter or modify its Proposal in any way after the

                                                                                                            11
   Proposals                    proposal submission deadline except as permitted under Clause 24 of this RFP.
                                UNDP will conduct the evaluation solely on the basis of the submitted Technical
                                and Financial Proposals.
                         27.2   Evaluation of proposals is made of the following steps:
                                a) Preliminary Examination
                                b) Minimum Eligibility and Qualification (if pre-qualification is not done)
                                c) Evaluation of Technical Proposals
                                d) Evaluation of Financial Proposals

28.Preliminary           28.1   UNDP shall examine the Proposals to determine whether they are complete with
   Examination                  respect to minimum documentary requirements, whether the documents have
                                been properly signed, and whether the Proposals are generally in order, among
                                other indicators that may be used at this stage. UNDP reserves the right to reject
                                any Proposal at this stage.

29.Evaluation of         29.1   Eligibility and Qualification of the Proposer will be evaluated against the
   Eligibility and              Minimum Eligibility/Qualification requirements specified in the Section 4
                                (Evaluation Criteria).
   Qualification
                         29.2   In general terms, vendors that meet the following criteria may be considered
                                qualified:
                                 a) They are not included in the UN Security Council 1267/1989 Committee's
                                      list of terrorists and terrorist financiers, and in UNDP’s ineligible vendors’
                                      list;
                                 b) They have a good financial standing and have access to adequate financial
                                      resources to perform the contract and all existing commercial
                                      commitments,
                                 c) They have the necessary similar experience, technical expertise, production
                                      capacity where applicable, quality certifications, quality assurance
                                      procedures and other resources applicable to the provision of the services
                                      required;
                                 d) They are able to comply fully with UNDP General Terms and Conditions of
                                      Contract;
                                 e) They do not have a consistent history of court/arbitral award decisions
                                      against the Proposer; and
                                 f) They have a record of timely and satisfactory performance with their clients.

30.Evaluation of         30.1   The evaluation team shall review and evaluate the Technical Proposals on the
   Technical and                basis of their responsiveness to the Terms of Reference and other RFP
                                documents, applying the evaluation criteria, sub-criteria, and point system
   Financial Proposals
                                specified in the Section 4 (Evaluation Criteria). A Proposal shall be rendered non-
                                responsive at the technical evaluation stage if it fails to achieve the minimum
                                technical score indicated in the BDS. When necessary and if stated in the BDS,
                                UNDP may invite technically responsive proposers for a presentation related to
                                their technical proposals. The conditions for the presentation shall be provided
                                in the bid document where required.
                         30.2   In the second stage, only the Financial Proposals of those Proposers who achieve
                                the minimum technical score will be opened for evaluation. The Financial
                                Proposals corresponding to Technical Proposals that were rendered non-
                                responsive shall remain unopened, and, in the case of manual submission, be
                                returned to the Proposer unopened. For emailed Proposals and e-tendering
                                submissions, UNDP will not request for the password of the Financial Proposals
                                of proposers whose Technical Proposal were found not responsive.
                         30.3   The evaluation method that applies for this RFP shall be as indicated in the BDS,
                                which may be either of two (2) possible methods, as follows: (a) the lowest priced

                                                                                                              12
                              method which selects the lowest evaluated financial proposal of the technically
                              responsive Proposers; or (b) the combined scoring method which will be based
                              on a combination of the technical and financial score.
                       30.4   When the BDS specifies a combined scoring method, the formula for the rating
                              of the Proposals will be as follows:

                          Rating the Technical Proposal (TP):

                                 TP Rating = (Total Score Obtained by the Offer / Max. Obtainable Score for TP) x
                          100

                          Rating the Financial Proposal (FP):

                                 FP Rating = (Lowest Priced Offer / Price of the Offer Being Reviewed) x 100

                          Total Combined Score:


                          Combined Score = (TP Rating) x (Weight of TP, e.g. 70%) + (FP Rating) x (Weight of FP,

                          e.g., 30%)




31. Due Diligence      31.1   UNDP reserves the right to undertake a due diligence exercise, also called post
                              qualification, aimed at determining to its satisfaction, the validity of the
                              information provided by the Proposer. Such exercise shall be fully documented
                              and may include, but need not be limited to, all or any combination of the
                              following:
                                a)   Verification of accuracy, correctness and authenticity of information
                                     provided by the Proposer;
                                b)   Validation of extent of compliance to the RFP requirements and evaluation
                                     criteria based on what has so far been found by the evaluation team;
                                c)   Inquiry and reference checking with Government entities with jurisdiction
                                     on the Proposer, or with previous clients, or any other entity that may have
                                     done business with the Proposer;
                                d)   Inquiry and reference checking with previous clients on the performance
                                     on on-going or contracts completed, including physical inspections of
                                     previous works, as necessary;
                                e)   Physical inspection of the Proposer’s offices, branches or other places
                                     where business transpires, with or without notice to the Proposer;
                                f)   Other means that UNDP may deem appropriate, at any stage within the
                                     selection process, prior to awarding the contract.

32.Clarification of    32.1   To assist in the examination, evaluation and comparison of Proposals, UNDP
   Proposals                  may, at its discretion, ask any Proposer for a clarification of its Proposal.
                       32.2   UNDP’s request for clarification and the response shall be in writing and no
                              change in the prices or substance of the Proposal shall be sought, offered, or
                              permitted, except to provide clarification, and confirm the correction of any
                              arithmetic errors discovered by UNDP in the evaluation of the Proposals, in
                              accordance with RFP.
                       32.3   Any unsolicited clarification submitted by a Proposer in respect to its Proposal,
                              which is not a response to a request by UNDP, shall not be considered during
                              the review and evaluation of the Proposals.

33.Responsiveness of   33.1   UNDP’s determination of a Proposal’s responsiveness will be based on the
                              contents of the Proposal itself. A substantially responsive Proposal is one that

                                                                                                               13
   Proposal                    conforms to all the terms, conditions, TOR and other requirements of the RFP
                               without material deviation, reservation, or omission.
                        33.2   If a Proposal is not substantially responsive, it shall be rejected by UNDP and
                               may not subsequently be made responsive by the Proposer by correction of the
                               material deviation, reservation, or omission.

34.Nonconformities,     34.1   Provided that a Proposal is substantially responsive, UNDP may waive any non-
   Reparable Errors            conformities or omissions in the Proposal that, in the opinion of UNDP, do not
                               constitute a material deviation.
   and Omissions
                        34.2   UNDP may request the Proposer to submit the necessary information or
                               documentation, within a reasonable period of time, to rectify nonmaterial
                               nonconformities or omissions in the Proposal related to documentation
                               requirements. Such omission shall not be related to any aspect of the price of
                               the Proposal. Failure of the Proposer to comply with the request may result in
                               the rejection of its Proposal.
                        34.3   For Financial Proposal that has been opened, UNDP shall check and correct
                               arithmetical errors as follows:
                                 a)   if there is a discrepancy between the unit price and the line item total that
                                      is obtained by multiplying the unit price by the quantity, the unit price
                                      shall prevail and the line item total shall be corrected, unless in the opinion
                                      of UNDP there is an obvious misplacement of the decimal point in the unit
                                      price; in which case the line item total as quoted shall govern and the unit
                                      price shall be corrected;
                                 b)   if there is an error in a total corresponding to the addition or subtraction
                                      of subtotals, the subtotals shall prevail and the total shall be corrected;
                                      and
                                 c)   if there is a discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words
                                      shall prevail, unless the amount expressed in words is related to an
                                      arithmetic error, in which case the amount in figures shall prevail.
                        34.4   If the Proposer does not accept the correction of errors made by UNDP, its
                               Proposal shall be rejected.

   E. AWARD OF CONTRACT
35.Right to Accept,     35.1   UNDP reserves the right to accept or reject any Proposal, to render any or all of
   Reject, Any or All          the Proposals as non-responsive, and to reject all Proposals at any time prior to
                               award of contract, without incurring any liability, or obligation to inform the
   Proposals
                               affected Proposer(s) of the grounds for UNDP’s action. UNDP shall not be
                               obliged to award the contract to the lowest priced offer.

36.Award Criteria       36.1   Prior to expiration of the proposal validity, UNDP shall award the contract to the
                               qualified Proposer based on the award criteria indicated in the BDS.

37.Debriefing           37.1   In the event that a Proposer is unsuccessful, the Proposer may request a
                               debriefing from UNDP. The purpose of the debriefing is to discuss the strengths
                               and weaknesses of the Proposer’s submission, in order to assist the Proposer in
                               improving its future proposals for UNDP procurement opportunities. The
                               content of other proposals and how they compare to the Proposer’s submission
                               shall not be discussed.

38.Right to Vary        38.1   At the time of award of Contract, UNDP reserves the right to vary the quantity
   Requirements at             of services and/or goods, by up to a maximum twenty-five per cent (25%) of the
                               total offer, without any change in the unit price or other terms and conditions.

                                                                                                               14
   the Time of Award

                                so may constitute sufficient grounds for the annulment of the award, and
                                forfeiture of the Proposal Security, if any, and on which event, UNDP may award
                                the Contract to the Second Ranked Proposer or call for new Proposals.

45.Vendor Protest        45.1   UNDP’s vendor protest procedure provides an opportunity for appeal to those
                                persons or firms not awarded a contract through a competitive procurement
                                process. In the event that a Proposer believes that it was not treated fairly, the

                                price. The UNDP General Terms and Conditions shall have precedence.
