By completing this form, you are helping us by providing access to your prior medical records to compare with
your new exam. If you do not remember all of the details of your prior exam, our staff will try to assist you in
locating those records. Providing comparison images is extremely helpful to the radiologist during the
interpretation of your new exam and sometimes eliminates the need for additional imaging.
