                                          To speed up our processing remember to:
  Separate claim forms are necessary for different patients. You will also need and use another claim form for each of the different
  programs (medical, dental, vision, hearing).
  Mail only original receipts including all pertinent information on provider's letterhead. Without this information your claim will
  be returned to you. Cash register receipts, cancelled checks, money orders, and personal itemizations cannot be used in benefit
  payment consideration.
  If the patient has Medicare coverage, fill in the Medicare number including alpha characters. Be sure you include the Medicare
  Summary Notice that was sent explaining the charges paid or not paid by Medicare. This is not required for dental, vision or
  hearing services.
  If the patient has other health insurance that has processed the service, be sure you include the Explanation of Benefit statement
  that was sent explaining the charges paid or not paid.
  Make copies of the original receipts for your files before submitting the original. All materials submitted will be retained for our
  files and cannot be returned to you.

                     YOUR RIGHT TO CONFIDENTIALITY: We will not release any information about you except:
                     (1) When you ask us to in writing or (2) When release (to another insurance company for
                     example) is necessary to process or review a claim. We will tell you which information we release
                     to whom, if you request it.
