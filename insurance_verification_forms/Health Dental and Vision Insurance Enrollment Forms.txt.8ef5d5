             Completing and Submitting Insurance Enrollment Forms - New Hire

If you do not wish to enroll:

    ➢ You must complete the Health, Dental and Vision forms on-line indicating that you wish to

         Enroll or Waive must be entered online for each insurance coverage.


______________________________________________________________________________________________
Effective date of coverage when you enroll as a New Hire: Your official date of hire which is 7/1/20 or
8/1/20 regardless of any orientation or other sessions you may attend prior to that date.

NOTE: You should make sure that your current Health and Disability insurance coverages continue through 6/30/20
if you have options to do so. If you need other Health or Disability insurance for coverage prior to 7/1/20, you can contact
the MCWAH Benefits Coordinator (smonroe@mcw.edu) who will put you in contact with someone to discuss temporary
insurance options that may be available for coverage prior to 7/1/20 for you to purchase as an individual. You should
contact the MCWAH Benefits Coordinator at least 10 days in advance of when you will need the temporary coverage to
begin, and, if you have existing coverage, before that coverage ends.

    •    You can update your address by calling the insurance companies or logging into your account on their
         websites once you have received your Member ID cards.
    •    If you do not have an address in the United States, you will need to wait until you have one to enroll.
         Provide an U.S. address to the MCWAH office as soon as possible. Your insurance enrollments cannot be
         processed until we have an U.S. address but must be received before 30 days after your hire date.


Member ID Cards: You need to wait at least 15 days after your enrollment forms were submitted to receive your
ID cards. If you have not received your ID cards at that time:

    •    You should contact the insurance company at the customer service phone numbers on the website.

    •    When calling WPS Health insurance (1-800-223-6048): Press “1” (Member), wait past the translation

Qualifying Events – ALL Enrollments and changes thereto are subject to underwriting by

a) Marriage → Within 30 days of marriage, you can add or change to Family Coverage. The effective date of the event
and the effective date of the new coverage is the date of marriage. The enrollment change form must be signed on or after
the marriage date.

b) Add Newborn Child to Existing Family Coverage → Coverage is provided from the time of the Child’s birth. You
can email your name + the Child’s name, gender, and birth date to gme@mcw.edu within 30 days of the Child’s birth.

c) Changing from Single to Family Coverage due to a Newborn Child → Under the existing Single Coverage, coverage
is provided for the newborn from the moment of the Child’s birth and for the next 60 days after birth. To extend coverage
beyond the first 60 days, an enrollment form must be submitted to change to Family Coverage. The effective date of the

enrollment change must be submitted within 30 days.



G:\Insurance\WPS20-21\Incoming\Web\Healthdentalvisioninsuranceenrollmentpacket\WPS Enrollment Form Cover POP (5-4-20).Doc
d) Changing from NO Coverage to Family Coverage due to a Newborn Child → The new enrollment form must be
submitted within 30 days of birth. The effective date of that event and the effective date of the new coverage is the date of
birth.

e) Adoption of a child → Similar to the addition of a newborn child. Based upon when the child is placed for adoption
and\or the date of the final court order granting adoption. Email gme@mcw.edu within 30 days of the event for additional
information if this event applies to you.

f) Adding a Dependant to Existing Single or Family Coverage due to Court Order → Email gme@mcw.edu within 30
days of the event for additional information if this event applies to you.

g) Housestaff, their Spouse, or Other Dependant Loses Coverage under other Creditable Prior Coverage → If you
(or a dependant) did not enroll in the MCWAH WPS Health Insurance Plan when you otherwise could have enrolled,
because you (they) were covered by other creditable coverage at that time; you can enroll for Single or Family Coverage if
you (they) lose that Coverage either voluntarily or involuntarily. You (they) must have been covered under creditable prior
coverage at the time you otherwise could have enrolled. You must apply for the Single or Family Coverage within 30 days
of the effective date of the loss of the prior coverage. [Example: Spouse loses their coverage (or you lose coverage under
your Spouse’s plan), voluntarily or involuntarily, under which you and\or your Family were covered at the time you could
have initially enrolled in the MCWAH plan]. In order to make this change on a pre-tax basis, the loss of coverage
generally needs to be due to loss of eligibility or open enrollment at the spouse’s employer.

h) Housestaff, their Spouse, or Other Dependant Gain other Coverage under the spouse or dependent’s employer’s
insurance plan due to a qualifying event → If you (or a dependant) gain other coverage by meeting the qualifying event
requirements of their employer’s plan (new hire, open enrollment, marriage, newborn, etc), you can cancel or reduce
(Family to Single) that coverage by completing an enrollment change form within 30 days of the qualifying event (gain of
other coverage). The change must be consistent with the corresponding gain in coverage with the other employer’s plan.

i) Divorce → Within 30 days of divorce, you MUST complete an enrollment form to drop your former spouse from
coverage as they will no longer be eligible. The effective date of the event and the effective date of the change in coverage
is the 1st of the month following the date of divorce.

j) Other Qualifying Events → There may be other events that qualify for additions or changes in Health Insurance, such
as a spouse moving into the country. A signed and dated enrollment form must be received within 30 days of the qualifying
event date. Email gme@mcw.edu for additional information if you think you might have an event that would qualify.



                                                                       NOTE

Premium Only Plan: Your signed enrollment form to enroll in the Health and\or Dental insurance is also an election to
enroll in the Premium Only Plan (POP) with pre-tax deductions of your portion of the Health and Dental insurance
premiums. This election cannot be changed during the plan year (7/1-6/30) without a qualifying event that is in
compliance with both the insurance company plan certificate and the POP plan document. You must complete, sign, and
date a new enrollment form within the time frame specified for the qualifying event (usually 30 days from the qualifying
event date).

Your current election to the POP plan automatically renews each 7/1 if you do not actively change your enrollment
with the Health and\or Dental insurance company prior to 7/1 (can only be effective 7/1).There can be NO exceptions.

There is an annual open enrollment period each year prior to July 1st in which you can add, change, or waive your Health
or Dental insurance enrollment (and your POP elections) without a qualifying event. The open enrollment forms to
change your Health or Dental insurance enrollment must be completed, signed, and dated and received by the
insurance companies prior to 7/1 (will be effective 7/1). There can be NO exceptions.
