  I.       Introduction

The State Universities Retirement System (âSURSâ or the âSystemâ) is soliciting proposals from qualified and
authorized Partners and Distributors to establish a multi-year Master Services Agreement (MSA) which acts as
a procurement vehicle for Information Technology products, services, solutions and related products and
services.
All forms/required documents needed for submitting a Request for Proposal (âRFPâ) are available on the SURS
website at www.surs.org.
A proposerâs preparation and submittal of a proposal or subsequent participation in presentations or contract
negotiations creates no obligation on the System to award a contract or to pay any associated costs. All
proposals and related materials will be retained by the System and will be subject to disclosure as required in
accordance with the Illinois Freedom of Information Act.


II.        Description of SURS

SURS is the administrator of a cost-sharing, multiple employer, public employee retirement system that
provides retirement, survivor, disability and death benefits to employees of Illinois state universities,
community colleges, and certain other affiliated organizations and agencies. SURS was created in 1941, by an
act of the Illinois General Assembly, and is governed by the Illinois Pension Code (40 ILCS 5/15-101 et seq.).
SURS provides benefit services to over 230,000 members who work for 61 employers. SURS is responsible for
investing assets of more than $19 billion in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and foreign stocks, bonds, real estate
and alternative investments. SURS also administers a defined contribution plan, the Self-Managed Plan, which
currently has assets of approximately $2.2 billion. Northern Trust serves as SURSâ Master Trustee Custodian.

                                                                                    4
An elected and appointed, eleven-person, Board of Trustees, governs SURS. The chairperson of the Board of
Trustees is, by statute, the chairperson of the Illinois Board of Higher Education. Five members of the Board are
appointed by the governor of the state of Illinois. The remaining six members of the Board are elected by
participating members (four individuals) and annuitants (two individuals). Our trustees serve six-year terms.
SURS is funded by participant payroll deductions and annual employer contributions provided by the state of
Illinois. By statute, SURS is defined as a âbody politic and corporateâ created by Article 15 of the Illinois Pension
Code.
SURS currently employs approximately 132 staff, located in 2 offices in Champaign and Naperville, Illinois. Two
SURS employees are in the Naperville office. The remaining SURS employees are situated in the Champaign
office.
A copy of SURSâ most recent Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) is available for review, or to
download, at www.surs.org.
The Illinois Governmental Ethics Act, 40 ILCS 420, provides guidelines for ethical practices concerning state and
local pension plans. Respondent providers should be familiar with the provisions of this Act.
Section 1-109.1(6) of the Illinois Pension Code (40 ILCS 5/1-109.1(6)) encourages Illinois public pension systems
like SURS to utilize businesses owned by âminoritiesâ, âwomenâ, and âpersons with disabilitiesâ for all
contracts and services, as those terms are defined in the Business Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and
Persons with Disabilities Act (âBEMWPDâ,30 ILCS 575). Additionally, Section 1-109.1(10) of the Illinois Pension
Code (40 ILCS 5/1-109.1(10)) sets an aspirational goal of not less than 20% of contracts awarded to such
businesses for "information technology services", "accounting services", "insurance brokers", "architectural
and engineering services", and "legal services" as defined by the BEMWPD. Accordingly, businesses that meet
these definitions are strongly encouraged to submit responses to this RFP.
A section of the Illinois Procurement Code concerning prohibitions of political contributions for vendors, 30
ILCS 500/50-37, may or may not apply to SURS service providers. However, each service provider should be
familiar with the provisions of this section and comply with this section if the service provider deems it
appropriate.
SURS is subject to its own procurement statutes and rules. Responders should be familiar with those
procurement requirements as well. The selected responder will be paid by SURS directly.
Further legal requirements that vendors should be familiar with are contained in the Addendum to Contract
under Appendix D.


III.     Scope of Products and Services Required

The State Universities Retirement System is soliciting proposals from qualified vendor(s) to enter into a Master
Agreement for the procurement of a complete line of Technology Products, Services, Solutions and Related
Products and Services. These include but are not limited to the products and services noted in Appendix E and
Appendix F. SURS reserves the right to select all or some of license products and services listed in Appendix E
that best match its needs and budget for the product.
SURS recognizes that any one Supplier may not provide all product lines. No computer-related products,
supplies or services are excluded from this RFP. All computer product, supplies and accessories carried in a
Supplierâs catalog(s), price book(s) or otherwise available by special order are part of this solicitation. User
conference passes and other training and certification opportunities are in-scope and would be viewed as
value-added offerings.

                                                            5
Multiple awards may be issued as a result of this RFP. Multiple Awards will ensure that any ensuing Master
Agreements fulfill SURS current and future requirements.

Proposals that contain false or misleading statements or that provide references which do not support an
attribute or condition claimed by the proposer will be rejected. Issuance of the Request for Proposal creates no
obligation to award a contract or to pay any costs incurred in the preparation of a proposal. Nothing in this
RFP or any resulting contract shall preclude SURS from procuring services similar to those described herein
from other sources.
During the evaluation process, proposers may be requested to provide additional information and/or clarify
contents of their proposal. Other than information requested by SURS, no proposer will be allowed to alter the
proposal or add new information after the filing date.
Once finalists are selected, fees may be subject to a âbest and finalâ offer process to be determined at the
discretion of the System.

 X.      General Conditions

Freedom of Information Act Disclosure
All materials submitted in response to the RFP become property of SURS. Proposals remain confidential during
the selection process. However, upon completion of the selection process, all responses, including that of the
individual, vendor or firm selected, will be a matter of public information and will be open to public inspection
in accordance with the state of Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
If, in response to this RFP, trade secrets or commercial or financial information are furnished under a claim that
they are proprietary, privileged or confidential and that disclosure of the trade secrets or commercial or
financial information would cause competitive harm to the person or business responding to this RFP, such
claim must be clearly made, and such information must be clearly identified. (5 ILCS 140/7 and 7.5) Responses
to this RFP with every page marked as proprietary, privileged or confidential will not satisfy this
requirement. Bidders are required to make a good faith attempt to properly identify only those portions of the
response that are truly furnished under a claim that they are proprietary, privileged or confidential and that
disclosure of the trade secrets or commercial or financial information would cause competitive harm to the
person or business responding to this RFP.

Redacted Version of RFP Response
In the event Responder believes and claims that certain materials or information contained in the submitted
response are exempt from public disclosure under the Illinois FOIA, Responder is required to provide a
redacted version of the response it believes will be suitable for release under the Illinois Freedom of
Information Act. (5 ILCS 140/7 and 7.5)
A RESPONDERâS FAILURE TO PROVIDE A REDACTED VERSION OF THE RFP WILL RESULT IN SURS DISCLOSING
THE RESPONDERâS ENTIRE RFP RESPONSE IF THE SAME IS REQUESTED UNDER THE ILLINOIS FOIA AND
NEITHER THE RESPONDER NOR ANY THIRD PARTIES SHALL HAVE ANY RECOURSE AGAINST SURS FOR ITS
DISCLOSURE OF THE NON-REDACTED RFP RESPONSE.
However, any claim of privilege from disclosure is not definitive. SURS has the right and legal obligation to
determine whether such information is exempt from disclosure under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act
and no information will be considered or determined by SURS to be proprietary, privileged or confidential
unless it is identified and separated as indicated herein. (5 ILCS 140/7 and 7.5)

Ordinary Course of Business Communications Allowed
Other than existing normal business matters, respondents, potential respondents, or their representatives
should not contact anyone at SURS (including SURS staff, members of the SURS advisory committees and
members of the SURS Board) other than the listed RFP contact. In addition, respondents must not discuss this
RFP with any employee of SURS, trustee of SURS, employee of SURSâ custodian, managers, legal counsel, or
other advisors or persons/entities having contracts or other affiliations with SURS.

SURS Quiet Period Policy
Please note the following Quiet Period Policy establishing guidelines by which the SURS Board of Trustees and
SURS Staff will communicate with prospective vendors or service providers during a search process. The Quiet
Period for this RFP began on the date the RFP was issued: December 21, 2018.

1.   The quiet period shall commence upon Committee action (or Board action if the selection is not initiated
     through a Committee) to authorize a search for a service provider and end once a selection has been made
     by the Board and accepted by the service provider;

2.   Initiation, continuation and conclusion of the quiet period shall be publicly communicated via the SURS
     website (www.SURS.org) to prevent inadvertent violations;

3.   All Board members, and SURS staff not directly involved in the search process, shall refrain from
     communicating with potential service providers regarding any product or service related to the search
     offered by the provider throughout the quiet period and shall refrain from accepting meals, travel, hotel, or
     other value from the providers;

4.   Throughout the quiet period, if any Board member or SURS staff member is contacted by a potential service
     provider, the Board member or SURS staff member shall refer the provider to the SURS staff member
     directly involved in the search process;

5.   All authority related to the search process shall be exercised solely by the relevant Committee or Board as a
     whole, and not by individual Board Members;

6.   All information related to the search process shall be communicated by SURS staff to the relevant
     Committee or Board as a whole, and not to individual Board Members;

7.   The quiet period does not prevent Board approved due diligence, client conference attendance, or
     communications with an existing service provider that happens to be a provider in the ordinary course of
     services provided by such service provider; however, discussions related to the pending selection shall be
     avoided during those activities;
