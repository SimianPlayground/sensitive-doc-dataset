                    Employee Direct Deposit Enrollment Form
To enroll in full service direct deposit, simply fill out this form and return to the central office. Attach a voided check for your
account. Ask your bank to give you the Routing/ Transit Number for your account. It isnâ€™t always the same as the number on a
savings deposit slip. This will help ensure that you are paid correctly.

Below is a sample check MICR line, detailing where the information necessary to complete this form can be found.
