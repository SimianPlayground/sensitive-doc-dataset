The following information highlights certain form completion instructions. Comprehensive ADA Dental Claim Form completion instructions
are printed in the CDT manual. Any updates to these instructions will be posted on the ADA’s web site (ADA.org).

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
    A. The form is designed so that the name and address (Item 3) of the third-party payer receiving the claim (insurance company/dental
       benefit plan) is visible in a standard #9 window envelope (window to the left). Please fold the form using the ‘tick-marks’ printed in
       the margin.
    B. Complete all items unless noted otherwise on the form or in the CDT manual’s instructions.
    C. Enter the full name of an individual or a full business name, address and zip code when a name and address field is required.
    D. All dates must include the four-digit year.
    E. If the number of procedures reported exceeds the number of lines available on one claim form, list the remaining procedures on
       a separate, fully completed claim form.

COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB)
When a claim is being submitted to the secondary payer, complete the entire form and attach the primary payer’s Explanation of Benefits
(EOB) showing the amount paid by the primary payer. You may also note the primary carrier paid amount in the “Remarks” field (Item 35).
There are additional detailed completion instructions in the CDT manual.

DIAGNOSIS CODING
The form supports reporting up to four diagnosis codes per dental procedure. This information is required when the diagnosis may affect
claim adjudication when specific dental procedures may minimize the risks associated with the connection between the patient’s oral
and systemic health conditions. Diagnosis codes are linked to procedures using the following fields:
    Item 29a – Diagnosis Code Pointer (“A” through “D” as applicable from Item 34a)
    Item 34 – Diagnosis Code List Qualifier (B for ICD-9-CM; AB for ICD-10-CM)
    Item 34a – Diagnosis Code(s) / A, B, C, D (up to four, with the primary adjacent to the letter “A”)

Services. Frequently used codes are:
    11 = Office; 12 = Home; 21 = Inpatient Hospital; 22 = Outpatient Hospital; 31 = Skilled Nursing Facility; 32 = Nursing Facility
The full list is available online at “www.cms.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/Downloads/Website_POS_database.pdf”
