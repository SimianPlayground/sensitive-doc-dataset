Payment Policies
Thank you for taking the time to understand our payment policies. For any questions about fees, financial policies, or your
responsibilities, please ask one of our office staff for clarification.
For Patients with Dental Insurance
We accept dental insurance assignments, with the understanding that any uninsured portion not covered
by your insurance plan is to be paid by you at the time of service. As a courtesy, our office will file all
applicable insurance forms. Please note that although we strive to provide accurate information, such
information is not a guarantee of payment or eligibility with your insurance company and is only an
estimate. Your dental insurance plan is a contract between you, your employer, and the insurance
company. Depending on your specific insurance plan, your dental insurance may not fully cover our office
dental fees for the services we render. The difference between our office dental fees and your insurance
reimbursement is your responsibility.
Returned Checks
Personal checks that are returned due to "insufficient funds" are subject to a $25.00 service fee.
Service Charge
Payment is due at each appointment. I agree to pay any outstanding insurance balance within 60 days. If I
do not pay the entire new balance within 60 days of the monthly billing date, a service charge will be
added to the account for the current monthly billing period. The service charge will be a periodic rate of
1.5% per month (or a minimum charge of $2.50 for a minimum balance of $25.00) which is an annual
percentage rate of 18% applied to the last month's balance. In case of default of payment, I promise to
pay any legal interest on the balance due, together with any collection costs and reasonable attorney fees
incurred to effect collection of this account balance or any future accounts. Please be advised that there is
a $50.00 fee charged for missed or broken appointments without 24 hours notice. To avoid this charge,
kindly give us a minimum of 24 hours notice for any appointment cancellation. Feel free to contact us at
any time with questions you may have.
X-Ray/Records Release
There is a fee of $25.00 for any release of X-rays and/or records.
Minors
Adult patients are responsible for full payment at time of service. The adult accompanying a minor is
responsible for payment. This office will not bill a non-custodial parent for services delivered to a minor.
For unaccompanied minors, treatment may be denied unless charges have been pre-approved to a credit
card or other payment arrangements have been made.
Authorization
Patient Name:


I hereby authorize payment directly to A&A Orthodontics of the group insurance benefits otherwise

and other information about the patient's dental treatment to third-party payers and/or other health
professionals.

                                    HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices
    This notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can
get access to this information. Please review the following carefully.
    The Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal program that requires
that all medical records and other individually identifiable health information used or disclosed by us in any
form, whether electronically, on paper, or orally, are kept properly confidential. The Act gives you, the
patient, significant new rights to understand and control how your information is used. HIPAA provides
penalties for covered entities that misuse personal health information.
    As required by HIPAA, we have prepared this explanation of how we are required to maintain the
privacy of your health information and how we may use and disclose your health information.
    We may use and disclose your medical records for several purposes, including treatment, payment,
defense of legal matters, to family and friends, and health care operations:
         Treatment includes providing, coordinating, and/or managing health care related services by one or
         more health care providers. An example of this would include teeth cleaning services.
         Payment includes such activities as obtaining reimbursement for services, confirming coverage,
         billing or collection activities, and utilization review. An example of this would be sending a claim for
         your visit to your insurance company for payment.
         Health care operations include the business aspects of running our practice, such as conducting
         quality assessment and improvement activities, auditing functions, cost-management analysis, and
         customer service. An example would be an internal quality assessment review. We may also create
         and distribute de-identified health information by removing all references to individually identifiable
         information.
         To Your Family and Friends: We may disclose your health information to a family member, friend, or
         other person to the extent necessary to help with your healthcare or with payment for your
         healthcare. Before we disclose your health information to these people, we will provide you with an
         opportunity to object to our use or disclosure. If you are not present, or in the event of your
         incapacity or an emergency, we will disclose your medical information based on our professional
         judgment of whether the disclosure would be in your best interest. We may use our professional
         judgment and our experience with common practice to make reasonable inferences of your best
         interest in allowing a person to pick up filled prescriptions, medical supplies, X-rays, or other similar
         forms of health information. We may use or disclose information about you to notify or assist in
         notifying a person involved in your care, of your location and general condition.

   In some limited situations, the law allows or requires us to use/disclose your health information without
your permission. Not all of these situations will apply to us; some may never come up at our office at all.
Such uses or disclosures are:
        When a state or federal law mandates that certain health information be reported for a specific
        purpose
        For public health purposes, such as contagious disease reporting, investigation or surveillance, and
        notices to and from the federal Food and Drug Administration regarding drugs or medical devices
        Disclosures to governmental authorities about victims of suspected abuse, neglect, or domestic
        violence
        Uses and disclosures for health oversight activities, such as for the licensing of doctors; for audits
        by Medicare or Medicaid; or for investigation of possible violations of health care laws
        Disclosures for judicial and administrative proceedings, such as in response to subpoenas or orders

authorization. You may revoke such authorization in writing and we are required to honor and abide by that
written request, except to the extent that we have already taken actions relying on your authorization.
   You have the following rights with respect to your protected health information, which you can exercise
by presenting a written request to the Privacy Officer:
        The right to request restrictions on certain uses and disclosures of protected health information,
        including those related to disclosures to family members, other relatives, close personal friends, or
        any other person identified by you. We are, however, not required to agree to a requested

                                       Our dental practice continually looks for advances to ensure that we are providing the optimum level of
                                   oral healthcare to our patients. We are concerned about oral cancer and look for it in every patient.
                                       One American dies every hour from oral cancer. Late detection of oral cancer is the primary cause of
                                   increasing incidence and mortality rates of oral cancer. As with most cancers, age is the primary risk factor
                                   for oral cancer. Tobacco and alcohol use are other major predisposing risk factors, but more than 25% of
                                   oral cancer victims have no such lifestyle risk factors. Studies also suggest that human papillomavirus
                                   (HPV 16/18) plays a role in more than 20% of oral cancer cases. Oral cancer risk by patient profile is as
                                   follows:
                                            INCREASED RISK: Patients age 18-39, sexually active patients (HPV 16/18)
                                            HIGH RISK: Patients age 40 and older, tobacco users (ages 18-39, any type within 10 years)
                                            HIGHEST RISK: Patients age 40 and older with lifestyle risk factors (tobacco and/or alcohol use);
                                            previous history of oral cancer

                                   ❍ YES - I would like to have the oral cancer exam.
                                   ❍ NO - I would prefer not to have the oral cancer exam at this time.
