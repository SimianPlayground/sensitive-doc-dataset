Section 9: Further information
How to complete this form
     •    If you are personally seeking reimbursement, we will only issue payment to:
          •      the claimant if they are 18 or over
          •      the planholder if the claimant is under 18 and is a dependant under the plan, or
          •      the parent or legal guardian named as the primary participant, if the claimant is under 18
     •    Ensure that you are able to receive payment in the method and currency you have requested.
     •    We reserve the right to pass on any payment charges incurred by us for cancelling the original payment due to inaccurate
          information submitted to us.
     •    We will not be responsible for any payment shortfall due to exchange rate fluctuations and/or recipient bank service charges.
          Please contact your bank for further details.
     •    If you do not give us the sort code/routing code, BIC/SWIFT code and/or IBAN number, you may incur additional bank
          charges and it will result in a delay in us paying your claim. You can find this information on your bank statement.
     •    Payment by foreign draft or cheque in certain currencies can result in long delays. These delays are beyond our control. We
          will not pay any bank charges incurred in encashing a foreign draft or cheque. We strongly recommend that, wherever
          possible, you choose to be reimbursed by bank transfer as this is the quickest and safest method of payment.
     •    We can make payment in most readily traded currencies and to most countries. In the event that we are unable to make
          payment in the currency or to the country you have specified, we will contact you to confirm an alternative currency. If you do
          not specify a payment currency, we will pay your claim in the base currency of your plan.
     •    Your bank may ask you to complete additional paperwork before they can release our payment to you. This may delay your
          receipt of the payment and is outside our control.
     •    Whenever coverage provided by any Takaful cover policy is in violation of any US, UN or EU economic or trade sanctions,
          such coverage shall be null and void. For example, Aetna companies cannot pay for health care services provided in a
          country under sanction by the United States unless permitted under a written Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
          license. Learn more on the US Treasury’s website at: www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions
     •    We will process the claim if the invoices and receipts for the treatment costs incurred contain all of the following:
          - diagnosis of the medical condition treated
          - treatment date
          - type of treatment, and
