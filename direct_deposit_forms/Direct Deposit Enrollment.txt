     General Instructions: (1) Fill out and sign this form, (2) Attach a voided check or documentation letter from your bank
     verifying the account number for each checking account (not a deposit slip), and (3) Return this form to the Payroll Department.
     If you want to deposit into a savings account, have your bank provide you with the account number and the routing and
     transit number (it usually is not the number on a deposit slip). See example at bottom.

       Important! Employees, please read and sign the following before you complete and submit your account information.

      The undersigned hereby authorizes the Town of Windham Board of Education ("Employer") to deposit any sums Employer
     owes to me into the bank or other financial institution (“Financial Institution”) accounts identified below. The undersigned also
     authorizes Financial Institution to receive and accept any such deposits and credit the same to my account. If any deposit is made
     to my account in error by Employer, Financial Institution is authorized to return the erroneous payment to Employer and to debit
     my account for the same in an amount not to exceed the amount of the erroneous deposit. This authorization shall remain in
     effect until revoked by the undersigned in writing so as to allow Employer and Financial Institution a reasonable opportunity to
     act.
