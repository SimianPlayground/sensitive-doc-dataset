                                               STATEMENTS REQUIRED BY LAWS AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS

To comply with legislation passed by the Congress and Executive Orders issued by the President, Federal executive agencies,
including the Small Business Administration (SBA), must notify you of certain information. You can find the regulations and
policies implementing these laws and Executive Orders in Title 13, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter 1, or our
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). In order to provide the required notices, the following is a brief summary of the various
laws and Executive Orders that affect SBA's Disaster Loan Programs. A glossary of terms can be found at Disasterloan.sba.gov.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (5 U.S.C. § 552)

This law provides, with some exceptions, that we must make records or portions of records contained in our files available to
persons requesting them. This generally includes aggregate statistical information on our disaster loan programs and other
information such as names of borrowers (and their officers, directors, stockholders or partners), loan amounts at maturity, the
collateral pledged, and the general purpose of loans. We do not routinely make available to third parties your proprietary data
without first notifying you, required by Executive Order 12600, or information that would cause competitive harm or
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests must describe the specific records you want. For information about the FOIA, contact the
Chief, FOI/PA Office, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 5900, Washington, DC 20416, or by e-mail at foia@sba.gov.

PRIVACY ACT (5 U.S.C. § 552a)

Anyone can request to see or get copies of any personal information that we have in your file. Any personal information in your
file that is retrieved by individual identifiers, such as name or social security number is protected by the Privacy Act, which means
requests for information about you may be denied unless we have your written permission to release the information to the requestor
or unless the information is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The Agreements and Certifications section of
this form contains written permission for us to disclose the information resulting from this collection to state, local or private disaster
relief services.

The Privacy Act authorizes SBA to make certain "routine uses" of information protected by that Act. One such routine use for SBA's
loan system of records is that when this information indicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil, criminal,
or administrative in nature, SBA may refer it to the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local or foreign, charged with
responsibility for or otherwise involved in investigation, prosecution, enforcement or prevention of such violations. Another routine
use of personal information is to assist in obtaining credit bureau reports, on the Disaster Loan Applicants and guarantors for purposes
of originating, servicing, and liquidating Disaster loans. See, 69 F.R. 58598, 58617 (and as amended from time to time) for additional
background and other routine uses.

 Under the provisions of the Privacy Act, you are not required to provide social security numbers. (But see the information under
 Debt Collection Act below) We use social security numbers to distinguish between people with a similar or the same name for
 credit decisions and for debt collection purposes. Failure to provide this number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to
 which you are entitled by law, but having the number makes it easier for us to more accurately identify to whom adverse credit
 information applies and to keep accurate loan records.

 Note: Any person concerned with the collection, use and disclosure of information, under the Privacy Act may contact the Chief, FOI/
 PA Office, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 5900, Washington, DC 20416 or by e-mail at foia@sba.gov for information about the Agency's
 procedures relating to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act.


DEBT COLLECTION ACT OF 1982; DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT OF 1984; DEBT COLLECTION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF
1996 & other titles (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.)
These laws require us to aggressively collect any delinquent loan payments and to require you to give your taxpayer identification number
to us when you apply for a loan. If you receive a loan and do not make payments when they become due, we may take one or more of the
following actions (this list may not be exhaustive):

            *Report the delinquency to credit reporting bureaus.
            *Offset your income tax refunds or other amounts due to you from the Federal Government.
            *Refer the account to a private collection agency or other agency operating a debt collection center.
            *Suspend or debar you from doing business with the Federal Government.
            *Refer your loan to the Department of Justice.
            *Foreclose on collateral or take other actions permitted in the loan instruments.
            *Garnish wages.
            *Sell the debt.
            *Litigate or foreclose.

 RIGHT TO FINANCIAL PRIVACY ACT OF 1978 (12 U.S.C. § 3401 et seq.)

This notifies you, as required by the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (Act), of our right to access financial records held by financial
institutions that were or are doing business with you or your business. This includes financial institutions participating in loans or loan
guarantees.

The law provides that we may access your financial records when considering or administering Government loan or loan guaranty assistance
to you. We must give a financial institution a certificate of our compliance with the Act when we first request access to your financial records.
No other certification is required for later access. Our access rights continue for the term of any approved loan or loan guaranty. We do not
have to give you any additional notice of our access rights during the term of the loan or loan guaranty.

We may transfer to another Government authority any financial records included in a loan application or about an approved loan or loan
guaranty as necessary to process, service, liquidate, or foreclose a loan or loan guaranty. We will not permit any transfer of your financial
records to another Government authority except as required or permitted by law.

Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35)

We are collecting the information on this form in order to make disaster loans available to qualified small businesses. The form is
designed to collect the information necessary for us to make eligibility and credit decisions in order to fund or deny loan requests.
We will also use the information collected on this form to produce summary reports for program and management analysis, as
required by law.

PLEASE NOTE: The estimated burden for completing this form is 2 hours. Your responses to the requested information are required
in order to obtain a benefit under SBA's Disaster Business Loan Programs. However, you are not required to respond to any
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB approval number. If you have any questions or comments concerning
any aspects of this information collection, please contact the U.S. Small Business Administration Information Branch, 409 3 rd St., SW,
Washington, DC 20416 and Desk Officer for SBA, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
725 17th St., NW, Washington, DC 20503. (3245-0017) PLEASE DO NOT SEND FORMS TO OMB.

Policy Concerning Representatives and Their Fees

When you apply for an SBA loan, you may use an attorney, accountant, engineer, appraiser or other representative to help
prepare and present the application to us. You are not required to have representation. If an application is approved, you may
need an attorney to help prepare closing documents.

There are no "authorized representatives" of SBA, other than our regular salaried employees. Payment of a fee or gratuity to our
employees is illegal and will subject those involved to prosecution.

SBA Regulations prohibit representatives from proposing or charging any fee for services performed in connection with your
loan unless we consider the services necessary and the amount reasonable. The Regulations also prohibit charging you any
commitment, bonus, broker, commission, referral or similar fee. We will not approve the payment of any bonus, brokerage fee or
commission. Also, we will not approve placement or finder's fees for using or trying to use influence in the SBA loan
application process.

Fees to representatives must be reasonable for services provided in connection with the application or the closing and based upon
the time and effort required, the qualifications of the representative, and the nature and extent of work performed.
Representatives must execute a compensation agreement.

In the appropriate section of the application, you must state the names of everyone employed by you or on your behalf. You
must also notify the SBA disaster office in writing of the names and fees of any representative you employ after you file your
application.

If you have any questions concerning payment of fees or reasonableness of fees, contact the Field Office where you filed or will
file your application.

Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 3651 et seq.)

This legislation authorizes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the Department of Labor to require
businesses to modify facilities and procedures to protect employees when appropriate. If your business does not do so, you may
be penalized, forced to close or prevented from starting operations in a new facility. Because of this, we may require information
from you to determine whether your business complies with OSHA regulations and may continue operating after the loan is
approved or disbursed. You must certify to us that OSHA requirements applying to your business have been determined and that
you are, to the best of your knowledge, in compliance.

                         FEE DISCLOSURE FORM AND COMPENSATION AGREEMENT
                        For Agent Services In Connection With an SBA Disaster Assistance Loan

       POLICIES AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR FEES

     Purpose of this form: Section 13 of the Small Business Act requires that an SBA disaster loan applicant
     (“Applicant”) identify the names of persons engaged by or on behalf of the Applicant for the purpose of
     expediting the application and the fees paid or to be paid to any such person. 13 C.F.R., Part 103.5 requires any
     agent or packager to execute and provide to SBA a compensation agreement (“Agreement”). SOP 50-30,
     Appendix 14 defines how the reasonableness of fees may be determined. Each Agreement governs the
     compensation charged for services rendered or to be rendered to the Applicant in any matter involving SBA
     assistance. “Agent” includes a loan packager, accountant, attorney, consultant, engineer, architect, appraiser, or
     any other party that receives compensation from representing an Applicant for an SBA disaster loan.

     SBA does not require an Applicant to engage the services of any Agent to file an application or close a loan. No
     fees or compensation will be reimbursed or paid by SBA to any Agent. If an Applicant chooses to employ an
     Agent, the compensation an Agent charges to and that is paid by the Applicant must bear a necessary and
     reasonable relationship to the services actually performed and must be comparable to those charged by other
     Agents in the geographical area. Compensation cannot be contingent on loan approval. In addition,
     compensation must not include any expenses which are deemed by SBA to be unreasonable for services actually
     performed or expenses actually incurred. Compensation must not include charges prohibited in 13 CFR 103 or
     SOP 50-30, Appendix 14. If the compensation is determined by SBA to be unreasonable, the Agent must cancel
     the compensation, or refund to the Applicant any portion the Applicant already paid. In cases where SBA deems
     the amount of compensation unreasonable, the Agent must reduce the compensation to an amount SBA deems
     reasonable, refund to the Applicant any sum in excess of the amount SBA deems reasonable, and refrain from
     charging or collecting directly or indirectly from the Applicant an amount in excess of the amount SBA deems
     reasonable. Violation by an Agent of any of these rules may result in SBA’s suspension or revocation of the
     Agent’s privilege of conducting business with SBA.

     The following are not considered Agents for purposes of this Agreement and, therefore, are not required to
     complete this Agreement: 1) Applicant’s accountant for the preparation of financial statements or tax returns
     required by the Applicant in the normal course of business and not related to the loan application; 2) Any
     professional retained by Applicant for services required by the Applicant in the normal course of business and not
     related to the application or loan closing. Direct costs associated with document preparation in connection with
     the loan closing do not need to be reported in this Agreement.

     Instructions on completion of this form: This form must be completed in connection with a loan application if
     the Applicant has paid (or will be paying) compensation to an Agent in excess of the following amounts:
                                           $500 for a disaster home loan
                                           $2500 for a disaster business loan
     If the compensation exceeds these amounts, the Agent must provide an itemization and justification of the
     services performed.

     There must be a completed Agreement for each Agent compensated by the Applicant. If the certifications are
     made by a legal entity other than an individual (e.g., corporation, limited liability company), execution of the
     certification must be in the legal entity’s name by a duly authorized officer or other representative of the entity; if
     by a partnership, execution of the certification must be in the partnership’s name by a general partner.


PLEASE NOTE: The estimated burden for completion of this Form 159D is 5 minutes per response. You are not required to respond to this information collection
unless it displays a currently valid OMB approval number. Comments on the burden should be sent to U.S. Small Business Administration, Chief, Administrative
Information Branch, Washington, D.C. 20416, and Desk Officer for SBA, Office of Management and Budget, New Exec. Office Building, Room 10202, Washington,

                             STATEMENTS REQUIRED BY LAW AND EXECUTIVE ORDER
SBA is required to withhold or limit financial assistance, to impose special conditions on approved loans, to provide special
notices to applicants or borrowers and to require special reports and data from borrowers in order to comply with legislation
passed by the Congress and Executive Orders issued by the President and by the provisions of various inter-agency agreements.
SBA has issued regulations and procedures that implement these laws and executive orders. These are contained in Parts 112,
113, and 117 of Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations and in Standard Operating Procedures.

Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a)
Any person can request to see or get copies of any personal information that SBA has in his or her file when that file is retrieved
by individual identifiers such as name or social security numbers. Requests for information about another party may be denied
unless SBA has the written permission of the individual to release the information to the requestor or unless the information is
subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

Under the provisions of the Privacy Act, you are not required to provide your social security number. Failure to provide your
social security number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to which you are entitled. Disclosures of name and other
personal identifiers are, however, required for a benefit, as SBA requires an individual seeking assistance from SBA to provide it
with sufficient information for it to make a character determination. In determining whether an individual is of good character,
SBA considers the person’s integrity, candor, and disposition toward criminal actions. Additionally, SBA is specifically
authorized to verify your criminal history, or lack thereof, pursuant to section 7(a)(1)(B), 15 USC Section 636(a)(1)(B) of the
Small Business Act ( the Act). Further, for all forms of assistance, SBA is authorized to make all investigations necessary to
ensure that a person has not engaged in acts that violate or will violate the Act or the Small Business Investment Act, 15 USC
Sections 634(b)(11) and 687(b)(a), respectively. For these purposes, you are asked to voluntarily provide your social security
number to assist SBA in making a character determination and to distinguish you from other individuals with the same or similar
name or other personal identifier.

The Privacy Act authorizes SBA to make certain “routine uses” of information protected by that Act. One such routine use is the
disclosure of information maintained in SBA’s investigative files system of records when this information indicates a violation
or potential violation of law, whether civil, criminal, or administrative in nature. Specifically, SBA may refer the information to
the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local or foreign, charged with responsibility for, or otherwise involved in
investigation, prosecution, enforcement or prevention of such violations. Another routine use is disclosure to other Federal
agencies conducting background checks; only to the extent the information is relevant to the requesting agencies' function. See,
74 F.R. 14890 (2009), and as amended from time to time for additional background and other routine uses.

Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3401) -- This is notice to you as required by the Right to Financial Privacy
Act of 1978, of SBA's access rights to financial records held by financial institutions that are or have been doing business with
you or your business, including any financial institutions participating in a loan or loan guaranty. The law provides that SBA
shall have a right of access to your financial records in connection with its consideration or administration of assistance to you in
the form of a Government guaranteed loan. SBA is required to provide a certificate of its compliance with the Act to a financial
institution in connection with its first request for access to your financial records, after which no further certification is required
for subsequent accesses. The law also provides that SBA's access rights continue for the term of any approved loan guaranty
agreement. No further notice to you of SBA's access rights is required during the term of any such agreement. The law also
authorizes SBA to transfer to another Government authority any financial records included in a application for a loan,
or concerning an approved loan or loan guarantee, as necessary to process, service or foreclose on a loan guaranty or collect on a
defaulted loan guaranty.

Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552)
This law provides, with some exceptions, that SBA must supply information reflected in agency files and records to a person
requesting it. Information about approved loans that will be automatically released includes, among other things, statistics on
our loan programs (individual borrowers are not identified in the statistics) and other information such as the names of the
borrowers (and their officers, directors, stockholders or partners), the collateral pledged to secure the loan, the amount of the
loan, its purpose in general terms and the maturity. Proprietary data on a borrower would not routinely be made available to third
parties. All requests under this Act are to be addressed to the nearest SBA office and be identified as a Freedom of Information
request.

Executive Order 12549, Debarment and Suspension (2 CFR 2700)
1. The prospective borrower certifies, by submission of its loan application, that neither it nor its principals are
   presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this
   transaction by any Federal department or agency.
2. Where the borrower is unable to certify to any of the statements in this certification, such shall attach an explanation to
   the application.

Caution: If the tax transcript is being mailed to a third party, ensure that you have filled in lines 6 through 9 before signing. Sign and date the form once you have

control over what the third party does with the information. If you would like to limit the third party’s authority to disclose your transcript information, you can
specify this limitation in your written agreement with the third party.
