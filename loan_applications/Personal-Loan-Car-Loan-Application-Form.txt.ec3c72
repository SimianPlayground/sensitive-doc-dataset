    Step 1.4 Tax status

Tax Residency rules differ by country. Whether you are a tax resident of a particular country is often (but not always) based on the amount of time you
spend in a country, the location of your residence or place of work. For the US, tax residency can be as a result of citizenship or residency.
If you have any questions on how to define your tax residency status, please visit the OECD website (oecd.org) or speak to a professional tax adviser as we
are not allowed to give tax advice.
Answer both tax residency questions:
Are you a tax resident of Australia?                         Yes           No

Are you a tax resident of another Country?                   Yes           No

If you are a tax resident of a country other than Australia, provide your Tax Identification Number (TIN) or equivalent below. If you are a tax resident
of more than one country, list all relevant countries below.

     1     Country                                                   TIN                                                    If no TIN, list reason A, B, or C

     2     Country                                                   TIN                                                    If no TIN, list reason A, B, or C

     3     Country                                                   TIN                                                    If no TIN, list reason A, B, or C


Reason A The country of tax residency does not issue TINs to tax residents
Reason B You have not been issued with a TIN.
             Please explain why.
Reason C The country of tax residency does not require the TIN to be disclosed
If you are a tax resident of more countries, please cross this box     re-print this page and provide the additional details.
