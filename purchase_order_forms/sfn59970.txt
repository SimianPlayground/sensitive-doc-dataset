                                                        INSTRUCTIONS

 1. If the agency already has a buyer set up, OMB will use that person's name and settings. Otherwise, a Vendor Registry
    staff member will set themselves up as a buyer for this situation.

 2. If no one from the agency currently has the security to approve Purchase Orders, the following roles need to be requested
    from SFN 54418 at http://www.nd.gov/eforms/Doc/sfn54418.pdf. Vendor Registry can submit the form, but someone from
    the requesting agency will have to approve and sign the form.
     a.   NDS_ALL_PO_APPVR
     b.   NDS_WF_ALL_PO_APPRV_1000
     c.   NDS_WF_ALL_PO_APPRV_2500
     d.   NDS_WF_ALL_PO_APPRV_5000
     e.   NDS_WF_ALL_PO_APPRV_UNLIMITED

 3. If more than two items are being purchased, please include a description, quantity, price, and special instructions for each
    on an attached sheet. This attachment can be a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or price quote. It is important to
    include the complete accounting chartfield information for each item, if different.

 4. Save the completed pdf form to your agency's network drive. Then attach it to a Non-Vendor work request at
    https://secure.apps.nd.gov/omb/vr/vwrs/login.htm

 5. Vendor Registry will enter the Purchase Order and enter it into PeopleSoft workflow. The designated approver should see
    it appear on their worklist for final approval. When this has been done successfully, let Vendor Registry know so they can
    “dispatch” the Purchase Order. This process converts the purchase order into a pdf format that can then be printed or
    emailed to the vendor, along with any supporting documents.

 6. When the time comes to pay the bill for the items on this purchase order, the agency must contact Vendor Registry again
    to learn how to enter a Purchase Order voucher. A p-card or regular voucher can be used, but Vendor Registry needs to
    be informed of this so they can close the Purcahse Order after payment.

Vendor Registry can be reached at (701)328-2773. Their fax number is (701)328-0108.
