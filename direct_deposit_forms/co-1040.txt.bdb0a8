AGREEMENT

                                                  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY
I HEREBY AUTHORIZE THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT (“STATE”) TO ELECTRONICALLY DEPOSIT MY NET SALARY TO THE BANK ACCOUNT(S) NAMED ABOVE. THIS
AUTHORIZATION IS TO REMAIN IN FORCE UNTIL THE STATE HAS RECEIVED WRITTEN NOTIFICATION FROM ME OF ITS TERMINATION IN SUCH TIME AND MANNER
AS TO AFFORD THE STATE, AND THE BANK(S) NAMED ABOVE, A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO ACT UPON IT. IN THE EVENT THAT THE STATE NOTIFIES THE
BANK(S) THAT FUNDS WHICH I DID NOT EARN HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED TO MY ACCOUNT (S) IN ERROR, I HEREBY AUTHORIZE AND DIRECT THE BANK(S) TO
RETURN SAID FUNDS TO THE STATE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IN THE EVENT SUCH UNEARNED FUNDS HAVE BEEN DRAWN FROM THE ACCOUNT(S) SO THAT
RETURN OF THOSE FUNDS BY THE BANK(S) TO THE STATE IS NOT POSSIBLE, I HEREBY AUTHORIZE THE STATE TO RECOVER THOSE FUNDS BY DEDUCTING THE
AMOUNT OF SAID UNEARNED FUNDS FROM ANY FUTURE SALARY PAYMENTS FROM THE STATE UNTIL THE AMOUNT OF THE UNEARNED DEPOSIT(S) HAS BEEN
RECOVERED IN FULL. IN THE EVENT MY EMPLOYMENT WITH THE STATE IS TERMINATED FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER, AND IF AT THE TIME OF SUCH
TERMINATION I HAVE HAD UNEARNED PAY AUTOMATICALLY DEPOSITED IN MY CHECKING/SAVINGS ACCOUNT(S), I WILL IMMEDIATELY REPAY THE STATE THE
FULL AMOUNT OF SUCH UNEARNED PAY. I FURTHER AGREE THAT IF I DO NOT IMMEDIATELY REPAY SUCH UNEARNED PAY, I WILL BE PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR
ALL COSTS OF COLLECTION, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY’S FEES INCURRED BY THE STATE IN THE COLLECTION OF SUCH UNEARNED PAY, TOGETHER
WITH THE MAXIMUM INTEREST PERMITTED BY LAW.

I HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO THE ABOVE AGREEMENT.
