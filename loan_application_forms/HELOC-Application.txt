                             Home Equity Line of Credit FAQ’s


Definition: Sometimes referred to as a HELOC, a home equity line of credit lets you borrow
against the equity you've built in your home, by taking draws against your available balance.

What is the maximum time that a HELOC loan can be financed for?
The Home Equity line of Credit can be financed for a maximum of 15 years.

How is the interest rate determined?
Interest rates for HELOC loans are variable. Currently, the Credit Union sets HELOC interest
rates by adding .75% to the Prime interest rate with a floor of 4.75%

How long does the process take to finalize a HELOC loan?
Certain time restrictions are mandated by Texas Law and can not be shortened. The applicant
must wait a minimum of 12 calendar days prior to the closing date, then an additional 3 business
days must pass before funds can be distributed. Therefore, the minimum closing time of this loan
is 17 calendar days. However, the loan could take longer due to reasons outside the norm. (e.g.,
the timing of receipt of signed documents, legal disposition of the property, unpaid taxes,
unreleased lien, timing of formal appraisal or title commitment)

Is a spouse required to be on the loan?
Texas is a community property state, therefore, a spouse and anyone who is listed on the deed of
trust is required to be a joint applicant and must occupy the property.

Can a home owner have more than one HELOC loan?
Texas Law allows an owner only one HELOC loan at a time, regardless of the aggregate total of
outstanding debt against the homestead.

Does the property have to be homestead exempt?
Property used to secure a Texas HELOC must be the borrower's homestead.

What are the closing costs associated with a HELOC loan?
The standard cost for closing a HELOC is $203.00-$217.00. Per State law, all fees associated
with this loan cannot exceed 3% of the original principle loan amount.

The break-down of these fees are as follows:
   Property report $140.00.
   Flood certification $15.00.
   Recording fees $48.00 to $62.00.
   Appraisal
      Most often we use the tax appraisal (no cost).However, if a formal appraisal is required
      the cost ranges from $400.00- $500.00.
   Title commitment fees (determined by the title company)

How much can be borrowed for a HELOC loan?
The amount borrowed for a HELOC is 50% of the appraised market value minus any existing
liens on the property. For example, on a property with a fair market value of $100,000, the
maximum amount of debt against the property permitted by is $50,000. Assuming there is an
existing debt of $30,000, the maximum amount of the HELOC can be is $20,000.
Can an existing appraisal be used to determine property value?
At the discretion of the Credit Union, an existing appraisal may be used, granted it is no older
than one year and was prepared for another lender.

Is there a prepayment penalty on a HELOC loan?
A lender may not charge a penalty to a borrower for paying all or a portion of an equity loan
early.

How long may you access the Line of Credit?
Per regulation the draw period cannot exceed 5 years.

                                          HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT
If you are in the market for credit, a home equity plan is one of several options that might be right for you. Before making
a decision, however, you should weigh carefully the costs of a home equity line against the benefits. Shop for the credit
terms that best meet your borrowing needs without posing undue financial risks. And remember, failure to repay the
amounts you've borrowed, plus interest, could mean the loss of your home.

WHAT IS A HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT?
A home equity line is a form of revolving credit in which your home serves as collateral. Because the home often is a
consumer's most valuable asset, many homeowners use home equity credit lines only for major items such as education,
home improvements, or medical bills and choose not to use them for day-to-day expenses.

With a home equity line, you will be approved for a specific amount of credit.

Many lenders set the credit limit on a home equity line by taking a percentage (say, 75%)
                                                                                     50% of the home's appraised value
and subtracting from that the balance owed on the existing mortgage. For example:


                                Appraised value of home                          $100,000
                                Percentage                                              50%
                                                                                     x75%
                                Percentage of appraised value                    =$75,000
                                                                                    50
                                Less balance owed on mortgage                    - $40,000
                                                                                    10
                               Potential line of credit                              40
                                                                                    $35,000

In determining your actual credit limit, the lender will also consider your ability to repay the loan (principal and interest) by
looking at your income, debts, and other financial obligations as well as your credit history.

Many home equity plans set a fixed period during which you can borrow money, such as 10 years. At the end of this
"draw period," you may be allowed to renew the credit line. If your plan does not allow renewals, you will not be able to
borrow additional money once the period has ended. Some plans may call for payment in full of any outstanding balance at
the end of the period. Others may allow repayment over a fixed period (the "repayment period"), for example, 10 years.

Once approved for a home equity line of credit, you will most likely be able to borrow up to your credit limit whenever you
want. Typically, you will use special checks to draw on your line. Under some plans, borrowers can use a credit card or
other means to draw on the line.

There may be other limitations on how you use the line. Some plans may require you to borrow a minimum amount each
time you draw on the line (for example, $300) and to keep a minimum amount outstanding. Some plans may also require
that you take an initial advance when the line is set up.

What should you look for when shopping for a plan?
If you decide to apply for a home equity line of credit, look for the plan that best meets your particular needs. Read the
credit agreement carefully, and examine the terms and conditions of various plans, including the annual percentage rate
(APR) and the costs of establishing the plan. Remember, though, that the APR for a home equity line is based on the
interest rate alone and will not reflect closing costs and other fees and charges, so you'll need to compare these costs, as
well as the APRs, among lenders.

Variable interest rates

Home equity lines of credit typically involve variable rather than fixed interest rates. The variable rate must be based on a
publicly available index (such as the prime rate published in some major daily newspapers or a U.S. Treasury bill rate). In
such cases, the interest rate you pay for the line of credit will change, mirroring changes in the value of the index. Most
lenders cite the interest rate you will pay as the value of the index at a particular time, plus a "margin," such as 2
percentage points. Because the cost of borrowing is tied directly to the value of the index, it is important to find out which
index is used, how often the value of the index changes, and how high it has risen in the past. It is also important to note
the amount of the margin.




                                                                                                                           LES494
Lenders sometimes offer a temporarily discounted interest rate for home equity lines -- an "introductory" rate that is
unusually low for a short period, such as 6 months. Variable-rate plans secured by a dwelling must, by law, have a
ceiling (or cap) on how much your interest rate may increase over the life of the plan. Some variable-rate plans limit how
much your payment may increase and how low your interest rate may fall if index drops. Some lenders allow you to
convert from a variable interest rate to a fixed rate during the life of the plan, or to convert all or a portion of your line to a
fixed-term installment loan.

Costs of establishing and maintaining a home equity line
Many of the costs of setting up a home equity line of credit are similar to those you pay when you get a mortgage. For
example,

    A fee for a property appraisal to estimate the value of your home;

    An application fee, which may not be refunded if you are turned down for credit;

    Up-front charges, such as one or more "points" (one point equals 1 percent of the credit limit); and

    Closing costs, including fees for attorneys, title search, mortgage preparation and filing, property and title insurance,
    and taxes.

In addition, you may be subject to certain fees during the plan period, such as annual membership or maintenance fees
and a transaction fee every time you draw on the credit line.

You could find yourself paying hundreds of dollars to establish the plan. And if you were to draw only a small amount
against your credit line, those initial charges would substantially increase the cost of the funds borrowed. On the other
hand, because the lender's risk is lower than for other forms of credit, as your home serves as collateral, annual
percentage rates for home equity lines are generally lower than rates for other types of credit. The interest you save could
offset the costs of establishing and maintaining the line. Moreover, some lenders waive some or all of the closing costs.

How will you repay your home equity plan?
Before entering into a plan, consider how you will pay back the money you borrow. Some plans set a monthly payment
that includes a portion of the principal (the amount you borrow) plus accrued interest. But unlike with typical installment
loan agreements, the portion of your payment that goes toward principal may not be enough to repay the principal by the
end of the term. Other plans may allow payment of interest only during the life of the plan, which means that you pay
nothing toward the principal. If you borrow $10,000, you will owe that amount when the plan ends.

Regardless of the minimum required payment on your home equity line, you may choose to pay more, and many lenders
offer a choice of payment options. Many consumers choose to pay down the principal regularly as they do with other
loans. For example, if you use your line to buy a boat, you may want to pay it off as you would a typical boat loan.

Whatever your payment arrangements during the life of the plan -- whether you pay some, a little, or none of the principal
amount of the loan -- when the plan ends, you may have to pay the entire balance owed, all at once. You must be
prepared to make this "balloon payment" by refinancing it with the lender, by obtaining a loan from another lender, or by
some other means. If you are unable to make the balloon payment, you could lose your home.

If your plan has a variable interest rate, your monthly payments may change. Assume, for example, that you borrow
$10,000 under a plan that calls for interest-only payments. At a 10% interest rate, your monthly payments would be $83.
If the rate rises over time to 15%, your monthly payments will increase to $125. Similarly, if you are making payments
that cover interest plus some portion of the principal, your monthly payments may increase, unless your agreement calls
for keeping payments the same throughout the plan period.

If you sell your home, you will probably be required to pay off your home equity line in full immediately. If you are likely to
sell your home in the near future, consider whether it makes sense to pay the up-front costs of setting up a line of credit.
Also keep in mind that renting your home may be prohibited under the terms of your agreement.

Lines of credit vs. traditional second mortgage loans
If you are thinking about a home equity line of credit, you might also want to consider a traditional second mortgage loan.
This type of loan provides you with a fixed amount of money, repayable over a fixed period. In most cases, the payment
schedule calls for equal payments that pay off the entire loan within the loan period. You might consider a second
mortgage instead of a home equity line if, for example, you need a set amount for a specific purpose, such as an addition
to your home.


                                                                                                                             LES494
In deciding which type of loan best suits your needs, consider the costs under the two alternatives. Look at both the APR
and other charges. Do not, however, simply compare the APRs, because the APRs on the two types of loans are figured
differently:

   The APR for a traditional second mortgage loan takes into account the interest rate charged plus points and other
   finance charges.

   The APR for a home equity line of credit is based on the periodic interest rate alone. It does not include points or other
   charges.

Disclosures from Lenders

The federal Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to disclose the important terms and costs of their home equity plans,
including the APR, miscellaneous charges, the payment terms, and information about any variable-rate feature. And in
general, neither the lender nor anyone else may charge a fee until after you have received this information. You usually get
these disclosures when you receive an application form, and you will get additional disclosures before the plan is opened.
If any term (other than a variable-rate feature) changes before the plan is opened, the lender must return all fees if you
decide not to enter into the plan because of the change.

When you open a home equity line, the transaction puts your home at risk. If the home involved is your principal dwelling,
the Truth in Lending Act gives you 3 days from the day the account was opened to cancel the credit line. This right allows
you to change your mind for any reason. You simply inform the lender in writing within the 3-day period. The lender must
then cancel its security interest in your home and return all fees -- including any application and appraisal fees -- paid to
open the account.

What if the lender freezes or reduces your line of credit?
Plans generally permit lenders to freeze or reduce a credit line if the value of the home "declines significantly" or, when
the lender "reasonably believes" that you will be unable to make your payments due to a "material change" in your
financial circumstances. If this happens, you may want to:

    Talk with your lender. Find out what caused the lender to freeze or reduce your credit line and what, if anything,
    you can do to restore it. You may be able to provide additional information to restore your line of credit, such as
    documentation showing that your house has retained its value or that there has not been a "material change" in your
    financial circumstances. You may want to get copies of your credit reports (go to Federal Trade Commission's
    website, at www.ftc.gov//freereports, for information about free copies) to make sure all the information in them is
    correct. If your lender suggests getting a new appraisal, be sure you discuss appraisal firms in advance so that you
    know they will accept the new appraisal as valid.

    Shop around for another line of credit. If your lender does not want to restore your line of credit, shop around to see
    what other lenders have to offer. You may be able to pay off your original line of credit and take out another one.
    Keep in mind, however, that you may need to pay some of the same application fees you paid for your original line of
    credit.
GLOSSARY
Annual membership or maintenance fee - An annual charge for access to a financial product such as a line of credit, credit
card, or account. The fee is charged regardless of whether or not the product is used.

Annual percentage rate (APR) - The cost of credit, expressed as a yearly rate. For closed-end credit, such as car loans or
mortgages, the APR includes the interest rate, points, broker fees, and other credit charges that the borrower is required
to pay. An APR, or an equivalent rate, is not used in leasing agreements.

Application fee - Fees charged when you apply for a loan or other credit. These fees may include charges for property
appraisal and a credit report.

Balloon payment - A large extra payment that may be charged at the end of a mortgage loan or lease.

Cap (interest rate) - A limit on the amount that your interest rate can increase. Two types of interest-rate caps exist.
Periodic adjustment caps limit the interest-rate increase from one adjustment period to the next. Lifetime caps limit the
interest-rate increase over the life of the loan. By law, all adjustable-rate mortgages have an overall cap.

Closing or settlement costs - Fees paid when you close (or settle) on a loan. These fees may include application fees; title
examination, abstract of title, title insurance, and property survey fees; fees for preparing deeds, mortgages, and
settlement documents; attorneys' fees; recording fees; estimated costs of taxes and insurance; and notary, appraisal, and
credit report fees. Under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the borrower receives a good faith estimate of
closing costs within three days of application. The good faith estimate lists each expected cost as an amount or a range.
                                                                                                                       LES494
Credit limit - The maximum amount that may be borrowed on a credit card or under a home equity line of credit plan.

Equity - The difference between the fair market value of the home and the outstanding balance on your mortgage plus any
outstanding home equity loans.

Index - The economic indicator used to calculate interest-rate adjustments for adjustable-rate mortgages or other
adjustable-rate loans. The index rate can increase or decrease at any time. See also Selected Index Rates for ARMs over
an 11-year Period (www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/arms/arms_english.htm) for examples of common indexes that have
changed in the past.

Interest rate - The percentage rate used to determine the cost of borrowing money, stated usually as a percentage of the
principal loan amount and as an annual rate.

Margin - The number of percentage points the lender adds to the index rate to calculate the ARM interest rate at each
adjustment.

Minimum payment - The lowest amount that you must pay (usually monthly) to keep your account in good standing.
Under some plans, the minimum payment may cover interest only; under others, it may include both principal and interest.

Points (also called discount points) - One point is equal to 1 percent of the principal amount of a mortgage loan. For
example, if a mortgage is $200,000, one point equals $2,000. Lenders frequently charge points in both fixed-rate and
adjustable-rate mortgages to cover loan origination costs or to provide additional compensation to the lender or broker.
These points usually are paid at closing and may be paid by the borrower or the home seller, or may be split between
them. In some cases, the money needed to pay points can be borrower (incorporated in the loan amount), but doing so
will increase the loan amount and the total costs. Discount points (also called discount fees) are points that you
voluntarily choose to pay in return for a lower interest rate.

Security interest - If stated in your credit agreement, a creditor's lessor's, or assignee's legal right to your property (such
as your home, stocks, or bonds) that secures payment of your obligation under the credit agreement.

Transaction fee - Fee charged each time a withdrawal or other specified transaction is made on a line of credit, such as a
balance transfer fee or a cash advance fee.

Variable rate - An interest rate that changes periodically in relation to an index, such as the prime rate. Payments may
increase or decrease accordingly.
