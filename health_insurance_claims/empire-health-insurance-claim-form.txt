MEMBERS: You are required to complete this claim form if you receive services from a nonparticipating physi-
cian (any physician that is “out-of-network”).
1.    Complete the patient and insured information sections (Boxes 1–12).
      • Please make sure the three-letter alpha prefix, along with the insured’s member identification number,
          appears in Box 1a. Do not complete Box 13.
2.    Attach the original itemized bill from the physician to the claim form and mail it to the address listed on the front
      of the form.
      OR
      Have the physician complete the physician supplier information sections (Boxes 14–33). And mail it to the
      address listed on the front of the form.
NOTE: If you receive services from a participating physician (an “in-network” physician), you are not required to
complete any claim forms. All participating network physicians submit claims directly to their local Blue Cross and/or
Blue Shield plan.
If you have any questions about completing this claim form, please call the Customer Service telephone number
listed on the front of the form or the number on the back of your member identification card.
PROVIDERS: If you have rendered services to a member, please complete the physician supplier information sections
(Boxes 14–33). Then mail it to the address listed on the front of the form.

                                               PATIENT’S SIGNATURE

The patient must sign the claim form, authorizing the release of information to Empire or its designee as described
below. If the patient is a minor, the signature must be that of the patient’s parent or legal guardian.
I authorize any healthcare provider, payor of health claims or government agency to furnish to Empire or its designee
all records pertaining to medical history, services rendered, or payments made regarding me or my dependents for
review and evaluation of any claim or services.
I authorize Empire or its designee to disclose such information to another payor or self-insurer. If my coverage is under
a group contract held by an employer, association, trust fund, union or similar entity, this authorization also permits
disclosure to them for purposes of utilization review or financial audit.
This authorization shall become effective immediately, and shall remain in effect until the latest of six years after the
termination of coverage, or the last determination or payment by Empire on a claim or service under the coverage.
This authorization shall be binding upon me, my dependents, my heirs, executors or administrators.

                                                 FRAUD STATEMENT

Any person who knowingly and with intent to defraud any insurance company or other person files a statement of
claim containing any materially false information, or conceals, for the purpose of misleading, information concerning
any fact material thereto, may be guilty of a criminal act punishable under law and may be subject to civil penalties.
