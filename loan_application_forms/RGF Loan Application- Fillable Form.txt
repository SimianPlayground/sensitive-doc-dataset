                                                         RETURNABLE GRANT FUND
                                                            LOAN APPLICATION



The Returnable Grant Fund (RGF) is processed by the Fund for the City of New York (FCNY),
managed by the Mayor’s Office of Contract Services (MOCS), and loans are approved by the City
Agency you contract with.

Who Can Get a Loan?
To be eligible for an RGF loan, your organization must have an active contract pending registration, a
grant or another funding agreement. The contract or grant is the City’s guarantee and will be used to
repay the loan after registration.

The RGF was created to support organizations whose contracts have been delayed, which is
preventing timely payment, and are therefore unable to meet critical operating expenses.

How do I Apply?
Complete and submit the following to the City Agency you are contracting with, to the attention of the
Agency Chief Contracting Officer (ACCO):

    Complete Application [Part 1 & 2]
    Signed Written Repayment Agreement with City Agency [Part 3]
    Board Resolution naming the person who signs the application on Page 3 as an Authorized
     Signatory; or the signatory page of an executed contract

Visit nyc.gov/mocs for contact information for each agency’s ACCO.

What are the Next Steps?
Your contracting aagency may approve a loan by submitting the completed application to MOCS.
Agencies must sign Part 3, complete Part 4 and Part 5, and attach a responsibility determination, and
the approved budget. The completed package must be transmitted to MOCS by email with the
attachments that are required for the applicant listed above.

MOCS will review the application for completeness and may approve loans on the basis of need and
availability of funds. Loan requests may be approved at reduced amounts to ensure that critical needs
can be met for all applicants.

Questions may be directed to your contracting city agency or to MOCS at
returnablegrantfund@cityhall.nyc.gov.
