Generic Direct Deposit Authorization Form




This form may not be applicable to your employer. Check with your employer’s payroll
department to verify that direct deposit is available to you and whether a standard form is
already in use for enrollment. In lieu of a standard form, this completed form provides all the
information that most employers would require.

For your convenience, the Service 1st FCU routing number (ABA Number) is already included on
this form. Questions about your employer’s ability to direct deposit your paycheck should be
directed to your employer’s payroll department. Service 1st can readily accept direct deposit from
any employer via the ACH network.

This completed and signed form should be returned to your employer’s payroll department.

I authorize _______________________(Employer) to direct funds to my account at Service 1st
Federal Credit Union. If funds to which I am not entitled are deposited in my account, I authorize
my employer to initiate a correcting (debit) entry. I understand that the authorization may be
rejected or discontinued by the employer at any time. If any of the above information changes, I
will promptly complete a new authorization agreement. If the direct deposit is not stopped before
closing an account, funds payable to me will be returned to the employer for distribution. This
will delay my check.
