accumulate. A benefit year is often, but not always, January 1 through December 31. If you have any It Fits! reimbursement money left after you submit this form for
reimbursement (during the current benefit year), you may submit a new form for reimbursement.
**Reimbursement amounts may vary. Reimbursement is not available for camps that are not sports-dedicated,
social clubs, transportation, greens fees, uniforms, meals, lodging, fitness clothing, vitamins, gift cards and donations.
