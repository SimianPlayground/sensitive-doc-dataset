Notice to Offerors
This competitive sealed proposal is the intention of Montgomery ISD to provide General Supplies as
specified in this Request for Proposal. In order for a proposal to be considered all forms must be
completed and signed. Vendor's proposal and the completed forms must be received in the Purchasing
Office on or before the hour and date specified.

This agreement is subject to the appropriation of funds by the District in its budget adopted for any
fiscal year for the specific purpose of making payments pursuant to this Agreement. The obligations of
the District in any fiscal year for which this Agreement is in effect shall constitute a current expense of
the District for that fiscal year only, and shall not constitute an indebtedness of the District beyond that
fiscal year. In the event of non-appropriation of funds in any fiscal year to make payments pursuant to
this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated.

This notification should be supplied with appropriate documentation from the vendor supporting the
price increase(s). Increases in price shall not be automatically retroactive but will be evaluated if any
order is pending. Proposed price adjustment will not be accepted without prior approval from
Montgomery ISD. Invoices with price changes that did not received prior approval from Purchasing
will not be honored.
MISD intention is to enter into a contract which shall be effective September 1, 2019 through August
31, 2020. This contract maybe renewed for four (4) additional years on an annual basis, if the vendor
and the District mutually agree and no increase in costs has incurred.

Proposer should provide the best pricing if this reflects cooperative pricing, provide the name of the
cooperative.

Withdrawal of proposals will not be allowed for a period of 90 days following the proposal opening.
                                                                                                         4
MISD reserves the right to award multiple vendors. MISD will evaluate the proposals based on the
evaluation criteria to determine the best overall value for the district.

Collusion/Disqualification Statement:
Proposer may be disqualified before or after Montgomery ISD opens proposals upon evidence of
collusion with the intent to defraud, upon evidence of intent to perform other illegal activities for the
purpose of obtaining an unfair competitive advantage, upon evidence of debarment and suspension,
or upon indebtedness to the District. Non-Responsive Proposals and deviations/exceptions stipulated
in Proposer’s response may also result in disqualification.

Scope of Services:
MISD is seeking proposals for delivery of various products and office supplies, paper stock, media
materials, and other miscellaneous office products. The Successful bidder will provide an online order
system capable of identifying MISD employees, ship-to addresses, department names and locations, and
default credit card billing information. Bidder’s system will allow for chosen MISD personnel to be
assigned as system administrators to manage user-defined parameters above as well as manage and
monitor fixed contract pricing that results from this proposal. The successful bidder will guarantee free
next day delivery of office supplies to all MISD locations and pick-up any designated returns for return-
to-stock processing and account crediting.

Brand names:

References to brand names and/or numbers in the solicitation are intended to be restrictive, and not
merely descriptive, unless otherwise specified. If the specific product cannot be supplied by the bidder,
equivalent items meeting the standards of quality specified will be considered. Unless a bidder indicates
otherwise, it is understood that the proposer is offering the referenced brand item as specified in the
solicitation. MISD reserves the right to determine whether a substitute offer is equivalent to and meets the
standards of quality indicated by the brand name referenced, and MISD may require the supply of
additional descriptive material and a sample.

Samples:

Samples of goods may be required prior to award to determine bidder’s responsiveness to the RFP’s
requirements. If requested, such samples must be provided at no cost and delivered to the address
specified within the time-frame identified in the notification. Failure to submit samples as specified may
be grounds for rejection of a vendor’s proposal. Unless expressly set forth in the solicitation, the sample
of goods furnished must be identical in all respects to the product or products being offered. Bidders
offering products of a different manufacturer and model number than those specified in the solicitation
may be required to submit samples for inspection and specification compliance testing in order for MISD
to determine if the item offered is equivalent to and meets the minimum standards of quality acceptable to
MISD. Samples, if not destroyed by tests, may, upon request made by the bidder at the time the sample is
furnished, be returned at bidder’s expense.

Contract vs. Non-Contract Products:

Each of the MISD offices/departments may individually at their discretion, order office supplies,
including Contract Items and Non-Contract Items, by placing an individual order via a bidder’s online
ordering portal. The term “Contract Item” is defined as any item or replacement item (as agreed to by
MISD) that is included in Attachment A: Itemized Cost Proposal, or any resulting agreement that may
result from this RFP. The term “Non-Contract Item” is defined as any item that vendor is able to provide
that is not included with a specific price in Attachment A. The term “Contract pricing” is defined as the
price for a Contract Item that was bid in the vendor’s proposal and reflected in any final agreement that
results from this RFP.

Bidders shall demonstrate options for designating Contract items using visual identifiers (online) and/or
special MISD defined customer catalog product numbers, or other potential item flags.




                                                                                                             7
Contract Management:

Effective management of the initial core contract product list is crucial to the success of the vendor-
customer partnership. It is understood that over the course of the initial contract term, certain products
may be discontinued by the manufacturer, or undergo changes in design, color and packaging. The vendor
must describe the process used to effectively manage this change.

Products should be maintained at the same unit of measure originally bid. Any products that are
discontinued due to manufacturer “repackaging” must be added back to the contract at the equivalent
original bid pricing. Notification of products dropped from the contract must occur within 30 days of
product discontinuation.

The vendor is required to maintain a toll-free number for ordering, inquiries, and customer service in
addition to a 24-hour access website for order placement and delivery tracking. The vendor will provide
an immediate acknowledgment of confirmation following any request to place an order. The
acknowledgment will be submitted by email, regardless of what method is used to place the order. The
vendor shall describe its acknowledgment process.

Order Requirements:



             1.     Any replacement items are of equal or better quality

             2.     Buyer must be notified if an item is not available at the time the order is
                    placed and presented with an option of a replacement item or the back-
                    ordered item when it becomes available

             3.     Estimated delivery dates must be provided for all backordered items

             4.     If a back-ordered item is not available on the estimated delivery date, the
                    buyer placing the order must be notified prior to the estimated delivery
                    date and given the option of a replacement item or the back-ordered item
                    when it becomes available. If the buyer is not satisfied with the quality of
                    the replacement product, the buyer has the right to return the product. The
                    buyer will not incur any cost for return of the product, including but not
                    limited to shipping and handling.

supporting departments will be strongly encouraged to order against the General Office Supplies
RFP, but will not be required to purchase exclusively if vendor’s stocking levels are insufficient,
lead-times for back-ordered items are too long, or other special needs are warranted.

Employee Background Checks and Assurances
Effective January 1, 2008, an entity that contracts to provide services to the Montgomery I.S.D. must obtain
national criminal history information on all new or existing employees who:
1..   has, or will have continuing duties related to contracted services and
2..   has, or will have direct contact with students.

In compliance with Texas Senate Bill 9 (SB9), MISD will not allow entrance of an employee of a contractor
and/or the contractor providing services to the district if that employee has been convicted of a Title 5 felony
against a minor or student, or the employee is required to register as a sex offender because of an offense
against a minor or student. In an emergency, the contractor is required to seek permission from the district, and
if granted, MISD will allow an otherwise impermissible contractor employee to enter district property, so long
as the person is accompanied at all times by a district employee.

The law states that contractors must obtain criminal history information on any employee hired on or after 1
January 2008, before or immediately after the person is employed. It also requires that the contractor begin
reviewing the criminal history information on current employees employed before 1 January 2008 as soon as
practical.

Compliance with these requirements will not prohibit the district from obtaining independent information on a
contractor employee as permitted by this law.

Furthermore, nothing herein is meant to impart legal advice to the contractor on the laws or procedures
required by law. All contractors are urged to seek independent legal advice before signing the required
assurances under Texas SB9. If contract is awarded, the below information will be required.


                       Contractor Acknowledgment of Background Check Policy

I, _______________________________, acknowledge that I have read and understood the Employee
Background Checks and Assurances Policy for Montgomery I.S.D. I am currently in compliance with the
Requirements of this policy and will remain so for the duration of my contract with Montgomery I.S.D.

        1.. Contractor has obtained all required criminal history record information regarding its covered
        employees. None of the covered employees has a disqualifying criminal history.
        2. If Contractor receives information that a covered employee subsequently has a reported criminal
        history, Contractor will immediately remove the covered employee from contract duties and notify the
        District in writing within 3 business days.
        3.. Upon request, Contractor will provide the District with the name and any other requested
        information of covered employees so that the District may obtain criminal history record information
        on the covered employees.
        4. If the District objects to the assignment of a covered employee on the basis of the covered
        employee’s criminal history record information, Contractor agrees to discontinue using the covered
        employee to provide services at the District.

Noncompliance or misrepresentation regarding this certification may be grounds for contract termination.
                                                                                                     25
Felony Conviction Notification



State of Texas Legislative Senate Bill No. 1, Section 44.034, Notification of Criminal History, Subsection (a), states, “a
person or business entity that enters into a contract with a school district must give advance notice to the district if the
person or an owner or operator of the business entity has been convicted of a felony. The notice must include a general
description of the conduct resulting in the conviction of a felony”.

Subsection (b) states, “a school district may terminate a contract with a person or business entity if the district determines
that the person or business entity failed to give notice as required by Subsection (a) or misrepresented the conduct
resulting in the conviction. The district must compensate the person or business entity for services performed before the
termination of the contract”.

Conflict of Interest (Form CIQ)




                                  28
 Certificate of Interested Parties (Form 1295) Filing Instructions
Effective January 1, 2016, a governmental entity may not enter into a contract requiring
board approval, unless the business entity submits a Disclosure of Interested Parties (Form
1295) at the time the business entity submits the signed contract.

The following definitions apple:
   1. “Interested Party” means a person:
          a. Who has a controlling interest in a business entity with whom a governmental
              entity contracts: or
         b. Who actively participates in facilitating the contract or negotiating the terms of
              the contract, including a broker, intermediary, adviser, or attorney for the business
              entity.
   2. “Intermediary” means “a person who actively participates in the facilitation of the
      contract or negotiating the contract, including a broker, adviser, attorney, or
      representative of or agent for the business entity who:
          a. Receives compensation from the business entity for the person’s participation;
         b. Communicates directly with the governmental entity or state agency on behalf
              of the business entity regarding the contract; and
          c. Is not an employee of the business entity
   3. “Business Entity” means any entity recognized by law through which business is
      conducted, including a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. “Business
      entity” includes a for- profit or nonprofit entity. He term does not include a
      governmental entity or state agency.
   4. “Contract” includes an amended, extended, or renewed contract.
   5. “Controlling Interest” means:
          a. An ownership interest or participating interest in a business entity by virtue of
              units, percentage, shares, stock, or otherwise that exceeds 10 percent;
         b. Membership on the board of directors or other governing body of a business
              entity of which the board or other governing body is composed of not more than
              10 members; or
          c. Service as an officer of a business entity that has four or fewer officers, or service
              as one of the four officers most highly compensated by a business entity that has
              more than four officers.”


A business entity must file Form 1295 electronically with the Texas Ethics
Commission using the Commission’s online filing application, which can be found
at:              https://www.ethics.state.tx.us/whatsnew/elf_info_form1295.htm

The business entity must print a copy of the completed form, which will include a certification
of filing containing a unique certification number. The Form 1295 must be signed by an
authorized agent of the business entity, and the form must be notarized. The business
entity must then submit the completed, signed, notarized Form 1295 to the contracting
school district.

Again, inter-local contracts DO NOT REQUIRE a Form 1295 because governmental entities do
not fall within the definition of “business entity”. Notably, though, compliance with HB 1295
is required for contracts with nonprofit agencies, such as Montgomery Independent School
District.
                                                                                                  29
                       Certificate of Interested Parties (Form 1295)
Upon approval by the MISD Board of Trustees, the vendor will need to complete the Texas Ethics Certificate
of Interested Parties Form 1295 and send the notarized form to the MISD Purchasing department. For
information or filing this form can be found at www.ethics.state.tx.us/File . The identification number will be
this RFP# and title. Sample of form below.




                                                                                                    30
                      SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT CERTIFICATE

Non-Federal entities are prohibited from contracting with or making sub-awards under covered
transactions to parties that are suspended or debarred or whose principals are suspended or
debarred. Covered transactions include procurement for goods or services equal to, or in excess
of, $100,000.00. Contractors receiving individual awards for $100,000.00 or more and all sub-
recipients must certify that the organization and its principals are not suspended or debarred.

              By submitting this offer and signing this certificate, the proposer:

              •   Certifies the owner/operator has not been convicted of a felony except
                  as indicated on a separate attachment to this offer, in accordance with
                  Sec. 44.034 Texas Education Code, and
              •   Certifies that no suspension or disbarment is in place, which would
                  preclude receiving a federally funded contract under the Federal
                  OMB, A-102, Common Rule (Sec. 36)

business in Israel or in an Israeli-controlled territory. I certify that this company that is entering into a
contract with Montgomery ISD is not on the list of companies on the website of the Comptroller of the
State of Texas which do business with Iran, Sudan, or any Foreign Terrorist Organization, I will
immediately notify the Montgomery ISD Purchasing Department.

29. WARRANTY-PRODUCT: Contractor shall not limit or exclude any implied warranties and any attempt to do so shall render this
    contract voidable at the option of the District. Contractor warrants that the goods furnished will conform to the
    specifications, drawings and descriptions listed in the bid invitation, and to the sample(s) furnished by Contractor, if any. In
    the event of a conflict between the specifications, drawings and descriptions, the drawings and descriptions shall govern.
30. WARRANTY-SAFETY: Contractor warrants that the product sold to the District shall conform to the standards promulgated by
    the U.S. Department of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. In the event the product does not conform
    to OSHA standards, the District may return the product for correction or replacement at the Contractor's expense. In the event
    the Contractor fails to make the appropriate correction within reasonable time, correction made by the District will be at the
    Contractor's expense.
31. WARRANTY-INFRINGEMENT: As part of this contract for sale Contractor agrees to ascertain whether goods manufactured in
    accordance with the specifications attached to this contract will give rise to the rightful claim of any third person by way of
    infringement or the like. The District makes no warranty that the production of goods according to the specification will not
    give rise to such a claim and in no event shall the District be liable to the Contractor for indemnification in the event that Con-
    tractor is sued on the grounds of infringement or the like. If Contractor is of the opinion that an infringement or the like will
    result, he will notify the District to this effect in writing within two weeks after the signing of this contract. If the District does
    not receive notice and is subsequently held liable for the infringement or the like, the Contractor will hold the District harmless
    (if the Contractor in good faith ascertains that production of goods in accordance with the specifications will result in
    infringement or the like, this contract shall be null and void except that the District will pay the Contractor the reasonable cost
    of his search as to infringements).
32. REJECTION/AWARD: Montgomery ISD reserves the right to reject any and/or all submittals, to award contracts for individual
    items as may appear advantageous and to waive all formalities in bidding. Written notice of award mailed or otherwise
    furnished to the successful bidder results in a binding contract without further action by either party.
33. TERMINATION: The District reserves the right to terminate all or any part of the undelivered portion of any order resulting from this
    bid/proposal solicitation upon thirty (30) days written notice; upon default by the vendor, for delay or nonperformance by the
    vendor or, if it is deemed in the best interest of the District, for convenience. Any notice delivered to either party shall be deemed to
    be delivered when mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, and addressed to party’s
    address appearing in the request or response documents (or as subsequently revised or changed). Any compensation due to
    Contractor will be limited to services performed and accepted by Montgomery ISD up to the date of termination.
34. PUBLIC ACCESS: Montgomery ISD is a public entity subject to the provisions of the provisions of the Texas Public Information Act

    term “CONFIDENTIAL” or “PROPRIETARY” on every page of any part of the response that the firm claims is confidential or
    proprietary. All responses and parts of the response that are not marked as confidential or proprietary will be considered public
    information after the contract is awarded. The District assumes no liability or responsibility for release of any information not
    properly marked. In the event that the District receives a request for disclosure of material marked “confidential” or
    “proprietary”, the District may request an opinion from the Texas Attorney General concerning whether such material must be
    disclosed. Any complete response that is deemed Copyrighted is unacceptable and may be disqualified as non-responsive.

    respondents.
