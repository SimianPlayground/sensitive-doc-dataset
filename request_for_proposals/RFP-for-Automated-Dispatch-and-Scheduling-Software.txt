2.0      Technical Specifications
2.1      General Overview
ClasTran is seeking bids for a modern software solution for the management of demand response transportation. It
can be securely accessed via standard web browsers and should incorporate industry-leading tools to effectively
monitor operational processes and resources. The selected Proposal will be for intuitive, easy to use GIS-based
scheduling and dispatch software that accurately selects the most appropriate vehicle/run to place reservations using
a batch scheduling process that improves overall on-time performance. ClasTran must also have the option of
purchasing Mobile Data Computers or Tablets as a part of this project.
The selected software is expected to provide the capability to automate real time scheduling functions while
increasing the efficiency (on average 20%-40%) of service, increasing the accuracy of data, and reducing time spent on
administrative and reporting activities. The basic program features should include client registration, scheduling,
dispatching, trip brokering, verification, invoicing, reporting, geo-coding, mapping, eliminate paper manifests, and
reduce the number of routes and vehicles needed to maintain service levels. Customers and their caregivers shall
have the option of scheduling trips in a web-hosted and/or app-based portal. The system shall include on-time
performance and ridership information. The system shall also provide turn-by-turn directions, calculate drive time
and mileage, and visually display vehicles, trips and routes. An open architecture is required to enable future
integration with add-on technologies.
The Proposals must successfully address the software requirements outlined in this document. The software should
generate statistics which enable the user to determine the schedule’s efficiency. Real-time optimization allows for the
most efficient scheduling and reporting approach. ClasTran shall have the ability to accept or reject the entire
proposed schedule or portions of the schedule in addition to providing live updates to the drivers. Users shall have
the ability to auto-schedule trips that may run late through the use of the software’s automated alternate route
placement options. Another desired function is to have the ability to re-optimize the same day at a designated point
of the day, based on same day cancellations and route changes. They system shall have the ability to track the various
performance metrics for drivers. The solution shall have the ability to optimize schedule in real time. The real-time
automatic vehicle locator (AVL) will assist in optimizing management of the fleet and managing the speed history of
vehicles.
The software that ClasTran is seeking should guard against the occurrences of ADA denials. The software shall ensure
that there are zero denials and that a viable solution to provide customers with the scheduled pickup times even
when capacity constraints are reached. The software shall have the functionality to manage daily changes proactively,
as well as managing vehicle capacity as trip demands change. The software shall respond automatically to road
conditions such as traffic congestion, weather, and vehicle breakdowns. Ideally, the software will include a method of
providing updates to customers via mobile app notifications or automated mass voice or text messages.
The solution that ClasTran is seeking should provide an integrated account-based electronic fare collection (EFC)
system, as ClasTran seeks to reduce its current dependence on cash and paper tickets. Ideally, this would be an open
loop EFC system to support multiple payment methods including, but not limited to, NFC-enabled fare cards,
credit/debit cards, mobile devices, etc.; however, ClasTran is willing to consider alternatives (e.g., a fully integrated
closed loop EFC system, QR code or barcode validation, etc.) with the expectation that the software provider plans to
provide an open loop, NFC-enabled EFC system in the future and/or, at a minimum, currently supports integration
with third-party EFC systems and can recommend a list of vendors. The account-based EFC system should support
integration with ClasTran’s website and provide a ClasTran-branded mobile app, which customers and their caregivers
can use to load funds into their respective accounts.
ClasTran is also interested in the possibility of utilizing an interactive voice response (IVR) system for certain

                                                                                                                     9
functions, such as cancelling trips or providing ETA information for customers. If the software provides or supports
these features, please include the cost information as an additional option to the Proposal and/or provide a list of
recommended service providers.
ClasTran requires standardized reports. These reports should lend ClasTran with features that would allow for
reporting to local, state, and federal governing bodies. These reports should be geared to provide information
required for completing the National Transit Data audit and report. Export capabilities are an important feature which
must be available when utilizing reports. The reports shall also be instrumental in ClasTran’s ability to gain
information on operational efficiencies of the service and schedules. ClasTran requires the ability to have customized
reports developed. Users shall have the ability (through either the standardized reports or through customization) to
run reports which shall be geared towards providing extensive trip data, AVL information, driver efficiencies, and no-
show reports. There shall be various user guides including, but not limited to, dispatch and driver user guides.

    written notice to contractor when it is in the recipient's best interest. Contractor shall be paid its costs, including contract
    close-out costs, and profit on work performed up to the time of termination. Contractor shall promptly submit its termination

breach of that or of any other term, covenant, or condition of this Contract.

contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the recipient's interest. If the contract is terminated, the recipient shall be liable only for

specifying the nature of default. Contractor shall only be paid the contract price for supplies delivered and accepted, or services
performed in accordance with the manner or performance set forth in this contract. If, after termination for failure to fulfill
contract obligations, it is determined that contractor was not in default, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as
if termination had been issued for the recipient’s convenience.

g. Termination for Default (Transportation Services) If contractor fails to pick up the commodities or to perform the services,
including delivery services, within the time specified in this contract or any extension or if contractor fails to comply with any
other provisions of this contract, the recipient may terminate this contract for default. The recipient shall terminate by delivering to

Failure to agree on an amount shall be resolved under the Dispute clause. If, after termination for failure
to fulfill contract obligations, it is determined that contractor was not in default, the rights and
obligations of the parties shall be the same as if termination had been issued for the recipient’s
convenience.
h. Termination for Default (Construction) If contractor refuses or fails to prosecute the work or any separable part, with the
diligence that will insure its completion within the time specified, or any extension, or fails to complete the work within this time,
or if contractor fails to comply with any other provisions of this contract, the recipient may terminate this contract for default. the
recipient shall terminate by delivering to contractor a notice of termination specifying the nature of default. In this event, the
recipient may take over the work and compete it by contract or otherwise, and may take possession of and use any materials,
appliances, and plant on the work site necessary for completing the work. Contractor and its sureties shall be liable for any
damage to the recipient resulting from contractor's refusal or failure to complete the work within specified time, whether or not
contractor's right to proceed with the work is terminated. This liability includes any increased costs incurred by the recipient in
completing the work.
Contractor's right to proceed shall not be terminated nor shall contractor be charged with damages
under this clause if:
1. Delay in completing the work arises from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of
contractor. Examples of such causes include: acts of God, acts of the recipient, acts of another contractor in the performance
of a contract with the recipient, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes; and
2. Contractor, within 10 days from the beginning of any delay, notifies the recipient in writing of the causes of delay. If in the
recipient’s judgment, delay is excusable, the time for completing the work shall be extended. The recipient’s judgment shall be final
and conclusive on the parties, but subject to appeal under the Disputes clauses.
If, after termination of contractor's right to proceed, it is determined that contractor was not in
default, or that the delay was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties will be the same as if
termination had been issued for the recipient’s convenience.
i. Termination for Convenience or Default (Architect & Engineering) the recipient may terminate this contract in whole or in part, for
the recipient's convenience or because of contractor’s failure to fulfill contract obligations. The recipient shall terminate by
delivering to contractor a notice of termination specifying the nature, extent, and effective date of termination. Upon receipt of the
notice, contractor shall (1) immediately discontinue all services affected (unless the notice directs otherwise), and (2) deliver to the
recipient all data, drawings, specifications, reports, estimates, summaries, and other information and materials accumulated in
performing this contract, whether completed or in process. If termination is for the recipient’s convenience, it shall make
an equitable adjustment in the contract price but shall allow no anticipated profit on unperformed
services. If termination is for contractor’s failure to fulfill contract obligations, the recipient may complete
the work by contact or otherwise and contractor shall be liable for any additional cost incurred by the
recipient. If, after termination for failure to fulfill contract obligations, it is determined that contractor was
not in default, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if termination had been issued
for the recipient’s convenience.

j. Termination for Convenience or Default (Cost-Type Contracts) the recipient may terminate this contract,
or any portion of it, by serving a notice or termination on contractor. The notice shall state whether
termination is for convenience of the recipient or for default of contractor. If termination is for default,
the notice shall state the manner in which contractor has failed to perform the requirements of the                                            34
     contract. Contractor shall account for any property in its possession paid for from funds received from
     the recipient, or property supplied to contractor by the recipient. If termination is for default, the
     recipient may fix the fee, if the contract provides for a fee, to be paid to contractor in proportion to the
     value, if any, of work performed up to the time of termination. Contractor shall promptly submit its
     termination claim to the recipient and the parties shall negotiate the termination settlement to be paid
     to contractor. If termination is for the recipient’s convenience, contractor shall be paid its contract
     close-out costs, and a fee, if the contract provided for payment of a fee, in proportion to the work
     performed up to the time of termination. If, after serving a notice of termination for default, the recipient
     determines that contractor has an excusable reason for not performing, such as strike, fire, flood, events
     which are not the fault of and are beyond the control of contractor, the recipient, after setting up a new
     work schedule, may allow contractor to continue work, or treat the termination as a termination for
     convenience.
