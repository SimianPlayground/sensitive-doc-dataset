                                      SECTION TWO – BACKGROUND

2.1       BACKGROUND INFORMATION
UND is the state’s flagship research university, with nearly 15,000 students, 225+ fields of study, and
accredited professional schools of law and medicine. In addition to its extensive undergraduate
programs, UND offers 40 online degree programs and 84 graduate programs.

On July 1, 2016, Mark Kennedy became UND’s President. Under his new visionary leadership, UND
will enhance its marketing and communication efforts. Reinvigorating the website is a top priority.
Content Management System
OmniUpdate (OU) provides the content management system for most UND websites. Since the launch
of the OU-based website in 2011, work has focused on migrating content to OU and training UND’s
500+ content developers who create, publish and manage their own content with little oversight. This
has resulted in 30,000+ OU pages, many of which are plagued by outdated, poorly constructed and
duplicate content.
No major website revisions have occurred since 2011, but some enhancements have included a custom
calendar embed, online form processing and emailing, reusable code snippets, database-driven faculty
directory, and custom OU templates for select landing pages.
Note: This project does not include any UND websites that will remain outside of OU.
Governance
Efforts to establish Web governance have failed in the past; therefore, the UND website is not
governed by a Web policy. Developing a Web Governance Policy is a mandate of the newly formed
UND Marketing Council, whose work is expected to occur concurrently with the proposed project.
A project team will be formed, under the direction of the Provost, to make final decisions regarding the
proposed effort.
Templates
UND OU pages generally fall into one of three categories:
  1. Academic templates are typically used by colleges, schools, departments or units whose
     mission is predominantly teaching or research. These templates have horizontal global
     navigation (orange bar), a unique logo in the header, and custom home page templates.
  2. Nonacademic templates are reserved for units that provide the leadership and/or services that
     keep the University operating and on mission. These templates do not have horizontal global
     navigation and use the primary UND logo in the header.
  3. Organization templates are used by student organizations, individual faculty sites, university
     affiliates, and events. These templates offer some flexibility in layout, color schemes and font
     choices.
It is expected the abovementioned template structure will change as a result of this project.
Integrations
The UND OU site has system integrations that may be impacted by this project. It is expected the
Contractor will assume responsibility to:
          Troubleshoot technical issues that could arise.
          Provide integration owners with specifications to replicate the new template and navigation
           structure.


                                                  Page 7 of 25
RFP # 43-2017
       Create new templates for OmniUpdate with the flexibility to accept a variety of future
        integrations.

Integrations present on the site that must be taken into consideration for the proposed effort include,
but are not limited to:
       Bomgar Chat Software
       Custom Embedded Apps: Job Openings Database, TINT, A-Z Index, Directories
       Emergency Notifications
       Faculty Finder
       Google Search Appliance
       Social Media Embeds

TARGET AUDIENCE
UND does not currently leverage an Intranet-based environment. To prepare for an eventual
transition, it is anticipated that the website will be split into two separate navigation structures with
different target audiences for each site.
    1. A marketing site will serve primarily prospective students and their parents. It will also have a=
       strong focus on serving current students. Secondary audiences for this site include:
           a. Research Community
           b. Government Constituents (state legislature, city government, etc.)
           c. Business and Industry (entities who employ graduates, and those seeking University=
               partnerships)
           d. Donors
           e. Athletic Fans

    2. A publically accessible internal site in OU that serves faculty and staff.


GOALS
The project has several goals, stated in order of importance:
    1. Shift to a responsive design framework using the existing content management system,
       OmniUpdate.
    2. Provide a visitor-centric, rather than organization-driven, information architecture and
       navigation.
    3. Redevelop the site into a marketing hub to attract the right students to UND with relevant
       content, calls to action and a fresh design.
    4. Convert the UND calendar from an outdated custom application into an off-the-shelf, enterprise-
       graded calendaring software providing synchronization with industry-standard calendars
       including Outlook, iCal, and Google Calendar.
    5. Ensure the site complies with required federal and state accessibility standards.


2.1.    BUDGET
UND has not established a budget for this contract.

                                   SECTION THREE – SCOPE OF WORK

3.0 SCOPE OF WORK
The intent of this project is to redesign UND's OmniUpdate system into a responsive,
marketable and user friendly site.
3.1.    APPLICABLE DIRECTIVES
This information technology project is subject to the following directives:
    •           SBHE Policy 1901.3 related to Information Technology Project Management
    •           NDUS Procedure 1901.3 related to Information Technology Approval Process

3.2.    INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION
A. Requirements
The proposal should include specific tasks and milestones required for successful implementation of
each phase listed below. Additional tasks that exceed the list of minimum deliverables may be included
in an addendum to the financial proposal.
A design and approval process will be articulated by the Contractor and approved by the UND Project
Team. The selected Contractor can expect to work collaboratively with the UND Project Team
throughout the duration of the project, although the Contractor will be expected to perform all proposed
tasks. Please describe the proposed methodology for this effort.
Analysis
Please describe the process the vendor will use to analyze the work that will need to be performed. Key
areas that need to be included are:
        How the Contractor will utilize the full access of our Google Analytics on OU websites in order to
         evaluate effectiveness and optimize functionality of analytics as leveraged throughout the
         institution. This should include reviewing current Google Analytics configuration and reports, and
         making suggestions for collecting or analyzing data.
      Usability for prospective students is a top concern. Please describe the testing tools and
         methodology, proposed by the Contractor. Any third party tools will need to be included in the
         cost proposal. Key areas should include user task analysis, readability, site navigability,
         accessibility, and user experience.
      A competitive analysis will be performed by the Contractor. Specifically, UND is looking for ways
         to differentiate its online presence from North Dakota State University and University of
         Minnesota – Twin Cities. Please describe the methodology the Contractor will use and the
         anticipated output.
      Please describe how the Contractor will conduct in-person on-campus stakeholder interviews or
         focus groups with select administration, faculty, staff, and current students in order to gather
         additional stakeholder information.
Based on findings from this phase and the Contractor’s knowledge of best practices, the Contractor
must deliver a strategy report that drives subsequent project phases. Please describe what this report
will look like and other information it will contain.
Information Architecture
The objective of this phase is to provide a more visitor-centric, rather than organization driven,
information architecture and navigation. Using knowledge gleaned from Phase I, Phase II will be
                                                 Page 9 of 25
RFP # 43-2017
accomplished by performing a comprehensive site audit and making suggestions to rename,
reorganize, and add/remove pages. Additionally, the site must be divided into external and internal
content, with specific attention to content for faculty and staff separated from marketing content.
Deliverables from this phase include an audit report and a sitemap that clearly defines global navigation
and subpage navigation.
Template Design and Testing
The Contractor must provide a minimum of three unique responsive design concepts with each
consisting of a home page and inner page layouts. Schematics/wireframes along with creative artwork
and copy are to be included with each concept. The designs must strictly adhere to the UND Identity
Guidelines (UND.edu/identity). The templates must fulfill best practices for usability and accessibility
and comply with federal and state accessibility standards. Ease of use for the end user (content
developer) must also be considered. The Offeror must provide proof of meeting these guidelines.
Please describe how you intend approaching meeting these standards.
The concepts will be reviewed by the project team and one concept will be selected to develop the new
templates. Responsive template development should include:
       Design basics such as multiple layouts, a pattern library, web-friendly fonts, page printing
        options, icons, graphics, etc.
       HTML and CSS that retains mark-up references in order to limit the amount of content that
        needs to change in OU.
       XSL that uses potions of the current XSL to transform raw content in OU pages into usable
        website pages.
       Programming (ColdFusion and PHP) to pull together different parts of the pages such as
        headers, footers, and more complex pages or content.
       OU templates (TCF and TMPL files) with flexible layout options.
       Open graph compatible meta data.
       Search engine optimization.

The Contractor will work with the UND Project Team to test (e.g., code validation and fix bugs)=
templates.
Content Creation and Migration
Much of the site content will remain the same; however, there will be changes in the following areas:
       Key Marketing Pages – The Contractor is to create up to 30 marketing-focused pages,
        including the UND home page and primary landing pages. New pages must include
        documentation of SEO initiatives implemented, including projected Google search rankings
        amongst top site keywords.
       Content (Copy/Graphics/Videos) – The Project Team will use its photography database to
        update photography; however, new body copy, graphics and video elements are expected from
        the Contractor for key marketing pages.
       Calls-to-Action – Generating action (e.g., getting prospective students into the admissions
        funnel, having current students share pages via social media) will require changes to copy and
        page functionality.
       New Calendar – UND’s calendar system is custom and no longer meeting needs. A new off-
        the-shelf calendar system including full synchronization capacity with Outlook and industry-
        standard calendaring such as CalDAV, Google Calendar etc. must be selected by the
        Contractor and integrated throughout the site.
                                                Page 10 of 25
RFP # 43-2017
A formal protocol will be established by the project team to audit existing content in OU and prepare it
for migration into the new templates. The Contractor will serve as a consultant during this process. The
Contractor will provide UND with a training guide to be used by content developers prior to and
following the site launch.
Please describe how the Contractor will support UND with this process including the possibility of
collaborating with OmniUpdate directly to assist with the migration of content to the new templates
using the OU Campus Migration Tool.
Post-Launch Usability Testing and Support
The Contractor is expected to test the effectiveness of the site post launch by repeating the usability
testing conducted in Analysis to confirm the success of the design. Please describe the process the
Contractor will use to re-test usability.
The Contractor will provide 160 hours of post-launch support to the UND Project Team. Please
describe the support services the Contractor will provide.
OPTIONAL ADD-ON TASKS
The following items are options that UND would like the Contractor to describe and price as optional

PROPOSAL IS DETERMINED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SOLICITATION AND IS DETERMINED TO BE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS IN CONSIDERATION OF
THE RFP EVALUATION CRITERIA.EVALUATION CRITERIA
Proposals will be evaluated using a 100-point scale. The evaluation criteria and relative weight is as
follows:
Technical Proposal Evaluation: 75 Points
    A. Approach to Work – 30 Points
    B. Experience and Qualifications – 45 Points
Cost Proposal Evaluation: 25 Points
5.2 PROPOSAL EVALUATION
    A. Responsiveness
        All proposals will be evaluated to determine if they are responsive to the requirements of the
        solicitation. UND reserves the right to waive minor informalities. Minor informalities are
        insignificant omissions or nonjudgmental mistakes that are matters of form rather than
        substance, evident from RFP document, with a negligible effect on price, quantity, quality,
        delivery, or contractual conditions that can be waived or corrected without prejudice to other
        offerors.
        Responsive proposals will be evaluated by the procurement officer or evaluation committee
        using the evaluation criteria stated in the RFP. The technical proposals evaluation score and
        cost proposal evaluation score will be added to determine the total evaluation score. After the
        initial evaluation, the evaluation committee may determine which proposals are reasonably
        susceptible for award and short-list the evaluation process to only those offerors. The final
        evaluation score will consider information received by UND, including but not limited to,
        discussions with offerors, demonstrations, presentations, site visits, reference checks, and best
        and final offers.
    B. Responsibility
        UND may, at any time, make a supplementary investigation as to the responsibility of any
        offeror. This investigation may include, but is not limited to, financial responsibility, performance
        record, or other matters related to the offeror’s probable ability to deliver if a contract is awarded
        to the offeror. UND reserves the right to contact references, other customers, including state
        and local government agencies, regarding past experience with the offeror. If it is determined
        that an offeror appears not to be sufficiently responsible, the proposal will be rejected.
5.3 COST PROPOSAL EVALUATIONS – RECIPROCAL PREFERENCE
UND will calculate evaluation points awarded to cost proposals. Any prompt payment discount terms
proposed by the offeror will not be considered in evaluating cost.
The cost amount used for evaluation may be affected by the application of North Dakota Preference
laws in accordance with SBHE Policy 803.1(7).

RFP # 43-2017
After applying any reciprocal preference, the cost proposal with the lowest cost will receive the
maximum number of points. Points awarded to other cost proposals will be calculated as follows:




5.4 CLARIFICATIONS OF OFFERORS – DISCUSSIONS
In order to determine if a proposal is reasonably susceptible for award, communications by the
procurement officer or evaluation committee are permitted with an offeror to clarify uncertainties or
eliminate confusion concerning the contents of a proposal and determine responsiveness to the RFP
requirements. Discussions will be limited to the specific section of the RFP or proposal indicated by the
UND.
In conducting discussions, there may be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals
submitted by competing offerors. Clarifications may not result in a material or substantive change to the
proposal.
Discussions are generally conducted by telephone or internet-based conference.
5.5 RIGHT OF REJECTION
UND reserves the right to reject any proposals, in whole or in part. Proposals received from suspended
or debarred bidders will be rejected. Proposals determined to be nonresponsive, to the requirements of
the RFP will be rejected. UND reserves the right to reject the proposal of an offeror determined to be
not responsible. UND reserves the right to refrain from making an award if determined to be in its best
interest.
5.6 PRESENTATIONS OR DEMONSTRATION
Offerors whose proposals are determined to be reasonably susceptible for award will be required to
provide a presentation for the evaluation committee. Offerors shall be responsible for all associated
costs, including any travel and per diem.
Location: Grand Forks, ND
5.7 BEST AND FINAL OFFERS
UND is not obligated to request best and final offerors; therefore, offerors should submit their best
terms (technical and cost) in response to this RFP.
If UND determines there is a need for any additional information, substantial clarification or changes to
the RFP or proposals, UND may request for best and final offers from offerors that have submitted
proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible for award. The best and final offer request will
describe the additional information, clarification, or change being requested.
A date and time will be established for receipt of revised proposals. If an offeror does not submit a best
and final offer, UND shall consider its original proposal as its best and final offer.
Best and final offers will be evaluated using the evaluation criteria stated in the RFP.

RFP # 43-2017
5.8 NEGOTIATIONS
UND may enter into negotiations with one or more offeror whose proposals received the highest scores
and are reasonably susceptible for award. During negotiations, UND and offeror may agree to alter or
otherwise change the terms and conditions and price of the proposed contract. Negotiation, if held, will
be within the scope of the RFP and limited to those items that would not have an effect on the ranking
of proposals.
The Offeror will be responsible for all costs, including any travel and per diem expenses.
Contract negotiations will be conducted primarily by e-mail, conference calls, or internet-based
conference. Any on-site negotiation, if needed, will be held at the University.
UND may terminate negotiations, reject a proposal as nonresponsive, and continue or commence
negotiations with other offerors reasonably susceptible for award, if the offeror:
    •           fails to provide necessary information for negotiation in a timely manner,
    •           fails to negotiate in good faith,
    •           is unable to successfully negotiate contract terms that are acceptable to UND, or
    •           indicates that it cannot perform the contract within the budgeted funds.
5.9 NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD
After proposals have been evaluated and the successful offeror selected, notice of intent to award will
be promptly issued to all offerors that submitted proposals. Upon issuance of this notice, the
procurement file becomes an open record.
The successful offeror named in the Notice of Intent to Award is advised not to begin work, purchase
materials, or enter into subcontracts until the successful offeror and UND sign the contract.
5.10 CONTRACT APPROVAL
This RFP does not, by itself, obligate UND. UND's obligation shall commence when UND signs the
contract. Upon written notice to the Contractor, UND may set a different starting date for the contract.
UND shall not be responsible for any work done by the Contractor, even work done in good faith, if it
occurs prior to the contract start date set by UND.

                                 SECTION SIX – CONTRACT INFORMATION

6.1 NORTH DAKOTA CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS – BACKGROUND
As a public institution and government entity of the North Dakota University System (NDUS), there are
a number of statutes, rules, and policies (Requirements) that may restrict or prevent UND from entering
into certain types of contracts or certain contractual terms and conditions, some of these Requirements
are non-negotiable.
While these requirements occasionally make the process of negotiating a contract with UND more
challenging than negotiating with a private industry business, these are not unique to any one institution
of the North Dakota University System. These requirements apply to all public institutions and
government entities of the state of North Dakota. Although some are unique to North Dakota, the
majority of these requirements are common to public institutions and government entities throughout
the United States.
6.2 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS – OFFEROR’S PROPOSED CHANGES
UND intends to execute a contract substantially similar to the Contract – Attachment 3. The Contractor
must comply with the terms and conditions set forth in attached contract. Relevant North Dakota and
SBHE procurement statutes, rules, and policies allow some negotiation of the terms and conditions. No
changes to the terms and conditions will be permitted without prior written approval from UND.
Proposals subject to conditions imposed by the Offeror may be rejected as nonresponsive, as
determined by UND.
Proposed terms and conditions that conflict with those contained in the attached contract or that
diminish the UND’s rights under the contract shall be considered null and void. The terms and
conditions in the attached contract shall prevail in the event a conflict arises between a term or
condition in the proposal and a term or condition in the attached contract.
Part or all of this RFP and offeror’s proposal may be incorporated into the attached contract.
Proposed alternate language shall not be considered accepted by UND without UND’s written
acceptance of such language. UND may deem any failure to object to a contract provision as the
Offeror’s acceptance of that provision.
UND instructs Offerors to contact the Procurement Officer in writing by the deadline set for questions in
the RFP Schedule with any concerns regarding the contract provisions, including any proposed,
alternate language.
6.3 CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS – NO MATERIAL CHANGES
    A.1.2 Indemnification and Insurance
                N.D.C.C. § 32-12.2-17 requires that the Office of Management and Budget establish
                guidelines for indemnification and insurance provisions in state contracts. The
                indemnification and insurance requirements contained in the attached contract are pursuant
                to those guidelines. UND shall not be deemed to have accepted any alteration of these
                provisions without prior written approval to offeror from UND acting in consultation with
                NDUS general counsel.




                                                   Page 23 of 25
RFP # 43-2017
                Indemnification
                Indemnification is a contractual clause by which one party to a contract asks the other party
                to defend it against any claims of third parties who might be injured as a result of something
                that occurs while the parties are performing their duties and obligations under the contract.
                Without specific authority and approval to do so, as outlined in SBHE Policy 840, UND
                institutions cannot enter into agreements indemnifying contractors, or any other entity,
                against third party claims.
                Any clause that has the intent of indemnification, without using the words “indemnity” or
                “indemnify,” are not clauses to which UND may agree, except in conformity with SBHE
                Policy 840.
                You are cautioned that UND will not agree to clauses to indemnify a contractor “to the extent
                permitted by law.” Two reasons exist for this position. First, UND knows that the extent to
                which the law permits it to indemnify contractors is to no or very limited extent, and it would
                therefore be disingenuous for UND to imply in a contract that there might be some set of
                circumstances under which UND would defend the contractor against a third party claim(s).
                Simply put, UND is not going to agree to something it knows it cannot do. Second, the
                “extent” clause is simply an invitation to litigate the matter in the event a third party claim(s)
                arises, and UND does not enter into agreements that invite litigation.
                Insurance
                Upon receipt of the Notice of Intent to Award, the successful offeror must obtain the required
                insurance coverage and provide the procurement officer with proof of coverage prior to
                contract approval. The coverage must be satisfactory to UND, in consultation with NDUS
                general counsel. The successful offeror’s failure to provide evidence of insurance coverage
                is a material breach and grounds for withdrawal of the award or termination of the contract.
    A.1.3 Limitation of Liability N.D.C.C. § 32-12.2-15 establishes that UND is prohibited from limiting
          direct damages, including those resulting from property damage or personal injury. Any
          request by an offeror for UND to limit direct damages is a request to which UND cannot
          agree. Waivers of Jurisdiction and Venue; Alternative Dispute Resolution
                You are cautioned that the UND has limited authority to agree to the jurisdiction or the laws
                of another state or federal courts, and cannot do so except in consultation with NDUS
                general counsel. You are further cautioned that the UND has limited authority to
                contractually agree to alternative dispute resolution methods, and cannot agree to do so
                except in consultation with NDUS general counsel.
    A.1.4 Confidentiality
                All state agencies of North Dakota are subject to North Dakota public records laws. UND
                cannot agree to contractual terms that attempt to prevent it from having to disclose records
                that are declared public records under applicable statutes. Although some confidentiality
                and exemptions are allowed under the public records laws, UND may not agree to more
                restrictive obligations concerning its records. Under North Dakota public records laws,
                contracts are records that are open to the public and may be reviewed at the request of the
                public.

RFP # 43-2017
    A.1.5 Unliquidated Expenses (i.e., attorney’s fees, add-ons, cost increases)
                Because UND may only obligate those funds that have been appropriated to it by the
                Legislative Assembly and may only obligate those funds for the purposes for which the
                funds were appropriated, UND will not agree to clauses which may obligate it to pay for
                claims that might exceed its current funding appropriation.
6.4 SCOPE OF WORK
The Scope of Work agreed upon by the parties will be incorporated into the attached contract.
6.5 CONTRACT TERM
The contract term will be set forth in contract, including any options for extension, renewal, and
renegotiation.
6.6 COMPENSATION
Compensation and payment terms will be set forth in the contract based upon the successful offeror’s
proposal.
6.7 TAXES
A contractor performing any contract, including service contracts, for the United States Government,
State of North Dakota, counties, cities, school districts, park board or any other political subdivisions
within North Dakota is not exempt from payment of sales or use tax on material and supplies used or
consumed in carrying out contracts. In these cases, the contractor is required to file returns and pay
sales and use tax just as required for contracts with private parties. Contact the North Dakota Tax
Department at 701-328-1246 or visit its website at www.nd.gov/tax/ for more information.
A contractor performing any contract, including a service contract, within North Dakota is also subject to
the corporation income tax, individual income tax, and withholding tax reporting requirements, whether
the contract is performed by a corporation, partnership, or other business entity, or as an employee of
the contractor. In the case of employees performing the services in the state, the contractor is required
to withhold state income tax from the employees' compensation and remit to the state as required by
law. Contact the North Dakota Tax Department at 701-328-1248 or visit its web site for more
information.

                            PROPOSAL EVALUATION PROCESS

Evaluators will use the technical proposal evaluation form in scoring responsive technical
proposals. UND has assigned each evaluation criterion and the relative weight. The
procurement officer will use the proposal evaluation worksheet to tally the scores for each
vendor and to summarize the evaluation scoring. All final technical proposal evaluation forms
and the proposal evaluation worksheet are included in the procurement file.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR EVALUATORS
UND has assigned each evaluation criterion a specific number of points. The questions under
each evaluated area help measure the quality of the Offeror’s response. Do not assign points to
individual questions: instead, award a total score for each evaluation criterion. Use the technical
proposal evaluation form to make brief comments and score the proposal.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST:
Each evaluator must review the list of offerors submitting proposals and determine if they or any
immediate family members have a conflict of interest with regard to an offeror, in accordance
with SBHE Policy 611.4. By signing on the technical proposal evaluation form, evaluator is
confirming no conflict of interest exists with the offeror being evaluated.

RATING SCALE FOR ASSESSING VENDOR RESPONSES
UND intends this rating scale to establish guidelines within that range to ensure members of the
RFP evaluation committee perform their evaluation with consistency. Evaluators may assign
any value for a given criterion from zero to the maximum number of points. A zero value
typically constitutes no response or an inability of the vendor to meet the criterion. In contrast,
the maximum value should constitute a high standard of meeting the criterion.

For Example: “Experience and Qualifications” is an evaluation criterion receiving a weighting of
20% of the total possible points. Using a 100-Point Scale, there can be a maximum of 20 points
awarded. The rating scale would be:

                                  Rating Scale (20 POINT Maximum)
              Point
              Value        Explanation
              0            None. Not addressed or response of no value
              1-5          Fair. Limited applicability
              6-10         Good. Some applicability
              11-15        Very Good. Substantial applicability
              16-20        Excellent. Total applicability

COST PROPOSAL
The offeror is required to place cost proposals in a separate sealed envelope, and the pricing
will not be disclosed to the evaluation committee until after the initial evaluation of proposals is
completed.
UND will evaluate cost as follows:




                                            Page 1 of 10

                           PROPOSAL EVALUATION PROCESS

Applying Preference Laws
UND will not consider any prompt payment discounts terms proposed by the Offeror when
evaluating cost. The cost amount used for evaluation may be affected by the application of
North Dakota preference laws (N.D.C.C. § 44-08-01). The preference given to a resident Offeror
will be equal to the preference given or required by the state of the nonresident Offeror (i.e.
reciprocal preference).
When evaluating cost proposals from nonresident (out-of-state) Offerors, the State will
determine whether the Offeror’s state of residence has a preference law for vendors resident in
that state. The State will increase the cost proposal of the nonresident Offeror by the same
percentage of preference given to vendors resident in that state.
For example, if the state law of the nonresident Offeror requires a 5% preference for vendors
resident in that state, the procurement officer will increase that Offeror’s cost proposal by 5%
before evaluation.
See http://www.oregon.gov/DAS/Procurement/pages/index.aspx for a list of states Preference
Laws or contact the Procurement Officer for more information.
Converting Cost to Points
After applying any reciprocal preference, the lowest cost proposal will receive the maximum
number of points allocated to cost. The point allocations for cost on the other proposals will be
determined as follows:

INSTRUCTIONS FOR EVALUATORS

It is very important that Evaluators first read all proposals one time without scoring. During the second
reading, Evaluators should make notes about the proposals to support the initial scores. Evaluators
should also write down any questions, concerns, or additional information they would like to help them
better understand the proposals; these issues can be discussed during evaluation meetings.

Proposals must be evaluated using the evaluation criteria published in the RFP. A 100-point scale will
be used to evaluate proposals that are responsive to the RFP requirements.

Evaluation Criteria

25 Points – Cost Proposals. Cost will be evaluated by procurement staff. Cost will not be revealed to
Evaluators until the Technical scores are finalized.

     75 Points – Technical Proposal

        45 Points – Experience, Qualifications and Similar Work
             o Experience of the Offeror performing similar work
             o Experience and qualifications of the project team
             o References
             o Sample Work

        30 Points – Approach the Work
             o Ability to meet the requirements of the scope of work
             o Ability to meet the required timeline
             o Value added services
             o Response to Contract Terms and Conditions


The questions under each evaluated area help you measure the quality of the offeror’s response. Do
not assign points to individual questions, instead, award a total score for each evaluation criterion.
Evaluators are not comparing proposals against each other to create a ranking (e.g. 1 st, 2nd, etc.).
Instead, Evaluators are scoring proposal using the evaluation criteria and rating scales, so there may be
multiple proposals that score in the “very good” or “excellent” range.

EVALUATION RATING SCALE
This rating scale is used to ensure consistency in awarding evaluation points. Evaluators may assign any
value for a given criterion from 0 to the maximum number of points. A score of zero or low point value is
typically given when the proposal either did not provide the requested information or provided a response
of no or limited applicability. A high or maximum score should constitute a high standard of meeting the
criterion.

5. TERM OF CONTRACT
Note: Per SBHE Policy 803.1, part 5, service contracts have a maximum term of ten years
including all extensions and renewals.
    This Contract begins on its effective date and ends on [Month, Day], 20[Year].
    a. No Automatic Renewal
    This Contract will not automatically renew.
Note: Any exercise of an Extension, Renewal, or Renegotiation requires a written contract
amendment identifying the amended terms and conditions. Contract amendments should be
drafted in consultation with assigned legal counsel.
    b. Extension Option




                             T
Note: An Extension is a brief period of time used to wrap up ongoing work that could not be
completed by the end of the Contract. It may also be used when all renewal options have been
exercised and additional time is needed to close out the Contract.
        UND reserves the right to extend the Contract for an additional period of time, not to exceed

    c. Renewal Option
                          AF
        _____ months, beyond the current termination date of the Contract.


        UND may renew this Contract upon satisfactory completion of the initial Contract term. UND
        reserves the right to execute up to _____options to renew this Contract under the same terms
        and conditions for a period of _____ months each.
    d. Renegotiation Option
        In view of the fact that it is unknown how long the products and services will be employed by
        UND and that UND will require ongoing maintenance and support of the products for as long as
        the system is operational, therefore after completion of the initial term of the Contract including
        R

        mutual agreement of the parties.
    e. Performance Review

        starting on the effective date of the Contract.

        This Contract may be terminated by mutual consent of both parties executed in writing.
    b. Early Termination in the Public Interest
        UND is entering into this Contract for the purpose of carrying out the public policy of the State of
        North Dakota, as determined by its Governor, Legislative Assembly, the State Board of Higher
        Education and Courts. If this Contract ceases to further the public policy of the State of North

        Contract in whole or in part.
    c. Termination for Non-appropriation
        Continuation of this Agreement beyond June 30 of any odd-numbered year is contingent on
        continued legislative appropriation of funds for the purposes of this Agreement. If those
        appropriations are not forthcoming, UND will notify the CONTRACTOR as soon as possible and




                             T
        the Agreement will terminate on June 30 of that year. UND will not be penalized or incur any
        liability because of termination of the Agreement as provided in this section. Any such

        party already accrued prior to such termination.
    d. Termination for Lack of Funding or Authority
                          AF
        UND, by written notice to CONTRACTOR, may terminate the whole or any part of this Contract
        under any of the following conditions:
        1) If funding from federal, state, or other sources is not obtained and continued at levels
           sufficient to allow for purchase of the services or supplies in the indicated quantities or term.
        2) If federal or state laws or rules are modified or interpreted in a way that the services are no
           longer allowable or appropriate for purchase under this Contract or are no longer eligible for
           the funding proposed for payments authorized by this Contract.
        3) If any license, permit, or certificate required by law or rule, or by the terms of this Contract, is
           for any reason denied, revoked, suspended, or not renewed.
        R
        Termination of this Contract under this subsection is without prejudice to any obligations or
        liabilities of either party already accrued prior to termination.
    e. Termination for Cause.
        UND may terminate this Contract effective upon delivery of written notice to CONTRACTOR, or
D

        any later date stated in the notice:
        1) If CONTRACTOR fails to provide services required by this Contract within the time specified
           or any extension agreed to by UND; or
        2) If CONTRACTOR fails to perform any of the other provisions of this Contract, or so fails to
           pursue the work as to endanger performance of this Contract in accordance with its terms.
        The rights and remedies of UND provided in this subsection are not exclusive and are in
        addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this Contract.
8. SUSPENSION FOR CONVENIENCE
    UND shall have the right at any time to order the services of CONTRACTOR fully or partially
    stopped for UND’s own convenience. UND shall provide CONTRACTOR written notice of the
    reason for and duration of the suspension. The schedule shall be delayed on a day-for-day basis to
    the extent UND has issued a stop work order to CONTRACTOR and such stop work order is
    causing delays in completing services in accordance with the schedule. CONTRACTOR shall have
                                                  Page 4 of 16
<Contract Name or Contract Reference Number>
    the right to submit claims in accordance with the terms of this Contract as a result of stop work
    orders issued under this section.
9. FORCE MAJEURE
    Neither party shall be held responsible for delay or default caused by fire, riot, terrorism, acts of
    God or war if the event is beyond the party’s reasonable control and the affected party gives notice
    to the other party immediately upon occurrence of the event causing the delay or default or that is
    reasonably expected to cause a delay or default.
10. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
Note: UND may suffer damages if CONTRACTOR fails to perform on schedule. Liquidated
damages clauses assist UND in being made whole if this occurs. While it is impracticable to
compute—at the time of contracting—the exact damages caused by a future delay, the parties
can agree on an amount that is a fair and reasonable estimate of damages due to UND in the
event of a delay by CONTRACTOR. An agency shall discuss liquidated damages clauses with
assigned legal counsel.




                             T
    The parties agree that UND may suffer damages due to a failure by CONTRACTOR to provide
    deliverables or services under this Contract. Because it is difficult to fix the actual damages
    sustained in the event of such delays, UND and CONTRACTOR agree that the amount of damages
    will be determined as per this Section. In the event of any non-performance CONTRACTOR shall
    pay that amount as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. Amounts due to UND as liquidated
                          AF
    damages may be deducted by UND from any amounts payable to CONTRACTOR, and any amount
    outstanding over and above the amounts deducted from the invoice will be promptly tendered by
    check from CONTRACTOR to UND.
    Delays due to causes of Force Majeure or due to the responsibility of UND shall extend the time for
    performance on a day-for-day basis. UND will not assess liquidated damages against
    CONTRACTOR when the delay in delivery or performance is beyond the control and without the
    fault or negligence of CONTRACTOR.
Note: The following are examples of liquidated damages provisions. One or both may be
applicable. Assigned legal counsel should assist in selecting or drafting appropriate language
        R
for liquidated damages.
    a. Failure to Complete Deliverable on Schedule:
        If CONTRACTOR fails to complete a Deliverable identified in <SOW or project schedule
        reference> by the specified deadline (or revised deadline as agreed upon between the parties
        through the Integrated Change Control Process), CONTRACTOR shall pay liquidated damages
        to UND in the amount of $ <amount> per calendar day for each day the Deliverable is delayed.
D

    b. Failure to Complete Project on Schedule:
        If CONTRACTOR fails to complete the project per the approved project schedule by the
        specified deadline (or revised deadline as agreed upon between the parties through the
        Integrated Change Control Process), UND will deduct liquidated damages from amounts
        payable to CONTRACTOR in the amount of $ <amount> per calendar day for each day the
        project is delayed.
11. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
    CONTRACTOR shall immediately report to UND any and all unauthorized disclosures or uses of
    UND’s Confidential Information or Proprietary Information of which CONTRACTOR or its staff is
    aware or has knowledge. CONTRACTOR acknowledges that any unauthorized publication or
    disclosure of UND’s Confidential Information or Proprietary Information to others may cause
    immediate and irreparable harm to UND. If CONTRACTOR should publish or disclose such
                                                Page 5 of 16
<Contract Name or Contract Reference Number>
    Confidential Information or Proprietary Information without authorization, UND shall immediately be
    entitled to seek injunctive relief or any other remedies to which it is entitled under law or equity
    without requiring a cure period. CONTRACTOR shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless UND
    from all damages, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’
    fees) caused by or arising from CONTRACTOR’s unauthorized notification or disclosure of UND’s
    Confidential Information or Proprietary Information. As a condition to these indemnity obligations,
    UND will provide CONTRACTOR with prompt notice of any claim of which UND is aware and for
    which indemnification shall be sought under this Contract and shall cooperate in all reasonable
    respects with CONTRACTOR in connection with any such claim.
12. RIGHT OF SETOFF DAMAGES
    Amounts due UND by CONTRACTOR, including liquidated or other damages, or claims for
    damages, may be deducted or set-off by UND from any money payable to CONTRACTOR
    pursuant to this Contract.
13. RIGHT TO WITHHOLD AMOUNTS OTHERWISE DUE IF THE CONTRACTOR IS IN BREACH




                             T
    If CONTRACTOR fails to deliver Deliverables or to provide Services which satisfy CONTRACTOR’s
    obligations under this Contract, UND shall have the right to withhold any and all payments due
    under this Contract. UND may withhold any and all such payments due under this Contract to
    CONTRACTOR without penalty or work stoppage by CONTRACTOR, until such failure to perform
    is cured.             AF
14. RIGHT TO REMEDIES AND CUMULATION OF RIGHTS
    No remedy conferred by any of the specific provisions of the Contract is intended to be exclusive of
    any other remedy, and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every
    other remedy given under this Contract, now or in the future existing at law or in equity or by statute
    or otherwise.
15. NON-WAIVER
    Either party’s failure to exercise any of its rights under the Contract, its delay in enforcing any right,
    or its waiver of its rights on any occasion, shall not constitute a waiver of such rights on any other
    occasion. No course of dealing by either party in exercising any of its rights shall constitute a waiver
        R
    thereof. No waiver of any provision of the Contract shall be effective unless it is in writing and
    signed by the party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced.
16. INDEMNITY
    CONTRACTOR agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless UND, its officers and employees,
    from and against claims based on the vicarious liability of UND or its agents, but not against claims
D

    based on UND’s contributory negligence, comparative and/or contributory negligence or fault, sole
    negligence, or intentional misconduct. This obligation to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless does
    not extend to professional liability claims arising from professional errors and omissions. The legal
    defense provided by CONTRACTOR to UND under this provision must be free of any conflicts of
    interest, even if retention of separate legal counsel for UND is necessary. CONTRACTOR also
    agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold UND harmless for all costs, expenses and attorneys' fees
    incurred if UND prevails in an action against CONTRACTOR in establishing and litigating the
    indemnification coverage provided herein. This obligation shall continue after the termination of this
    Contract.
17. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
    CONTRACTOR represents and warrants to UND that neither CONTRACTOR, in connection with
    performing the services in performance of this Contract, nor the completed product delivered by
    CONTRACTOR, will infringe any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary right
    of any person. CONTRACTOR further represents and warrants to UND that it will not use any trade
                                                  Page 6 of 16
<Contract Name or Contract Reference Number>
    secrets or confidential or proprietary information owned by any third party in performing the services
    related to this Contract or in delivery of the completed product unless CONTRACTOR has the
    authority to license, use or provide those trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information to
    UND. CONTRACTOR further represents and warrants to UND that neither CONTRACTOR nor any
    other company or individual performing services pursuant to this Contract is under any obligation to
    assign or give any work done under this Contract to any third party.
18. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT INDEMNIFICATION
    a. CONTRACTOR, at its own expense, shall defend and indemnify UND against claims that
       products furnished under this Contract infringe a United States patent or copyright or
       misappropriate trade secrets protected under United States law.
    b. As to any product which is subject to a claim of infringement or misappropriation,
       CONTRACTOR may (a) obtain the right of continued use of the product for UND or (b) replace
       or modify the product to avoid the claim. If neither alternative is available on commercially
       reasonable terms then, at the request of CONTRACTOR, any applicable Software license and
       its charges will end, UND will stop using the product, and will return the product to




                             T
       CONTRACTOR. Upon return of the product, CONTRACTOR will give UND a credit for the price
       paid to CONTRACTOR, less a reasonable offset for use and obsolescence.

                          AF

21. PERSONNEL
    a. UND will designate a Project Manager to serve as the primary project manager for this Contract.
       If, during the course of the Contract, it becomes necessary for UND to change the person
       assigned as UND’s Project Manager, UND will notify CONTRACTOR in writing, pursuant to
       Notice section of this Contract.
    b. Unless UND otherwise notifies CONTRACTOR, UND’s Project Manager shall carry out UND’s
       administrative and management functions under this Contract, shall be responsible for
       acceptance of the Contract deliverables, and shall provide support and overall direction to
       CONTRACTOR.
    c. CONTRACTOR will designate a Project Manager and provide individuals to meet the
       requirements and accomplish the work as stated in this Contract including any mutually agreed
       upon Scope of Work.
    d. CONTRACTOR agrees and understands that UND’s execution of the Contract is predicated, in
       part and among other considerations, on the utilization of the specific individuals and personnel




                             T
       qualifications as identified; primary being <name of appropriate personnel, if applicable,>.
       Therefore, CONTRACTOR agrees that:
         1) Prior to assignment of personnel, CONTRACTOR shall obtain written approval from UND for
            all personnel to be assigned to this project
                          AF
         2) The personnel assigned must have the knowledge necessary to complete requirements as
            defined in the Contract.
         3) CONTRACTOR shall warrant that all personnel assigned to perform tasks in response to
            this Contract will remain assigned for the agreed-upon length of time.
         4) No replacement, reassignment or substitution of any assigned individuals and personnel
            qualifications shall be made without the prior written approval of UND and that such
            replacement, reassignment or substitution shall be made at no additional cost to UND.
         5) Any substitution made pursuant to this paragraph must be of equal or higher skills,
            knowledge, and abilities than those personnel originally proposed and that UND’s approval
            of a substitution is not construed as an acceptance of the substitution’s performance
         R
            potential. UND agrees that an approval of a substitution will not be unreasonably withheld.
         6) CONTRACTOR shall assign personnel on a full-time basis. In the event that a work
            assignment does not justify full-time participation, CONTRACTOR shall assign personnel on
            a part-time basis with prior written approval of UND’s Project Manager. However, if the part-
            time assignments are specified in the Contract, no written approval from UND’s Project
D

            Manager is necessary except for substitution of CONTRACTOR personnel.
    e. Upon request by UND, CONTRACTOR shall replace any CONTRACTOR personnel that UND
       determines, in its sole discretion, to be unable to perform the responsibilities of the Contract
       acceptably, e.g., inappropriate or unprofessional personal conduct, professional inabilities, etc.
    f.   UND 's working hours are Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM until 4:30 PM (CST or CDT)
         with one hour for lunch. UND Project Manager may approve alternate work schedules.
    g. According to UND policy, UND personnel are only obligated to work a forty-hour workweek,
       Monday through Friday, and are allowed reasonable vacation, sick and educational absences.
    h. CONTRACTOR’s personnel are not expected to work on State holidays or other mandatory
       leave days.

           description of the current status of the project, the tasks on which time was spent, the
           estimated progress to be made in the next reporting period, and the problems encountered




                             T
           the proposed solutions to them and their effect, if any, on the project budget/schedule.
        3) Project Variance Reporting – CONTRACTOR must provide data to allow UND’s project
           manager to calculate cost and schedule variance in accordance with N.D.C.C. § 54-35-15.2

                          AF
           exceeding 20%, a subsequent report must also provide proposed corrective measures to
           address the issues.
    b. Integrated Change Control Process
        CONTRACTOR and UND will utilize an integrated change control process to manage changes
        during the life of a project.
        1) A change request must be in writing to document the potential change. The write-up for the
           proposed change must be submitted to CONTRACTOR and UND’s project managers who
           will in turn provide it to relevant parties for assessment.
        2) All change requests will be logged and tracked. UND‘s project manager will record the
        R
           request in the project repository and will update the repository throughout the process.

           an estimate of the impact to cost, schedule, scope, and quality.
        4) CONTRACTOR will continue performing the services in accordance with the original
           Contract unless otherwise agreed upon by UND’s project manager. Work shall not
D

           commence on any new activities related to the change request until all parties agree in
           writing.
        5) CONTRACTOR’s project manager and UND’s project manager will adapt project plans to
           incorporate approved changes.
        6) Each change request duly authorized in writing by the parties shall be incorporated into and
           considered part of the Contract.
        7) During the course of the Contract, if CONTRACTOR determines or could reasonably
           determine any UND actions or directions constitute a requirement to perform additional
           work, CONTRACTOR shall notify UND within thirty (30) calendar days that UND has
           requested CONTRACTOR to perform additional work in the form of a change request
           utilizing the process above. CONTRACTOR understands that it waives the right to request
           additional time and reimbursable costs if CONTRACTOR fails to notify UND within thirty (30)

           acceptance testing will be performed on-site, on UND’s platform.
        2) Prior to acceptance testing, CONTRACTOR will furnish UND with documentation of the
           deliverable item, the expected performance, and agreed upon acceptance criteria.
        3) Upon completion of a deliverable or sub-deliverable, UND will have five (5) working days in
           which to accept or reject it in writing. UND will accept by signature. If UND rejects it, UND
           will specify in writing its grounds for rejection and CONTRACTOR shall use its best efforts to
           revise any issues for the deliverables to be acceptable to UND within the following five (5)
           working days. If UND rejects it a second time, UND will have the option of repeating the
           procedure as described in this acceptance statement above, escalating the issue to the
           Executive Steering Committee, or terminating this Contract upon written notice to
