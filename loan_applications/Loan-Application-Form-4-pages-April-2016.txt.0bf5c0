The information which is held on the ICB database relates to credit agreements between ICB members and their customers/members. A condition of
such agreements is that the customer agrees that the financial institution / Credit Union may use the data supplied for the purpose of credit checking.
Consequently, where an individual enters a credit agreement with an ICB member, details of the individual’s performance in complying with the terms
of the agreement are input to the ICB “credit file” database, which may be accessed by all member institutions of ICB. Each time a person applies for
credit from an ICB member, that institution accesses the ICB’s “credit file” to ascertain the applicant’s performance under any previous credit agreements
with ICB members.

3.      In addition to paragraphs 1 and 2 above, I further consent to and authorise the Credit Union to process and retain data provided by me in respect
of this application, to seek and provide credit references (searches), to record details of any transaction relating to a loan or other credit which may result
from this application with the Irish Credit Bureau (ICB) for a period of 5 years from the date of closure of the loan and ICB to record, retain and disclose
to its members details of such searches for a period of one year.

4.     I acknowledge that the Credit Union and/or the ICB are permitted to disclose any material misstatement of fact contained in the application for
financial accommodation to its members and relevant bodies. I consent to any such application being processed, recorded and retained by ICB.

Please note that you have the right to access personal data held about you by the Credit Union and to correct any inaccuracies in such data.
