  IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE:
  Submit bills for all charges except prescription drugs to Medicare first. Make sure you keep a copy of the itemized bill, since you will also need to submit it to SIHO.
  You will receive the Explanation of Benefits Statement from Medicare, indicating payment or denial of your claim submission. Submit the Medicare statement and a copy of itemized bill to SIHO.
  Some physicians and other medical providers will file your Medicare claims directly for you. You need to tell them to send you a copy of the itemized bill also, since you need to send it to SIHO
   once you receive Medicare’s Explanation of Benefits.
