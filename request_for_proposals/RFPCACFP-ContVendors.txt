  G. Proposal Protests
Any action which diminishes open and free competition seriously undermines the integrity of the procurement
process and may subject the Institution to proposal protests. Institutions are responsible for properly responding to
protests and concerns raised by potential contractors. Institutions must attach their proposal protest procedures to
their RFPs. Federal requirements and guidance do not relieve an organization of responsibility for its procurements or
its contracts. Institution must have protest procedures to handle and resolve disputes relating to procurement and must,
when requested, disclose information regarding the protest to FNS.

  H. Bonding Requi rements
Bid Guarantee: Proposals over $150,000, for goods and/or services, shall include a bid bond in the amount of_____%
of the proposal price.                                                     (Contracting Institution shall insert appropriate percentage
from 5% to 10% Contracting Institution should also insert this percentage on the RFP/Contract, Section E, #6. Only those
bonding and surety companies contained in the current Treasury Circular 570 may be used to obtain the required
bonding. The Treasury Circular is published annually for the information of Federal bond-approving officers and
person required giving bonds to the United States. All certificates of Authority expire June 30 and are renewable July 1,
annually. Bid bonds will be returned (a) to unsuccessful Bidders as soon as practical after the opening of proposals and
(b) to the successful Bidder upon execution of such further contractual documents and bonds as may be required by the
proposal as accepted.

firm, or person submitting a proposal for the same materials, supplies or equipment, and is in all respects fair and without
collusion or fraud. I agree to abide by all conditions of this proposal and certify that I am authorized to sign this proposal for
the Bidder and that the Bidder i s in compliance with all requirements of the Request for Proposal, including but not limited to,
certification requirements.

                             and Voluntary Exclusion - Lower Tier Covered Transactions


1.   By signing and submitting this certification, the prospective lower tier participant is providing the certification set out in
     accordance with these instructions.

2.   The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when this transaction
     was entered into. If it is later determined that the prospective lower tier participant knowingly rendered an erroneous
     certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or State Agency with
     which this transaction originated may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.

3.   The prospective lower tier participant shall provide immediate written notice to the person to whom this proposal is
     submitted if at any time the prospective lower tier participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted
     or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

4.   The terms “covered transaction,” “debarred," "suspended,” “ineligible,” “lower tier covered transaction,” “participant,”
     “person,” “primary covered transaction,” “principal," “proposal,” and “voluntarily excluded,” as used in this clause,
     have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage sections of rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You
     may contact the person to which this proposal is submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.

5.   The prospective lower tier participant agrees by submitting this form that, should the proposed covered transaction be
     entered into,it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction with a person who is debarred,
     suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized
     by the department or agency with which this transaction originated.

6.   The prospective lower tier participant further agrees by submitting this form that it will include this clause titled
     “Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion - Lower Tier Covered
     Transactions,” without modification, in all lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier
     covered transactions.

7.   A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered
     transaction that it is not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the covered transaction, unless it
     knows that the certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it determines the
     eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but is not required to, check the Nonprocurement List- www.elps.gov.

8.   Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render in
     goodfaith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information of a participant is not required to
     exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

9.   Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 5 of these instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction
     knowingly enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is suspended, debarred, ineligible, or
     voluntarily excluded from
     participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or
     State Agency with which this transaction originated may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or
     debarment.
