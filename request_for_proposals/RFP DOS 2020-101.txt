DOIT    or Agency     Funding
Background Information:

The Division of Emergency Services and Communications (DESC) is responsible for
processing all 9-1-1 calls made in the State of New Hampshire. The Next Generation 9-1-1
Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) is a system and service agreement that handles all
incoming 9-1-1 and administrative line calls into the Concord and Laconia Public Safety
Answering Points (PSAP).

The system is comprised of servers, workstations, monitors, and software licenses provided
by SolaCom for their Guardian product. The solution provided by the current vendor has
performed well. However, the warranty on the hardware as well as the software support on
the program licensing expires at the end of the contract. It is imperative that the DESC
enter into a contract that would replace and refresh all of the hardware in the current
system, as well as continue to contract for software maintenance and Tier 2 and Tier 3
technical support.

1. INTRODUCTION
The State of New Hampshire, acting through the Division of Emergency Services and
Communications (DESC), is releasing this Request for Proposal (RFP) in order to refresh the
Next Generation 9-1-1 Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) system and procure a new
service agreement for handling all incoming 9-1-1 calls originating inside the State of New
Hampshire as well as any administrative line calls into the Concord and Laconia Public Safety
Answering Points (PSAP).

   1.1 Project Overview
   The DESC is responsible for processing all 9-1-1 telephone calls and text messages made
   in the State of New Hampshire. The Next Generation 9-1-1 CPE is a system and service
   agreement that handles all incoming 9-1-1 and administrative line calls into the Concord
   and Laconia PSAPs.

   The current CPE is comprised of servers, workstations, monitors, peripheral devices and
   software licenses provided by SolaCom for their Guardian product. Guardian handles
   incoming calls, call distribution and call processing at an intelligent workstation level via
   the Guardian server call processing system. Additionally, Geo-Comm provides servers
   dedicated to pushing out GIS data and software to display mapping data at both PSAPs
   as well as each local dispatch center with a DESC workstation. Additionally, ECaTS
   provides a server and software for custom report generation based on information from
   the SolaCom Guardian servers. Lastly, the CPE also includes other incidental equipment
   such as PAC modules, Cisco switches, Border Control devices, FXO cards, large format
   display screens, and printers.

   The solution provided by the current vendor has performed well and the DESC would
   prefer to keep utilizing the current software. However, the warranty on the hardware as
   well as the software support on the program licensing expires at the end of the contract.
   It is recommended best practice that critical hardware be replaced at least every five
   years in order to meet 99.999% uptime requirements. Additionally, the DESC provides Tier
   1 support while the current vendor for this system provides system monitoring and Tier 2
   and 3 technical support. The DESC is looking for a vendor to replace all of the hardware,
   renew the SolaCom Software license maintenance agreement (or replace with new
   software), monitor the system and provide Tier 2 and Tier 3 technical support.

   1.2 Contract Award
   The State plans to execute a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract as a result of this RFP. If
   an award is made, it shall be made based upon evaluation of the submitted
   proposals in accordance with the review process outlined in Section 5 below. The
   award will be based upon criteria, standards, and weighting identified in this RFP.

                                  DESC - RFP 2020-101

   1.2.1 Non-Exclusive Contract
         Any resulting Contract from this RFP will be a non-exclusive Contract. The State
         reserves the right, at its discretion, to retain other Vendors to provide any of the
         Services or Deliverables identified under this procurement or make an award by
         item, part or portion of an item, group of items, or total Proposal.

   If a Contract is awarded, the Vendor must obtain written consent from the State
   before any public announcement or news release is issued pertaining to any Contract
   award. Such permission, at a minimum, will be dependent upon approval of the
   Contract by Governor and Executive Council of the State of New Hampshire. A
   Contract award is contingent on approval by the Governor and Executive Council.

1.3 Contract Term
   Time is of the essence in the performance of a Vendor’s obligations under the
   Contract.

   The Vendor shall be fully prepared to commence work by June 2020 after full
   execution of the Contract by the parties, and the receipt of required governmental
   approvals, including, but not limited to, Governor and Executive Council of the State
   of New Hampshire approval (“Effective Date”).

   The Vendor’s initial term will begin on the Effective Date and extend through June
   2025. The term may be extended up to two (2) years (“Extended Term”) at the sole
   option of the State, subject to the parties’ prior written agreement on applicable fees
   for each extended term, up to but not beyond June 2027. Pricing for the optional
   Extended Term must be provided by the Vendor as part of the proposal.

   The Vendor shall commence work upon issuance of a Notice to Proceed by the State.

   The State does not require the Vendor to commence work prior to the Effective Date;
   however, if the Vendor commences work prior to the Effective Date and a Notice to
   Proceed, such work shall be performed at the sole risk of the Vendor. In the event
   that the Contract does not become effective, the State shall be under no obligation
   to pay the Vendor for any costs incurred or Services performed; however, if the
   Contract becomes effective, all costs incurred prior to the Effective Date shall be paid
   under the terms of the Contract.

   1.3.1 Contract Negotiations and Unsuccessful Bidder Notice
        If a Vendor is selected, the State will notify the selected Vendor in writing of their
        selection and the State’s desire to enter into contract discussions. Until the State
        successfully completes discussions with the selected Vendor, all submitted
        Proposals remain eligible for selection by the State. In the event contract
        discussions are unsuccessful with the selected Vendor, the State reserves the right
        to open contract negotiations with the second highest scoring Vendor.

                                   DESC - RFP 2020-101

        In accordance with New Hampshire Statutes Chapter 21-G:37, no information
        shall be available to the public, the members of the general court or its staff,
        notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 91-A, concerning specific responses to this
        RFP. At the time of receipt of proposals, the Agency will post the number of
        responses received with no further information. No later than five (5) business days
        prior to submission of a contract to the Department of Administrative Services
        pursuant to this RFP, the Agency will post the name, rank or score of each
        proposer. In the event that the contract does not require Governor & Executive
        Council approval, the Agency shall disclose the rank or score of the Proposals at
        least 5 business days before final approval of the contract.

1.4 Subcontractors
    The Vendor shall identify all Subcontractors to be provided to deliver required Services
    subject to the terms and conditions of this RFP, including but not limited to, in
    Appendix H Section H-25: General Contract Requirements herein and Appendix H:
    State of New Hampshire Terms and Conditions of this RFP.

   The Vendor shall remain wholly responsible for performance of the entire Contract
   regardless of whether a Subcontractor is used. The State will consider the Vendor to
   be the sole point of contact with regard to all contractual matters, including payment
   of any and all charges resulting from any Contract.

    discretion, may extend the Proposal submission deadline, as it deems appropriate.

4.9 Confidentiality of a Proposal
    A Proposal must remain confidential until the Effective Date of any resulting Contract
    as a result of this RFP. A Vendor’s disclosure or distribution of Proposals other than to
    the State will be grounds for disqualification.

4.10 Public Disclosure
    Subject to applicable law or regulations, the content of each Vendor’s Proposal shall
    become public information upon the Effective Date of any resulting Contract.
    Any information submitted as part of a response to this request for proposal (RFP) may
    be subject to public disclosure under RSA 91-A. In addition, in accordance with RSA
    9-F:1, any contract entered into as a result of this RFP will be made accessible to the
    public        online        via        the        website         Transparent           NH
    (http://www.nh.gov/transparentnh/). Accordingly, business financial information
    and proprietary information such as trade secrets, business and financials models
    and forecasts, and proprietary formulas may be exempt from public disclosure under
    RSA 91-A:5, IV. If you believe any information being submitted in response to a
    request for proposal, bid or information should be kept confidential as financial or
    proprietary information, you must specifically identify that information in a letter to
    the agency, and should mark/stamp the materials as such. Marking of the entire
    Proposal or entire sections of the Proposal (e.g. pricing) as confidential will neither be
    accepted nor honored. Notwithstanding any provision of this RFP to the contrary,
    Vendor pricing will be subject to disclosure upon approval of the contract by
    Governor and Council.

    Generally, each Proposal shall become public information upon the approval of
    Governor and Council of the resulting contract, as determined by the State, including
    but not limited to, RSA Chapter 91-A (Right to Know Law). The State will endeavor to
    maintain the confidentiality of portions of the Proposal that are clearly and properly
    marked confidential. If a request is made to the State to view portions of a Proposal
    that the Vendor has properly and clearly marked confidential, the State will notify the
    Vendor of the request and of the date and the State plans to release the records. A
    designation by the Vendor of information it believes exempt does not have the effect
    of making such information exempt. The State will determine the information it
    believes is properly exempted from disclosure. By submitting a Proposal, Vendors
    agree that unless the Vendor obtains a court order, at its sole expense, enjoining the
    release of the requested information, the State may release the requested
    information on the date specified in the State’s notice without any liability to the
    Vendors.

4.11 Security
    The State must ensure that appropriate levels of security are implemented and
    maintained in order to protect the integrity and reliability of its information technology
    resources, information, and services. State resources, information, and services must
    be available on an ongoing basis, with the appropriate infrastructure and security

    data.

    The State will evaluate the degree to which the proposed System is designed and
    architected to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of its valued asset, Data.

    award a Contract. The State reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to reject any and
    all Proposals, or any portions thereof, at any time; to cancel this RFP; and to solicit new
    Proposals under a new acquisition process.

4.13 Proposal Preparation Cost
    By submitting a Proposal, a Vendor agrees that in no event shall the State be either
    responsible for or held liable for any costs incurred by a Vendor in the preparation of
    or in connection with the Proposal, or for work performed prior to the Effective Date
    of a resulting Contract.

4.14 Oral Presentations/Interviews and Discussion
    The State reserves the right to require Vendors to make oral presentations of their
    Proposals and/or to make available for oral presentations/interviews the IT consultants
    proposed to implement the COTS application. All costs associated with oral
    presentations/interviews shall be borne entirely by the Vendor. Vendors may be
    requested to provide demonstrations of their proposed Systems as part of their
    presentations.

    By submitting a Proposal, the Vendor agrees that the State of New Hampshire terms
    and conditions, contained in Appendix H: State of New Hampshire Terms and
    Conditions herein, shall form the basis of any Contract resulting from this RFP. In the
    event of any conflict between the State’s terms and conditions and any portion of
    the Vendor’s Proposal, the State’s terms and conditions shall take precedence and
    supersede any and all such conflicting terms and conditions contained in the
    Vendor’s Proposal.

5. PROPOSAL EVALUATION PROCESS

  5.1 Scoring Proposals
     Each Proposal will be evaluated and considered with regard to the Solution and
     Services proposed, qualifications of the Vendor and any Subcontractors, experience
     and qualifications of proposed candidates, and cost.

     If the State determines to make an award, the State will notify a selected Vendor
     based on these evaluations. Should the State be unable to reach agreement
     with the selected Vendor during Contract discussions, the State may then
     undertake Contract discussions with the second preferred Vendor and so on.
     Such discussions may continue at the sole option of the State, until an
     agreement is reached, or all Proposals are rejected.

     A Proposal Evaluation Team of State Employees: will independently evaluate and score
     the response to each item. There are three factors to the evaluation and scoring:

        1. Adherence to Mandatory Requirements (Pass/Fail): The Evaluation team will
           identify if the Vendor’s proposal meets the mandatory requirements as identified
           in the RFP. If the Vendor’s proposal does not meet all the mandatory
           requirements, the proposal will not be considered for further evaluation and
           scoring

        2. Evaluation of Technical Proposal: The Evaluation Team will review the Vendor’s
           responses to the criteria and standards as identified in Section 5.4.

     The scores for each section will be averaged and weighted by the associated
     Weighting Factors in the table below. The resulting product will be the item’s Raw
     Weighted Score.

     The total average score for all sections will be calculated and the resulting number will
     be compared against the average scores of all other proposals being evaluated.

        3. Cost Proposal - Vendor’s cost proposals will be given a weighted score based
           on thirty-five (35) maximum available points using the following formula:

     The combined scores from the Technical and Cost evaluations will be used to
     determine which Vendor’s proposal will be considered for intent to award.

5.2 Rights of the State in Evaluating Proposals
    The State reserves the right to:
         a. Consider any source of information including but not limited to: State
             employees, Internet research and rating agencies, in evaluating
             Proposals;
         b. Omit any planned evaluation step if, in the State’s view, the step is not
             needed;
         c. At its sole discretion, reject any and all Proposals at any time.

5.3 Planned Evaluations
    The State plans to use the following process:
          Initial screening:
          Preliminary scoring of the Proposals;
          Oral interviews and product demonstrations;
          Final evaluation of Proposals.

   5.3.1   Initial Screening
           The State will conduct an initial screening step to verify Vendor compliance with
           submission requirements and to confirm that the Proposal satisfies the conditions
           defined in Appendix B: Minimum Standards for Proposal Consideration. A
           Proposal that fails to satisfy either submission requirements or minimum standards
           may be rejected without further consideration.

   5.3.2   Preliminary Scoring of Proposals
           The State will establish an evaluation team to initially score Proposals.

   5.3.3   Oral Interviews and Product Demonstrations
           Preliminary scores from the initial evaluation of the Proposals will be used to
           select Vendors to invite to oral interviews and product demonstrations.

           The purpose of oral interviews and product demonstrations is to clarify and
           expound upon information provided in the written Proposals. Vendors are
           prohibited from altering the basic substance of their Proposals during the oral
           interviews and product demonstrations. Product demonstrations must include
           only existing core system functionality.

                                   DESC - RFP 2020-101

           For each invited Vendor, the oral interview and product demonstrations will be
           two (2) hours in length. A highly structured agenda will be used for oral interviews
           and product demonstrations to ensure standard coverage of each invited
           Vendor. Information gained from oral interviews and product demonstrations
           will be used to refine scores assigned from the initial review of the Proposals.

   5.3.4   Best and Final Offer
           The State will not be requesting a Best and Final Offer. The Proposal should be
           submitted initially on the most favorable terms which the Vendor can offer.

   5.3.5   Final Evaluation
           The State will conduct final evaluations as a culmination of the entire process of
           reviewing Vendor Proposals and information gathering. Reference and
           background checks will be made for finalist or finalists as appropriate. After
           making a preliminary determination of award, the State reserves the right to
           conduct site visits to a Vendor location and/or government site(s) that utilizes
           the Vendor Software.

5.4 Scoring Detail
    The State will select a Vendor based upon the criteria and standards contained in
    this RFP.

   5.4.1   Scoring of the Proposed System and Services to be provided
           The Vendor’s Proposed Solution and Services will be allocated a weighting of
           forty (40) points. The main purpose of this section is to measure how well the
           solution meets the business needs of the Agency. The contribution of scoring
           team members representing all stakeholders will be critical in this section.

           Factors include but are not limited to:

           Software Architecture - Scoring this aspect of the proposals will include: how well
           the solution will adapt to the organization (or does the organization have to
           adapt to it), How does it fit with the organization’s other products and business
           strategies? Can it adapt to future organizational changes? Does it support
           organizational technical strategies? Can it easily accommodate any planned
           or possible growth?

           Features - How well does the solution do the things the System needs to do?

           Compatibility with State Systems - The degree to which the System uses
           technologies similar to other State systems, ease of System modification,
           integration and data storage.

                                 DESC - RFP 2020-101

        User Friendliness/Usability and Efficiency - How quickly can users perform a
        needed task? How easy is it to learn, is it intuitive? Is its navigation and interface
        similar to other software used? How steep is the learning curve?

        Criteria for these scores will be found in but are not limited to:

              Proposal Section III: Responses to Requirements and Deliverables
               Attachment C: Requirements, particularly business requirements
              Proposal Section IV: Narrative Responses
              Vendor Presentation and Demonstration

5.4.2   Scoring of Vendor Technical, Service, and Project Management Approach
        The Vendor’s Technical, Service, and Project Management Approach will be
        allocated a weighting of fifteen (15) points. In this section the State will score the
        technical merits of how the Vendor proposes to carry out the implementation
        and maintain the solution. The Implementation of the Solution will require the
        Vendor to customize or configure the application to meet the requirements of
        the State, monitor and ensure its operation throughout the contract period and,
        if maintenance is to be provided, to be a partner in the Solution’s operation
        throughout its useful life. Technical details of the System, administrative
        procedures, how the Vendor manages its team, the project and the technical
        environment will be critical. How compatible the Vendor’s procedures and
        technologies are with the State contribute to an assessment of risk both in the
        short and long term.

        Factors include but are not limited to:

        Protection Against Cybersecurity Threats – The degree to which the Solution
        protects DESC call delivery streams, statistical call data and continuous
        operations against unexpected or malicious problems.

        Compatibility with State IT Expertise and Training Approach - What is the
        degree to which the System uses technologies which may be supported by
        State personnel.

        Project Execution - Do company procedures facilitate: communication with
        the State, the early discovery and resolution of problems, efficient and
        effective operation through Implementation and an effective support
        structure of the System.

        Project Management Competence - Administrative, management quality
        control and oversight.

        Ongoing Operations – Post warranty operation and support.

        Criteria for these scores will be found in but are not limited to:

5.4.3 Scoring of Vendor Company and Staffing Qualifications
      Vendor Company and Staffing Qualifications will be allocated a weighting of
      ten (10) points. It must be established that the Vendor company and staff is
      capable of carrying out the Project through Implementation, the Warranty
      Period and the Maintenance Period. Vendor Staff must have the training and
      experience to support the Vendor company’s plans to implement and support
      the System.

     Factors include but are not limited to:

     How long in business – A proven track record of operation for a number of years
     that the company will continue to support the System.

     How many years of experience with this product – Demonstrated competence
     in working with the proposed product or Technology.

     Bench Strength and support structures – The State will consider the depth of
     required technical skill within the company as well as the Vender’s plan for
     knowledge transfer to State staff.

     References - The measure of a company’s worth is more accurate when made
     by a third party that has collaborated with the Vendor on a similar project.

     Litigation – The relevance of involvement of the company in litigation will be
     considered.

     Financial Strength – Financial strength when measured by financial statements
     or a rating company is an indication of the company’s ability to operate long
     term and through unexpected problems.

     Staff Training – Staff must have relevant training to carry out the Project.

     Staff Certifications – Staff may require specific certification to support and
     configure needed equipment and software.

5.4.4   Scoring the Software Solution Cost
        Vendor proposed Software Solution cost will be allocated a weighting of
        thirty-five (35) points. The State will consider both Implementation and
        subsequent five (5) year license and maintenance costs, provided in Tables
        F-1: Deliverables Pricing Worksheet, F-4: Software Licensing, Maintenance,
        and Support Pricing Worksheet. The cost information required in a Proposal
        is intended to provide a sound basis for comparing costs.

        THE FOLLOWING FORMULA WILL BE USED TO ASSIGN POINTS FOR COSTS:

        Vendor’s Cost Score= (Lowest Proposed Cost / Vendor’s Proposed Cost)
        multiplied by weighting factor (35 points)

        For the purpose of this formula, the lowest proposed cost is defined as the lowest
        cost proposed by a Vendor who fulfills the minimum qualifications.

      APPENDIX A: BACKGROUND INFORMATION

A-1   Department of Safety/Division of Emergency Services and Communications

      The Division of Emergency Services and Communications (DESC) is responsible for
      providing residents and visitors with immediate emergency assistance when
      calling 9-1-1.

      The mission of the DESC is:

       “To locate, communicate, and connect people in an emergency with the help
                                      they need.”

      Project Overview

      The Division of Emergency Services and Communications (DESC) is responsible for
      processing all 9-1-1 calls made in the State of New Hampshire. The Next Generation
      9-1-1 CPE is a system and service agreement that handles all incoming 9-1-1 and
      administrative line calls into the Concord and Laconia PSAPs.

      The current CPE is comprised of servers, workstations, monitors, peripheral devices and
      software licenses provided by SolaCom for their Guardian product. Guardian handles
      incoming calls, call distribution and call processing at the workstation level.
      Additionally, Geo-Comm provides GIS software to display mapping data at both
      PSAPs as well as each local dispatch center with a DESC workstation. Furthermore,
      ECaTS provides a server and software for custom report generation based on
      information from the SolaCom Guardian servers. Lastly, the CPE also includes other
      incidental equipment such as PAC modules, Cisco switches, Border Control devices,
      FXO cards, large format display screens, and printers.

      The solution provided by the current vendor has performed well and the DESC would
      prefer to keep utilizing the current software. However, the warranty on the hardware
      as well as the software support on the program licensing expires at the end of the
      contract. It is recommended best practice that critical hardware be replaced at least
      every five years in order to meet 99.999% uptime requirements. Additionally, the DESC
      provides Tier 1 support while the current vendor for this system provides system
      monitoring and Tier 2 and 3 technical support. The DESC is looking for a vendor to

                                      DESC - RFP 2020-101

      A-2.1 Technical Architecture

              Components of the DESC’s technical architecture include:

             State Network Environment: The DESC operates multiple networks using
              various technologies including CAT6 fiber, dedicated lines, and wireless,
              Voice over IP (VoIP) and VPN technologies.

             Current CPE: The DESC currently utilizes a SolaCom Guardian platform in a
              split-core, geo-diverse configuration. One core is housed at the DESC
              facility in Concord and the other core is housed at the DESC facility in
              Laconia. Both locations are equipped with proxy and application servers
              to handle call distribution. The Vendor will be required to use industry-
              standard Border Control Functions (BCF) as well as utilizing Policy Routing
              Function (PRF) application software within the application servers to
              initiate the SIP session. The Vendor will be required to work with the DESC
              for any required integration with on-site resources.

      A-2.2 Next Gen 9-1-1 (NG 9-1-1)
            Design and development efforts shall conform to the latest, current Next Gen
            (NG) 9-1-1 standards and best practices. The DESC anticipates that an
            interstate level Emergency Services IP Network (ESINet) will be implemented in
            the future and will interconnect bordering state’s PSAPs. The Vendor will be
            required to accommodate this future development when it is implemented.

A-3   Related Documents Required
      Vendors are NOT required to submit the following certificates with their proposal,
      however the certificates WILL be requested from the selected Vendor prior to

APPENDIX C: SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES

C-1   SCOPE OF WORK

      The DESC requires a full hardware refresh of the CPE including servers,
      workstations, monitors, switches, firewalls, and any other devices required to
      process and handle calls, starting with the handoff from the Call Delivery
      Network to the distribution to the call processing workstation and finally to the
      transfer to the local dispatch center. This includes a private on-net VoIP phone
      system linking both Concord and Laconia PSAPs to dedicated VoIP phones at all
      dispatch centers. These phones are required in case of a phone system failure at
      the local level so that calls can be transferred directly from the CPE workstation.

      The DESC also requires a contract with a Vendor to extend the software licensing
      agreements on all CPE software required to operate the Guardian call
      processing system and all other software required to operate or monitor the CPE.
      Finally, the DESC requires a new five-year contract with a Vendor for system
      maintenance, Tier 2 and 3 technical support, extended hardware maintenance
      on all devices and live 24x7x365 monitoring of the system.

      The DESC will evaluate proposals for solutions other than SolaCom Guardian.
      However, as the DESC currently owns Guardian software licenses, Vendors
      proposing new systems that require additional or replacement software licenses
      will be evaluated the same as Vendors proposing a refresh of the current system
      in all areas, including cost.

      The winning Vendor will be responsible for purchasing, delivering and installing all
      hardware and performing all system configurations required for the CPE update.
      The Vendor will be expected to work closely with DESC IT and the call delivery
      network vendor for systems integration, upgrade scheduling and any software
      updates that are required.

      DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING SYSTEM

      See Appendix J for a diagram of the existing CPE system, call volume data, and
      current parts list.

      Current Systems Included in the CPE Project:

      1. SolaCom Guardian system utilizing 2 Guardian Controllers and 52 Intelligent
         Workstations.
      2. SolaCom Guardian Map for GIS functionality
      3. ECaTS reporting solution

      The winning vendor will be required to work closely with DESC IT to integrate
      required functionality into the proposed Solution that include but are not limited

to enhanced call taker capability, remote diagnostics, DESC CAD integration,
call recording systems and other systems designed to accept call data. The
Vendor will be required to provide NENA compliant delivery of ANI/ALI data to
both CAD and GIS applications to both locations independently. Delivery of the
ANI/ALI data shall occur natively via IP.

Current systems that integrate with the CPE but are outside of this project:

1. Exacom Hindsight G3 call recorders – Dual-server systems in both Concord
   and Laconia
2. Valor Mini-CAD – ANI/ALI transfer functionality to the local dispatch centers
   installed at 52 workstations.
3. 911Datamaster DataBond system – redundant ALI Servers installed in both
   Concord and Laconia.
4. 911Datamaster DataNexus system – redundant ECRF system that has been
   custom configured to return 6 values for each FindService Request (Primary
   and Secondary Police, Fire and Medical URIs)
5. Medical Priority Dispatch – This system is integrated with Valor Mini-CAD and is
   currently running Paramount Medical Protocol 13.2.1.

Current Call Delivery and Handling

The CPE systems in both the Concord and Laconia PSAP are integrated into the
DESC SIP call delivery network. The call delivery network is a fiber ring which
aggregates calls from two data centers located in Laconia and Manchester.

Incoming calls from the call delivery network are delivered to CPE equipment in
both locations and under normal conditions, the calls are evenly distributed.
Additionally, the DESC has a number of administrative POTS and Centrex lines in
both Concord and Laconia that ring at the Supervisors’ workstation or present as
a live 9-1-1 calls depending on the configuration.

The CPE equipment, including the servers and workstations, in Concord and
Laconia are integrated into the DESC Layer 3 network, which includes a 1 GB
fiber connection between both sites. Currently, the Guardian equipment running
Microsoft operating systems is either installed in a workstation configuration or is a
member of a dedicated domain for the PSAPs. Both Concord and Laconia are
configured in a single ring group and incoming calls are distributed to the
longest-idle call taker, regardless of physical location. Additionally, the DESC
Training Room is configured in a separate ring group to prevent live calls from
being delivered during times of call queuing.

All 9-1-1 calls placed in New Hampshire are distributed to one of the DESC’s two
PSAPs. Once the call is answered at one of these PSAPs, the nature of the
emergency is determined, and data is transferred to the appropriate local
dispatch center for the caller’s location and emergency type utilizing Valor

MiniCAD. This data is passed via TCP/IP over the DESC’s CE Network. The voice is
then transferred separately to the appropriate local dispatch agency via the
PSTN or on-net to dedicated DESC VoIP phones. Additional resources may be
notified as required. Those callers in need of medical assistance receive verbal
Emergency Medical Dispatch instructions from a DESC PSAP call taker.

The DESC currently utilizes Guardian Map for GIS functionality in the PSAP and a
proprietary GIS solution at the dispatch centers.

Goals and Objectives for NG 9-1-1 CPE Refresh:

   A new 5-year contract for Tier 2 and 3 technical support, software
    maintenance, and system monitoring
   Refreshed Hardware (Servers, workstations, etc.) with 5-year maintenance
   Refreshed Software (Operating systems, custom CPE solution software, existing
    software maintenance agreement renewed, etc.)
   Integration of the System with pre-existing components
   Complete Management Information System (MIS) for the System
   Implementation
   Training
   Support during and after cutover
   Modern technologies that can migrate to the technologies of tomorrow
   Smooth transition to new System through effective change management

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

Overview

The DESC requires that the proposed System be an IP-based solution which
integrates directly with the Layer 3 network managed by DESC IT. Designated
subnets for Concord and Laconia CPE equipment will be provided to the
winning Vendor. All networking equipment that is part of this System is required to
be configured to match the VLANs of the DESC’s network. Additionally, the DESC
strongly prefers that the new system be integrated with the existing DESC IT
infrastructure as closely as possible for functions such as server image backups.
The Vendor will be expected to work with DESC IT on the details of this integration
to provide stability, reliability as well as a speedy disaster recovery path.

All 9-1-1 calls presented to the CPE from the call delivery network will be in SIP
format. The Vendor must include appropriate Border Control Functions (BCF) to
accept these calls from the call delivery network. The Solution must include a
Legacy Network Gateway (LNG), which will query the ALI server for the location
for all incoming calls.

                                DESC - RFP 2020-101

By default, the Solution should distribute incoming calls via ACD utilizing the
longest-idle algorithm, but the Solution should also have the ability for rules-
based call distribution.

For all incoming 9-1-1 calls, the Solution must have the ability to interface with the
DESC’s ALI and ECRF databases in a geo-redundant manner. The System must
have the ability to handle the customized ECRF FindService response which
includes six (6) dispatch center URIs representing both Primary and Secondary
information for Police, Fire and Medical emergencies. The Solution must have the
ability to present this information in a logical manner that allows the call taker to
expediently transfer the call.

While one-button transfers are the preferred method, the Solution must also
provide a contact list which is easily searchable. This list must be able to include
both traditional PSTN 10-digit transfers as well an on-net transfers to the
dedicated emergency VoIP phone system. These phones are used in cases
when the dispatch center’s primary phone system is unavailable.

The System must be secure and built on open standards so that interoperability
with other industry standard systems and networks is assured. It shall be
compatible with our existing vendors and systems. The Vendor must also be
willing to work with the DESC in the future on migrating the current GIS solution to
a browser-based proprietary GIS solution, if requested.

The Answering Positions shall consist of a high-end workstation that is capable of
answering and processing both emergency and administrative calls. The CPE
software shall be responsible for all call-related functionality such as call
answering, call transfers, ANI/ALI display and other call processing functions on
both 911 and administrative circuits. In addition, the high-end workstations shall
be capable of running ancillary software such as supplemental ALI, GIS map
display and search functionality, and the transfer of CAD data via a dedicated
CAD application. The high-end workstations must be capable of processing
these applications and must include multiple displays.

All relevant portions of the proposed solution shall conform to the applicable
NENA i3 standards. The System must, at a minimum, provide call-handling
capabilities to support the same volume of call traffic as the current system at
peak volume. Additionally, the System must demonstrate the ability to
accommodate potential future growth, if demands required. The DESC requires
the ability and approval to install third party software such as ProQA and Valor
MiniCAD that are required to provide full functionality.

The DESC is also requesting some functionality that is above and beyond the
current system. The Vendor will be required to configure the DESC training room
as a full testing environment including a dedicated 10-digit number that will
simulate a live 9-1-1 call.

                                DESC - RFP 2020-101


The Vendor will also be required to integrate with Enhanced Location Data
services as requested. As of the publication date of this RFP, the only vendor with
those capabilities is RapidSOS and the Vendor will be required to directly
connect to the Rapid Portal. However, for the length of the contract, the Vendor
will be required to connect with additional ELD service providers if/when they
become available.

The DESC requests that the Vendor provide quotes for an optional disaster
recovery mobile PSAP. The DESC operates an Incident Management Vehicle
and an Incident Management Trailer, both of which are capable of being
deployed in the field and being operational for an extended period of time. The
DESC requests that the Vendor propose as an optional component of five (5)
mobile CPE workstations which can connect to the DESC’s network via VPN.
These mobile CPE workstations could be deployed during a disaster and be able
to fully process 9-1-1 calls utilizing all of the functionality provided by either the
Vendor or the DESC.

The DESC is also interested in an optional replacement of the 911Datamaster
ECRF system. Any replacement that is proposed should be geo-redundant,
hosted locally in the DESC Concord and Laconia offices and capable of
returning 6 URI values for a single FindService request.

Redundancy

The architecture of the System shall be such that the failure of any one
component or module will not result in system failure, but only the loss of the
equipment associated with that module. All vital system modules must have
redundant modules configured in an active-active configuration to protect
against any single point of failure. It is mandatory that any central processor and
audio switching matrix shall be fully duplicated in an active-active configuration.
Failover shall be automatic, lossless, and shall not require manual intervention.
All major components proposed in the System should be geographically
redundant allowing for dual-locality of all mission-critical components of the
System. No single major component failure shall disable more than fifty (50)
percent of the System capacity. The System shall provide the ability to “make
busy” or manually shut down one PSAP, forcing all requests for service to be
directed to the other PSAP. This will allow for troubleshooting, training, and
maintenance as required.

The DESC would also be interested in an optional upgrade to the server
environment to increase redundancy and availability.

The Solution will be required to interface with several existing DESC-operated
system in support of call handling.

The proposed system shall support multiple ALI database connections, as
needed in a geo-redundant fashion on dedicated redundant data links to the
third party ALI database provider. Requests to the ALI database but be returned
immediately when ANI is received. If an ALI failure is returned, or the result fails,
the system shall have to ability to re-submit the request and in the event of an
incorrect ALI, there will be an ability to capture the discrepancy details. The
winning vendor is required to work with the DESC current ALI/Database provider
for integration configuration.

Please detail the Solution’s interfaces for the above systems.

Topic 4 – Call Transfer and Conference Abilities
Response Page Limit: 2

All calls must have the ability to be transferred to agencies via the PSTN and
configured in a pre-defined list as well as with a manual ten-digit dial. Six (6)
“Speed Dial” buttons or Selective Transfer buttons should be populated for
Police, Fire and Medical (both Primary and Secondary agencies) calls
automatically based on the location of the 9-1-1 call cross-referenced with the
DESC’s dispatch center coverage polygons. The DESC provides an ECRF for the
purposes of determining the correct dispatch center if needed for The System.
The System should also have the capability of transferring a call via SIP via the
ESINet if so configured.

The PSAP equipment shall have the ability to route a call to an on-site or remote
location using a single keystroke. The transfer must be capable of transferring ALI
information of the original caller. It must provide the telecommunicator the ability
to remain on a call and add a new party to the conversation. Any party shall be
able to drop out of the conference, leaving the others talking as long as at least
one of the other parties possesses supervision on their connection. Conferences
should be set up using a single key-stroke without putting the caller on hold - the
caller must remain on-line at all times. The System shall allow for up to 10 parties to
be placed in a conference simultaneously.

Please describe in detail the how the system handles call transfers in these
scenarios.

Topic 5 – Call Delivery Features
Response Page Limit: 2

Most calls will be provided via SIP by the 9-1-1 Telephone Network Aggregator
and delivered alternatingly to Concord and Laconia. A small percentage of calls
will be delivered in analog format via POTS or Centrex lines. Call delivery shall be
configurable for routing calls based on geography or availability or both. All
incoming traffic from the call delivery network will be in SIP format, but calls
coming in from POTS or Centrex lines will need to be converted to SIP.

      What is the maximum number of simultaneous calls allowed in the
       Solution?

Please describe how the Solution will handle incoming calls, establishing SIP
session, creating multiple connections (when transferring to a dispatch center for
example) and how call tear down is handled.

Topic 6 – Automated Call Distribution (ACD)
Response Page Limit: 2

The PSAP equipment shall contain an on-site, intelligent call distribution system. The
ACD shall contain the ability to provide seamless integration between the two
primary PSAPs in Concord and Laconia. The ACD should combine both PSAP’s
agents into one virtual ACD. The incoming request for emergency services queue,
in conjunction with the selected ACD scheme, presents the incoming request for
emergency services to the next call-taker in the same order that the incoming
request for emergency services was received. In the event of a failure or
interruption of service for the “Virtual ACD” both PSAP’s ACDs should have the
ability to operate independently. PSAP managers shall have the ability to
customize voice messages and select from several different 9-1-1 call ACD
schemes, including:

      Longest idle
      Longest idle with alerting chime
      Predetermined Priority
      Ring All Telecommunicators
      No ACD
      Skill or Role-based call routing

All five ACD schemes ensure that no two calls with the same ANI are placed in the
call waiting queue at the same time, thereby assuring that hang-ups and hoax, or
“prank”, calls do not tie-up incoming trunks. A separate series of ACD queues,
which are First-In First-Out (FIFO), shall be available for incoming administration
calls.

Provide a detailed description of how the proposed Solution complies with these
requirements.

Topic 7 – Main Screen Requirements and Configurability
Response Page Limit: 3

The main screen shall consist at a minimum of the following components: Menu
Bar, Toolbar, Status Bar, Call Information Window, Conference Window, Static
Page Window, Multiple Page Window, Keypad, Volume Control Window,
Selective Transfer Agencies Window, Texting Window and TTY Interface Window.
The keypad shall be used to dial telephone numbers or to input numbers as
required. The keypad shall also provide access to the speed dial list and offer a
redial function. The telecommunicator shall have the capability to select a redial
number from a drop down list on the keypad. The list shall contain the last
numbers dialed at the answering position with the most recent number
appearing at the top of the list.

                                DESC - RFP 2020-101


The main screen shall permit customization of the user interface, including window
and button layout, window sizes, control element sizes and properties, font size and
types on a per console UI layout basis. The console shall support the assignment of
one or multiple console UI layouts and configuration based on the agent role
within an agency. The Supervisor shall have the capability to modify the System
sounds and button icons. The Supervisor shall have the capability to restore the
original screen layout while making modifications.

      In general, what are the customization abilities to the call-answering platform
       of the Solution?
      Will DESC staff be able to customize the user interface, including window and
       button layout, window sizes, control element sizes, control element sizes such
       as font sizes and types on a per console UI basis?
      Will the console support the assignment of one or multiple console UI layouts
       and configuration based on the agent role within an agency?
      Will DESC staff have the ability to restore the original screen layout?
      If not, how will DESC staff make these requests?

Please describe your main screen functionality.

Topic 8 – Text Messaging
Response Page Limit: 2

The System shall accept text messaging integrated to the call taker’s station. When
the call taker is presented with a text message emergency service request they
must become unavailable to any other form of requests for service such as voice
calls. Conversely, if they are currently active with a voice call they will not be
presented with a text message. The System shall have similar abilities to handle a
text message request for emergency assistance as it does for a voice request such
as GIS functionality. All other normal call handling functions supported for voice
calls should also be supported for text messaging such as the ability to join the call
or monitor the call, previous call history, reporting, etc.

Describe how the proposed System supports emergency text messaging and
transferring or conferencing text messages to another PSAP or a local dispatch
center.

Topic 9 – i3 Logger
Response Page Limit: 4

The Bidder shall provide a comprehensive Management and Reporting (MIS)
solution which will provide PSAP management and other authorized personnel
historical information. It shall be an on-site solution, user customizable and capable
of generating reports for varying time periods. In addition to static reporting
capabilities, the MIS solution should provide a dynamic reporting capacity which

                               DESC - RFP 2020-101

would allow for custom groups, filters and unique totals for defined reports. The MIS
solution should have traditional management and reporting capabilities that are
industry standard but should also be forward focused and have an enterprise
capability. The reporting capability shall be system-wide, as well as by individual
PSAP, individual position, shift, or a specific telecommunicator.

The PSAP equipment shall have the ability to provide call detail records after every
terminated 9-1-1 call. The record should include but should not be limited to ANI,
seizure time, position answered, answer time, disconnect time, incoming trunk
number, etc. These should be in a report format, as opposed to raw data format.
This information should automatically be saved as an electronic file in daily and/or
monthly formats for permanent storage. Call Detail Records should be retrievable
by the ANI or any other “key-word” search in the record. The vendor is responsible
for migrating any data from the current MIS platform, working with the current MIS
provider if necessary. The Vendor is required to maintain all legacy data into the
new system and is responsible for incurring any costs associated with the migration.

      Provide a list of the reports and capabilities standard with the proposed
       System.
      Describe the technology used by the proposed System.
      Describe what capabilities the i3 solution has regarding integration and
       support for next generation media types.
      The System should be able to incorporate reporting data and transfer times
       from other integrated systems. How does proposed solution accomplish
       this?
      Describe how the proposed System allows for the archiving and retrieval of
       historical data.

Topic 10 – Additional Features, Software, Hardware, or Services
Response Page Limit: 6

While the DESC currently owns and operates an ECRF by 911Datamaster, the DESC
would consider an option to the Solution that would replace this system. The DESC
does require that any replacement have the ability to be able to return six (6) URI
values for each FindService request. The ECRF must be able to be incorporated
into the DESC VMware cluster environment, be geographically redundant, and
also have the ability to easily provision new GIS data on a regular basis. Please
describe in detail the functionality of this optional replacement system.

The DESC is also interested in an optional, more robust Supplemental ALI (SupALI)
component that is focused on additional medical information. The SupALI
component must be able to display, at a minimum, several lines of additional
information such as medical issues, electricity requirements, mobility concerns,
etc. This information must be able to be stored on “per-phone-number” basis and
it is desired that this information can also be geographically tied to an address for
visual display on a map for the purposes of indicating that an issue exists at an

      address, regardless of the phone used to report the emergency. The SupALI system
      must have an administration program that allows for new entries, modification of
      existing entries and deletion of old entries. This administration program must also
      be able to produce reports on the age of the record, when it was entered, when
      it was modified and when the data was last verified. A self-registration website is
      desired for users to be able to submit their supplemental information to the DESC,
      conditional upon approval of this information by DESC staff. Please describe in
      detail the functionality of this optional system.

      The DESC is also interested in proposals for more robust high availability
      configurations for servers in the Solution. Please describe any optional
      configurations that are available to increase the reliability of the server
      environment.

      The vendor is responsible for migrating any data from the current SupALI platform,
      working with the current SupALI provider if necessary. The Vendor is required to
      maintain all legacy data into the new system and is responsible for incurring any
      costs associated with the migration.

      Please describe in detail the functionality of this optional configuration.

APPENDIX G-1 TESTING REQUIREMENTS

All testing and acceptance addressed herein shall apply to testing the System. This shall
include planning, test scenario development, Data, and System preparation for testing, and
execution of unit testing, System integration testing, conversion/migration testing, installation
testing, performance, and stress testing, Security review and testing, and support of the State
during User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

   G-1.1 Test Planning and Preparation
          The overall Test Plan will guide all testing. The Vendor provided, State approved,
          Test Plan will include, at a minimum, identification, preparation, and
          Documentation of planned testing, a requirements traceability matrix, test
          variants, test scenarios, test cases, test scripts, test Data, test phases, unit tests,
          expected results, and a tracking method for reporting actual versus expected
          results as well as all errors and problems identified during test execution.

          It is crucial that client training and testing activities not be abbreviated in order to
          meet Project Implementation Schedules. Therefore, the State requires that the
          testing activities be represented both in terms of effort and duration.

          Vendors must disclose in their proposals the scheduling assumptions used in regard
          to the Client resource efforts during testing.

          State testing will commence upon the Vendor Project Manager’s certification, in
          writing, that the Vendor’s own staff has successfully executed all prerequisite
          Vendor testing, along with reporting the actual testing results, prior to the start of
          any testing executed by State staff.

          The State will commence its testing within five (5) business days of receiving
          Certification from the Vendor that the State’s personnel have been trained and
          the System is installed, configured, complete, and ready for State testing. The
          testing will be conducted by the State in an environment independent from the
          Vendor’s development environment. The Vendor must assist the State with testing
          in accordance with the Test Plan and the Work Plan, utilizing test and live Data to
          validate reports, and conduct stress and performance testing, at no additional
          cost.

   G-1.2 Testing
         Testing begins upon completion of the Software configuration as required and
         user training according to the Work Plan. Testing ends upon issuance of a letter of
         UAT Acceptance by the State.

          Vendor must demonstrate that their testing methodology can be integrated with
          the State standard methodology.

 Unit Testing      Application components are tested on an individual basis to verify that
                the inputs, outputs, and processing logic of each application component
                functions without errors. Unit Testing is performed in either the development
                environment or a testing environment.

                   The goal is to find errors in the smallest unit of Software. If successful,
               subsequent integration testing should only reveal errors related to the
               integration between application components.
 System        a.) Validates the integration between the individual unit application
 Integration   components and verifies that the new System meets defined requirements
 Testing       and supports execution of interfaces and business processes. The Systems
               Integration Test is performed in a test environment.
               b.) Emphasizes end-to-end business processes and the flow of information
               across applications. It includes all key business processes and interfaces’
               being implemented, confirms data transfers with external parties, and
               includes the transmission or printing of all electronic and paper documents.
              c.) The State will conduct System Integration Testing, utilizing scripts
              developed, as identified in the Test Plan, to validate the functionality of
              the System and its interfaces. The State will also use System Integration
              Testing to validate modifications, fixes and other System interactions with
              the Vendor supplied Software Solution.
 Conversion       The Conversion/Migration Validation Testing should replicate the entire
 /Migration   flow of the converted data through the Software Solution. As the Software
 Validation   Solution is interfaced to legacy or third-party applications, the testing verifies
 Testing      that the resulting converted legacy data performs correctly.
                  Application components are installed in the System test environment to
 Installation test the installation routines and are refined for the eventual production
 Testing      environment. This activity serves as a dry run of the installation steps in
              preparation for configuring the production System.
User                The User Acceptance Test (UAT) is a verification process performed in a
Acceptance copy of the production environment. The User Acceptance Test verifies
Testing (UAT) System functionality against predefined Acceptance criteria that support the
               successful execution of approved business processes.
                   a.) The Vendor’s Project Manager must certify in writing, that the Vendor’s
               own staff has successfully executed all prerequisite Vendor testing, along with
               reporting the actual testing results prior to the start of any testing executed
               by State staff.
                    b.) The State will be presented with a State approved Test Plan, test
               scenarios, test cases, test scripts, test data, and expected results, as well as
               written Certification of the Vendor’s having completed the prerequisite tests,
               prior to the State staff involvement in any testing activities.
                    c.) UAT will also serve as a performance and stress test of the System. It
               may cover any aspect of the new System, including administrative
               procedures such as backup and recovery. The results of the UAT provide

                defined in the Work Plan.
                   d.) Upon successful conclusion of UAT and successful System deployment,
               the State will issue a letter of UAT Acceptance and the respective Warranty
               Period shall commence as described in Section H-25.11.1: Warranty Period.
Performance Vendor shall develop and document hardware and software configuration
Tuning and      and tuning of System infrastructure as well as assist and direct the State’s
Stress Testing System Administrators and Database Administrators in configuring and tuning
                the infrastructure to support the software throughout the project

              Performance Tuning and Stress Testing
               Scope
                 The scope of performance testing shall measure the system level metrics
                 critical for the development of the applications infrastructure and
                 operation of the applications in the production environment. It will include
                 the measurement of response rates of the application for end-user
                 transactions and resource utilization (of various servers and network) under
                 various load conditions. These response rates shall become the basis for
                 changes and retesting until optimum system performance is achieved.

                 The application transactions shall be identified with specific roles and
                 selected transactions shall be recorded for the performance
                 measurements. These will be compared to baselines to determine if object
                 and/or system performance increases as changes are made.

                 Performance testing shall consider the full scope of the application
                 infrastructure with emphasis on the most heavily used or shared
                 transactions. Performance testing of the application will profile the
                 identified user transactions and assist in the identifying performance gaps
                 to improve the most critical parts of the applications.

                 Performance testing and tuning shall occur in the final production
                 environment and shall use a copy of the final production database to
                 provide the best results.

                 Vendor must lead this effort. Responsibilities include identifying appropriate
                 tunable parameters and their default and recommended settings,
                 developing scripts, which accurately reflect business load and
                 coordinating reporting of results.

                Test types
                 Performance testing shall use two different types of tests to determine the
                 stability of the application. They are baseline tests and load tests

 Baseline Tests: Baseline tests shall collect performance data and load
 analysis by running scripts where the output is broken down into business
 transactions or functions. The test is like a single user executing a defined
 business transaction. During baseline testing, each individual script is run to
 establish a baseline for transaction response time, throughput and other
 user-based metrics. Usually each business transaction is executed multiple
 times during a single test run to obtain an average for the user-based metrics
 required for the performance testing evaluations. It must be noted that
 changes made to the code after baseline testing is completed will skew the
 results collected to date. All effort will be made to provide a code test base
 that is tested in the environment for problems prior to the establishment of
 the baseline, which are used in future testing and tuning efforts. Any
 changes introduced into the environment after performance testing has
 started can compromise the accuracy of the results and will force a
 decision to be made whether baseline results need to be recreated.

 Load Tests: Load testing will determine if the behavior of a system can be
 sustained over a long period       of time while running under expected
 conditions. Load tests helps       to verify the ability of the application
 environment under different         load conditions based on workload
 distribution. System response        time and utilization is measured and
 recorded.

Tuning
 Tuning will occur during both the development of the application and load
 testing. Tuning is the process whereby the application performance is
 maximized. This can be the result of making code more efficient during
 development as well as making tuning parameter changes to the
 environment.

 For infrastructure tuning, parameters will be identified for all components
 prior to undertaking the load testing efforts. This should include a list of the
 variables, their definitions, the default settings, range of acceptable settings
 and the settings as testing begins. This will permit the team to identify the
 areas of most potential gain and a starting point. Tuning is a process which
 is repeated until the team feels that the systems are running at or near
 optimum performance.

Implementing Performance and Stress Test
 Performance and Stress Test Tools must be provided by the Vendor for this
 effort. Consideration must be given to licensing with respect to continued
 use for regression testing. If the Vendor is familiar with open source low/no
 cost tools for this purpose those tools should be identified in your response.

  Vendor shall perform test planning. The steps for planning include
 identification of application functionality as well as what percentage of
 normal daily use is represented by each function. This information will
 become the foundation for scripting so that tests closely represent what
 loads in production will look like.

 Vendor shall provide definition and expectations from testing. This definition
 should include who is in charge of testing and coordinating results,
 anticipated run times, logs required for tracking, their locations and which
 technician is responsible to track and provide them following each test to
 the team.

 Initial test runs shall be completed to establish that the tests and data sets
 can be run to completion without errors. The ratio of types of transactions
 which makeup the test shall be reviewed prior to the beginning of testing
 and then again once testing has begun to make sure that testing
 accurately reflects the system performing in production.

 Initial tests shall be used to establish a baseline from which all subsequent
 tests will be compared. Tests will be considered for baseline status once two
 of them have been run within 2% of each other in key and overall
 performance areas. No changes to the test scripts or data sets (with the
 exception of restores after each test) can be done to the test environment
 once tuning has begun so as to not damage the comparison to baseline
 results. The systems must be restarted prior to each test run to assure all
 cache is cleaned out. All effort will be made to run these tests at a time
 when system and network infrastructure utilization doesn’t impact the
 results. Tests will be run in close proximity to our infrastructure to eliminate
 the public network from our environment.

 Post-test reporting and result assessment will be scheduled following each
 test. The team will compare these results to the baseline and a
 determination must be made to make additional changes to the
 parameter being tuned or return to the prior configuration and select
 another parameter to tune while keeping in mind that significant changes
 to any one parameter may require the retesting of some others. Careful
 work on identifying dependencies up front should minimize this impact.

 If defects are identified in the application during testing, they will be
 recorded; however, changes to the application code should be avoided
 if possible so as not to affect baseline comparisons. If a change to the
 application is required new baselines will be established (and possibly the
 execution of prior tests to validate changes with the new application)
 before testing can continue.

              When performing capacity testing against a GUI the focus will be on the
              ability of the interface to respond to user input.

              During stress/load testing the tester will attempt to stress or load an aspect
              of the system to the point of failure. The goal being to determine weak
              points in the system architecture. The tester will identify peak load
              conditions at which the program will fail to handle required processing
              loads within required time spans.

              During Performance testing the tester will design test case scenarios to
              determine if the system meets the stated performance criteria (i.e. A Login
              request shall be responded to in 1 second or less under a typical daily load
              of 1000 requests per minute.). In both cases, the tester will determine the
              capacity of the system under a known set of conditions.

Regression         As a result, of the user testing activities, problems will be identified that
Testing      require correction. The State will notify the Vendor of the nature of the testing
             failures in writing. The Vendor will be required to perform additional testing
             activities in response to State and/or user problems identified from the testing
             results.
                   Regression testing means selective re-testing to detect faults introduced
             during the modification effort, both to verify that the modifications have not
             caused unintended adverse effects, and to verify that the modified and
             related (possibly affected) System components still meet their specified
             requirements.
                   a.) For each minor failure of an Acceptance Test, the Acceptance
             Period shall be extended by corresponding time defined in the Test Plan.
                   b.) The Vendor shall notify the State no later than five (5) business days
             from the Vendor’s receipt of written notice of the test failure when the Vendor
             expects the corrections to be completed and ready for retesting by the
             State. The Vendor will have up to five (5) business days to make corrections
             to the problem unless specifically extended in writing by the State.
                   c.) When a programming change is made in response to a problem
             identified during user testing, a regression Test Plan should be developed by
             the Vendor based on the understanding of the program and the change
             being made to the program. The Test Plan has two objectives:
                         1. Validate that the change/update has been properly
                             incorporated into the program; and
                         2. Validate that there has been no unintended change to the
                             other portions of the program.

                  d.) The Vendor will be expected to:
                        1. Create a set of test conditions, test cases, and test data that will
                            validate that the change has been incorporated correctly;

                         2. Create a set of test conditions, test cases, and test data that will
                             validate that the unchanged portions of the program still
                             operate correctly; and
                         3. Manage the entire cyclic process.
                   e.) The Vendor will be expected to execute the regression test, provide
              actual testing results, and certify its completion in writing to the State prior to
              passing the modified Software application to the users for retesting.

              In designing and conducting such regression testing, the Vendor will be
              required to assess the risks inherent to the modification being implemented
              and weigh those risks against the time and effort required for conducting the
              regression tests. In other words, the Vendor will be expected to design and
              conduct regression tests that will identify any unintended consequences of
              the modification while taking into account Schedule and economic
              considerations.

              In their Proposals, Vendors must acknowledge their responsibilities for
              regression testing as described in this section.
Security       IT Security involves all functions pertaining to the securing of State Data and
Review         Systems through the creation and definition of security policies, procedures
and Testing    and controls covering such areas as identification, authentication and non-

              security testing. Tests shall focus on the technical, administrative and physical
              security controls that have been designed into the System architecture in
              order to provide the necessary confidentiality, integrity and availability. Tests
              shall, at a minimum, cover each of the service components. Test procedures
              shall include 3rd party Penetration Tests (pen test) or code analysis and
              review.

                   Prior to the System being moved into production, the Vendor shall
              provide results of all security testing to the Department of Information
              Technology for review and acceptance. All Software and hardware shall be
              free of malicious code (malware).
Penetration   a.) Implement a methodology for penetration testing that includes the

                      Includes coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems
                      Includes testing from both inside and outside the network
                      Includes testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction
                       controls
                      Defines application-layer penetration tests to include, at a minimum,
                       the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.5
                      Defines network-layer penetration tests to include components that
                       support network functions as well as operating systems
                      Includes review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities
                       experienced in the last 12 months

significant infrastructure or application upgrade or modification (such as an
operating system upgrade a sub-network added to the environment, or a
web server added to the environment).

d.) Exploitable vulnerabilities found during penetration testing are corrected
and testing is repeated to verify the corrections.

e.) If segmentation is used to isolate the CDE from other networks, perform
penetration tests at least annually and after any changes to segmentation
controls/methods to verify that the segmentation methods are operational
and effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from in-scope systems.

     The Vendor shall not change key Vendor staff and Project Manager commitments
     (collectively referred to as “Project Staff”) unless such replacement is necessary due to
     sickness, death, termination of employment, or unpaid leave of absence. Any such
     changes to the Vendor’s Project Staff shall require the prior written approval of the State.
     Replacement Project Staff shall have comparable or greater skills with regard to
     performance of the Project as the staff being replaced and be subject to the provisions
     of this RFP and any resulting Contract.

     The State, at its sole expense, may conduct reference and background checks on the
     Vendor’s Project Staff. The State shall maintain the confidentiality of reference and
     background screening results. The State reserves the right to reject the Vendor’s Project
     Staff as a result of such reference and background checks. The State also reserves the
     right to require removal or reassignment of the Vendor’s key Project Staff found
     unacceptable to the State.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the State shall have the option to terminate
     the Contract, at its discretion, if it is dissatisfied with the Vendor’s replacement Project
     Staff.

H-25.6 Work Plan
     Vendor shall submit a preliminary Work Plan in its Proposal. The Work Plan shall include,
     without limitation, a detailed description of the Schedule, tasks, Deliverables, major
     milestones, task dependencies, and payment schedule. A final Work Plan will be due
     five (5) business days after Contract award upon approval by Governor and Executive
     Council.

     The Vendor shall update the Work Plan as necessary, but no less than every two weeks
     to accurately reflect the status of the Project, including without limitation, the Schedule,
     tasks, Deliverables, major milestones, task dependencies, and payment schedule. Any
     updates to the Work Plan shall require the written approval of the State prior to final
     incorporation into the Contract.

     Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the State, changes to the Work Plan shall not
     relieve the Vendor from liability to the State for any damages resulting from the Vendor’s
     failure to perform its obligations under the Contract, including without limitation,
     performance in accordance with the Schedule.

     In the event of a delay in the Schedule, the Vendor must immediately notify the State in
     writing. The written notification will identify the nature of the delay, i.e., specific actions
     or inactions of the Vendor or State causing the problem; its estimated duration period
     to reconciliation; specific actions that need to be taken to correct the problem; and
     the expected Schedule affect the Project.

      In the event the Vendor requires additional time to correct Deficiencies, the Schedule
      shall not change unless previously agreed in writing by the State, except that the
      Schedule shall automatically extend on a day-to-day basis to the extent that the delay
      does not result from Vendor’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the Contract. To the
      extent that the State’s execution of its major tasks takes longer than described in the
      Work Plan, the Schedule shall automatically extend on a day-to-day basis.

      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the State shall have the option to terminate
      the Contract for default, at its discretion, if it is dissatisfied with the Vendor’s Work Plan or
      elements within the Work Plan.

H-25.7 Change Orders
      The State may make changes or revisions at any time by written Change Order. Within
      five (5) business days of a Vendor’s receipt of a Change Order, the Vendor shall advise
      the State, in detail, of any impact on cost (e.g., increase or decrease), the Schedule, or
      the Work Plan.

      A Vendor may request a change within the scope of the Contract by written Change
      Order, identifying any impact on cost, the Schedule, or the Work Plan. The State shall
      attempt to respond to a Vendor’s requested Change Order within five (5) business days.
      The State, which includes the requesting Agency and the Department of Information
      Technology, must approve all change orders in writing. The State shall be deemed to
      have rejected the Change Order if the parties are unable to reach an agreement in
      writing.

      All Change Order requests from a Vendor to the State, and the State acceptance of a
      Vendor’s estimate for a State requested change, will be acknowledged and responded
      to, either acceptance or rejection, in writing. If accepted, the Change Order(s) shall be
      subject to the Contract amendment process, as determined to apply by the State.

H-25.8 Deliverables
      The Vendor shall provide the State with the Deliverables and Services in accordance
      with the time frames in the Work Plan. All Deliverables shall be subject to the State’s
      Acceptance as set forth in Section H-25.9: Testing and Acceptance herein. Upon its
      submission of a Deliverable, the Vendor represents that it has performed its obligations
      under the Contract associated with the Deliverable.

      By unconditionally accepting a Deliverable, the State reserves the right to reject any
      and all Deliverables in the event the State detects any Deficiency in the System, in whole
      or in part, through completion of all Acceptance Testing, including but not limited to,
      Software/System Acceptance Testing, and any extensions thereof.

      For each denial of Acceptance, the Acceptance Period may be extended, at the
      option of the State, by the corresponding time required to correct the Deficiency, retest
      or Review.

As part of the Software maintenance agreement, ongoing software
maintenance and support levels, including all new Software releases, shall be
responded to according to the following:

 a. Severity Level 1 is defined as urgent situations, when any part, portion, or
 module of the system is down and New Hampshire is unable to use the system.
 Upon notification of a severity level 1 problem, the Vendor will make every
 attempt to respond as soon as possible with the expectation that the response
 be within five (5) minutes. The Vendor will resolve Severity Level 1 problems
 within four (4) hours.
 b. Severity Level 2 is defined as a critical software system component(s) that
 has significant outages and/or failure precluding its successful operation. The
 system may be operational but is severely restricted (for example, credentials
 cannot be opened). Upon notification of a severity level 2 problem, the
 Vendor will make every attempt to respond as soon as possible with the
 expectation that the response be within 30 minutes. The Vendor will resolve
 Severity Level 2 problems within six (6) hours.
 c. Severity Level 3 is defined as a minor problem that exists with the system but
 the majority of the functions are still usable and some circumvention may be
 required to provide service. The Vendor will resolve Severity Level 3 problems
 as quickly as possible, which on average should not exceed thirty business
 days.
 d. Severity Level 4 is defined as a very minor problem or question that does not
 affect system function (for example, the text of a message is worded poorly or
 misspelled). The Vendor will work with New Hampshire to determine the
 appropriate turn-around time for Severity Level 4 problems.
 e. Unusual Circumstances: Any issue/problem that may possibly endanger
 New Hampshire technical environment will receive immediate remedial

         upon price, if separately stated, for Deliverables or Services for which Acceptance
         has been given by the State prior to such termination. Amounts for Services or
         Deliverables provided prior to the date of termination for which no separate price
         is stated will be paid, in whole or in part, generally in accordance with Appendix
         F: Pricing Worksheets.

          During the thirty (30) day period, the Vendor shall wind down and cease its
         Services as quickly and efficiently as reasonably possible, without performing
         unnecessary Services or activities and by minimizing negative effects on the State
         from such winding down and cessation of Services.

H-25.15.3 Termination for Conflict of Interest
     The State may terminate the Contract by written notice if it determines that a
    conflict of interest exists, including but not limited to, a violation by any of the
    parties hereto of applicable laws regarding ethics in public acquisitions and
    procurement and performance of Contracts.

      In such case, the State shall be entitled to a pro-rated refund of any current
    development, support and maintenance costs. The State shall pay all other
    contracted payments that would have become due and payable if the Vendor
    did not know, or reasonably did not know, of the conflict of interest.

    In the event the Contract is terminated as provided above pursuant to a violation
    by the Vendor, the State shall be entitled to pursue the same remedies against the
    Vendor as it could pursue in the event of a default of the Contract by the Vendor.

H-25.15.4 Termination Procedure

     Upon termination of the Contract, the State, in addition to any other rights
     provided in the Contract, may require the Vendor to deliver to the State any
     property, including without limitation, Software and Written Deliverables, for such
     part of the Contract as has been terminated.

     After receipt of a notice of termination, and except as otherwise directed by the
     State, Vendor shall:

      a. Stop work under the Contract on the date, and to the extent specified, in
      the notice;

      b. Promptly, but in no event longer than thirty (30) days after termination,
         terminate its orders and subcontracts related to the work which has been
         terminated and settle all outstanding liabilities and all claims arising out of
         such termination of orders and subcontracts, with the approval or ratification
         of the State to the extent required, which approval or ratification shall be
         final for the purpose of this Section;

      c. Take such action as the State directs, or as necessary to preserve and protect
         the property related to the Contract which is in the possession of Vendor and
         in which State has an interest;

      d. Transfer title to the State and deliver in the manner, at the times, and to the
         extent directed by the State, any property which is required to be furnished
         to State and which has been accepted or requested by the State; and

      e. Provide written certification to the State that Vendor has surrendered to the
         State all said property.

H-25.16 Limitation of Liability

      H-25.16.1 State
           Subject to applicable laws and regulations, in no event shall the State be liable
           for any consequential, special, indirect, incidental, punitive, or exemplary
           damages. Subject to applicable laws and regulations, the State’s liability to the
           Vendor shall not exceed the total Contract price set forth in Contract Agreement,
           Appendix H Section 1.8 of the Contract Agreement – General Provisions.

           Notwithstanding the foregoing and any provision of this Contract to the contrary,
           in no event does the State waive its sovereign immunity or any applicable
           defenses or immunities.

      H-25.16.2 State’s Immunity
           Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein contained shall be deemed to
           constitute a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the State, which immunity is
           hereby reserved to the State. This covenant shall survive termination or Contract
           conclusion.

      H.25.16.3 Survival

             Contract termination or conclusion.

H-25.17 Change of Ownership
        In the event that the Vendor should change ownership for any reason whatsoever,
        the State shall have the option of continuing under the Contract with the Vendor, its
        successors or assigns for the full remaining term of the Contract; continuing under the
        Contract with the Vendor, its successors or assigns for such period of time as
        determined necessary by the State; or immediately terminate the Contract without

H-25.18 Assignment, Delegation and Subcontracts
        The Vendor shall not assign, delegate, subcontract, or otherwise transfer any of its
        interest, rights, or duties under the Contract without the prior written consent of the
        State. Such consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Any attempted transfer,
        assignment, delegation, or other transfer made without the State’s prior written
        consent shall be null and void and may constitute an event of default at the sole
        discretion of the State.

        The Vendor shall remain wholly responsible for performance of the entire Contract
        regardless of whether assignees, delegates, Subcontractors or other transferees
        (“Assigns”) are used, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the State and the Assigns
        fully assumes in writing any and all obligations and liabilities under the Contract from
        the Effective Date. In the absence of a written assumption of full obligations and
        liabilities of the Contract, any permitted assignment, delegation, subcontract or other

       nor shall it affect any remedies available to the State against the Vendor that may
       arise from any event of default of the provisions of the Contract. The State will
       consider the Vendor to be the sole point of contact with regard to all contractual
       matters, including payment of any and all charges resulting from the Contract.

H-25.19 Dispute Resolution
      Prior to the filing of any formal proceedings with respect to a dispute (other than an
      action seeking injunctive relief with respect to intellectual property rights or Confidential
      Information), the party believing itself aggrieved (the "Invoking Party") shall call for
