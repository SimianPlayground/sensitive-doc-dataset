                                       STATEMENTS REQUIRED BY LAWS AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS

To comply with legislation passed by the Congress and Executive Orders issued by the President, Federal executive agencies,
including the Small Business Administration (SBA), must notify you of certain information. You can find the regulations and
policies implementing these laws and Executive Orders in Title 13, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter 1, or our
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). In order to provide the required notices, the following is a brief summary of the various
laws and Executive Orders that affect SBA's Disaster Loan Programs.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (5 U.S.C. § 552)

This law provides, with some exceptions, that we must make records or portions of records contained in our files available to
persons requesting them. This generally includes aggregate statistical information on our disaster loan programs and other
information such as names of borrowers (and their officers, directors, stockholders or partners), loan amounts at maturity, the
collateral pledged, and the general purpose of loans. We do not routinely make available to third parties your proprietary data
without first doing pre-notification, required by Executive Order 12600, or information that would cause competitive harm or
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

Send a request under this Act to the SBA office maintaining the records requested and identify it as a Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA) request. The request must describe the specific records you want. For information about the FOIA, contact the
Chief, FOI/PA Office, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 5900, Washington, DC 20416, or by e-mail at foia@sba.gov.

PRIVACY ACT (5 U.S.C. § 552a)

Anyone can request to see or get copies of any personal information that we have in your file. Any personal information in your
file that is retrieved by individual identifiers, such as name or social security number is protected by the Privacy Act, which means
requests for information about you may be denied unless we have your written permission to release the information to the requestor
or unless the information is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The Agreements and Certifications section of
this form contains written permission for us to disclose the information resulting from this collection to state, local or private disaster
relief services.

The Privacy Act authorizes SBA to make certain "routine uses" of information protected by that Act. One such routine use for SBA's
loan system of records is that when this information indicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil, criminal,
or administrative in nature, SBA may refer it to the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local or foreign, charged with
responsibility for or otherwise involved in investigation, prosecution, enforcement or prevention of such violations. Another routine
use of personal information is to assist in obtaining credit bureau reports, on the Disaster Loan Applicants and guarantors for purposes
of originating, servicing, and liquidating Disaster loans. See, 69 F.R. 58598, 58617 (and as amended from time to time) for additional
background and other routine uses.

 Under the provisions of the Privacy Act, you are not required to provide social security numbers. (But see the information under
 Debt Collection Act below) We use social security numbers to distinguish between people with a similar or the same name for
 credit decisions and for debt collection purposes. Failure to provide this number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to
 which you are entitled by law, but having the number makes it easier for us to more accurately identify to whom adverse credit
 information applies and to keep accurate loan records.

 Note: Any person concerned with the collection, use and disclosure of information, under the Privacy Act may contact the Chief, FOI/
 PA Office, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 5900, Washington, DC 20416 or by e-mail at foia@sba.gov for information about the Agency's
 procedures relating to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act.


DEBT COLLECTION ACT OF 1982; DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT OF 1984; DEBT COLLECTION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF
1996 & other titles (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.)
These laws require us to aggressively collect any delinquent loan payments and to require you to give your taxpayer identification number
to us when you apply for a loan. If you receive a loan and do not make payments when they become due, we may take one or more of the
following actions (this list may not be exhaustive):

           *Report the delinquency to credit reporting bureaus.
           *Offset your income tax refunds or other amounts due to you from the Federal Government.
           *Refer the account to a private collection agency or other agency operating a debt collection center.
           *Suspend or debar you from doing business with the Federal Government.
           *Refer your loan to the Department of Justice.
           *Foreclose on collateral or take other actions permitted in the loan instruments.
           *Garnish wages.
           *Sell the debt.
           *Litigate or foreclose.
 RIGHT TO FINANCIAL PRIVACY ACT OF 1978 (12 U.S.C. § 3401 et seq.)

This notifies you, as required by the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (Act), of our right to access financial records held by financial
institutions that were or are doing business with you or your business. This includes financial institutions participating in loans or loan
 guarantees.

The law provides that we may access your financial records when considering or administering Government loan or loan guaranty assistance
to you. We must give a financial institution a certificate of our compliance with the Act when we first request access to your financial records.
No other certification is required for later access. Our access rights continue for the term of any approved loan or loan guaranty. We do not
have to give you any additional notice of our access rights during the term of the loan or loan guaranty.

We may transfer to another Government authority any financial records included in a loan application or about an approved loan or loan
guaranty as necessary to process, service, liquidate, or foreclose a loan or loan guaranty. We will not permit any transfer of your financial
records to another Government authority except as required or permitted by law.

Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35)

We are collecting the information on this form in order to make disaster loans available to qualified small businesses. The form is
designed to collect the information necessary for us to make eligibility and credit decisions in order to fund or deny loan requests.
We will also use the information collected on this form to produce summary reports for program and management analysis, as
required by law.

PLEASE NOTE: The estimated burden for completing this form is 2 hours. Your responses to the requested information are required
in order to obtain a benefit under SBA's Disaster Business Loan Programs. However, you are not required to respond to any
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB approval number. If you have any questions or comments concerning
any aspects of this information collection, please contact the U.S. Small Business Administration Information Branch, 409 3rd St., SW,
Washington, DC 20416 and Desk Officer for SBA, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
725 17th St., NW, Washington, DC 20503. (3245-0017) PLEASE DO NOT SEND FORMS TO OMB.

Policy Concerning Representatives and Their Fees

When you apply for an SBA loan, you may use an attorney, accountant, engineer, appraiser or other representative to help
prepare and present the application to us. You are not required to have representation. If an application is approved, you may
need an attorney to help prepare closing documents.

There are no "authorized representatives" of SBA, other than our regular salaried employees. Payment of a fee or gratuity to our
employees is illegal and will subject those involved to prosecution.

SBA Regulations prohibit representatives from proposing or charging any fee for services performed in connection with your
loan unless we consider the services necessary and the amount reasonable. The Regulations also prohibit charging you any
commitment, bonus, broker, commission, referral or similar fee. We will not approve the payment of any bonus, brokerage fee or
commission. Also, we will not approve placement or finder's fees for using or trying to use influence in the SBA loan
application process.

Fees to representatives must be reasonable for services provided in connection with the application or the closing and based upon
the time and effort required, the qualifications of the representative, and the nature and extent of work performed.
Representatives must execute a compensation agreement.

In the appropriate section of the application, you must state the names of everyone employed by you or on your behalf. You
must also notify the SBA disaster office in writing of the names and fees of any representative you employ after you file your
application.

If you have any questions concerning payment of fees or reasonableness of fees, contact the Field Office where you filed or will
file your application.

Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 3651 et seq.)

This legislation authorizes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the Department of Labor to require
businesses to modify facilities and procedures to protect employees when appropriate. If your business does not do so, you may
be penalized, forced to close or prevented from starting operations in a new facility. Because of this, we may require information
from you to determine whether your business complies with OSHA regulations and may continue operating after the loan is
approved or disbursed. You must certify to us that OSHA requirements applying to your business have been determined and that
you are, to the best of your knowledge, in compliance.
