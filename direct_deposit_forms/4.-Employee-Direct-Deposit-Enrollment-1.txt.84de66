          Employee Direct Deposit Enrollment Form
Please fill out this form and return to the Treasurer's Office. Attach a voided check for each checking account – not a
deposit slip. If depositing into a savings account, ask your bank to give you the routing/transit number for your account. It
isn’t always the same number on a savings deposit slip. This will help ensure that you are paid correctly.



IMPORTANT! Please read and sign before completing and submitting.
I authorize Portage Lakes Career Center to initiate electronic credit entries, and if necessary, debit entries and
adjustments for any credit entries in error to my account listed below.
