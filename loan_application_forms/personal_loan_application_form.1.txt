     By ticking this box you consent to ME disclosing your name, residential address and date of birth to a credit reporting agency to assist us

     preparing the assessment the credit reporting agency may use the personal information about you and other individuals contained in their
     credit information files. No other information about your credit information file will be provided to ME. If you don’t want your identity verified
     using your credit information file we will try to verify your identity from other electronic data sources.
