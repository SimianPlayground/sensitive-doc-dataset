At WEST VALLEY NATIONAL BANK, customer service is very important to us. As we continue to improve and expand our services and delivery channels, we
recognize that our customers need and desire to preserve their privacy and confidentiality.
Safeguarding our customers’ privacy is also very important to us. We, at WEST VALLEY NATIONAL BANK, have adopted standards that hold our employees
responsible for maintaining and preserving customer confidentiality.
The following Statement affirms our continued commitment to preserving customer confidentiality.
Information we collect

We gather nonpublic personal information about our customers, including information gathered over the Internet, for specific business purposes only.

We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:

          Information we receive from you on applications or other forms;
          Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; and
          Information we receive from a consumer-reporting agency.

We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as permitted by law.


Information we disclose, as permitted by law

Some examples of instances when we may disclose nonpublic personal information about our customers or former customers include:

          To provide you with products and services you may want;
          To complete or verify a transaction;
          To manage customer accounts, transactions and records;
          To investigate possible fraud or criminal activity;
          To comply with laws or regulations; and
