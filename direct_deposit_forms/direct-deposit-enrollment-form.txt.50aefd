                                 EMPLOYEE DIRECT DEPOSIT ENROLLMENT FORM


   AGENCY NAME ________________________                                     EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER _________________


To enroll in Full Service Direct Deposit, simply fill out this form and give it to your Human Resource Generalist. Attach a voided
check for each checking account – not a deposit slip. If depositing into a savings account, ask your bank to give you the
Routing/Transit Number for your account. It isn’t always the same as the number on the savings deposit slip. This will help ensure
that you are paid correctly.
Below is a sample check MICR line detailing where the information necessary to complete this form can be found.




_____________________________________________________________________
IMPORTANT! Please read and sign before completing and submitting.
I hereby authorize CCS, either directly or through its payroll service provider, to deposit any amounts owed to me by initiating credit
entries to my account at the financial institution(s) indicated on this form. Further, I authorize the financial institution(s) to accept and
to credit any credit entries indicated by CCS, either directly or through its payroll service provider, to my account(s). In the event that
CCS deposits funds erroneously into my account, I authorize CCS, either directly or through its payroll service provider, to debit my
account for an amount not to exceed the original amount of the erroneous credit.
            This authorization is to remain in full force and effect until CCS and the financial institution(s) have received written notice
from me of its termination in such time and in such manners as to afford CCS and the financial institution(s) reasonable opportunity
to act on it.
