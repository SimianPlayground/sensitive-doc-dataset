                                                   Direct Deposit Form


The most convenient way to manage your everyday
financial transactions!
Direct deposit is a free service that automatically deposits your paycheck, or any reoccurring income,
into your South State checking or savings account.

Instead of making time to go to the bank to deposit your paycheck, your funds will be available
automatically, making it faster and thereâ€™s no worries of losing your check. Same-day access to your
money means not waiting for your deposit to clear into your account.
