                   our Notice before signing this Consent. The terms of our Notice may change. If a change is
                   made, you may obtain a revised copy of the Notice by visiting our website or by directly
                   contacting our office.

                   You have the right to request that we restrict how your PHI is used or disclosed for treatment,
                   payment, or healthcare operations.

                   By signing this form, you consent to our use and disclosure of your PHI for treatment,
                   payment, and healthcare operations. You have the right to revoke this Consent by submitting
                   a signed, written request. However, such revocation shall not affect any discolsures we have
                   already made in reliance on your prior Consent. Matthew Anderson, DMD, MSD, Inc. provides
                   this form to you in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
                   1996 (HIPAA).

                   The Patient understands that:
                                  Protected health information may be disclosed or used for treatment,
                                  payment, or health care operations
                                  The Practice had a Notice of Privacy Practices and that the Patient has the
                                  opportunity to review this Notice
                                  The Practice reserves the right to change the Notice of Privacy Policies
                                  The Patient has the right to restrict the uses of their information
                                  The Patient may revoke this Consent in writing at any time and all future

                                  The Practice may condition treatment upon execution of this Consent. No
