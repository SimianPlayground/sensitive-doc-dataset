                                          CHAPTER 1 -
                                           OVERVIEW


Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) maintains student records in compliance with laws of
both the Commonwealth of Virginia and the federal government. Primary guidance for the
handling of scholastic records is from the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA),
the federal law designed to protect the privacy of a student’s scholastic records. All public
schools, including FCPS, are covered by FERPA.

FERPA protects the rights of parents with respect to their children’s scholastic records. These
rights transfer to the student, or former student, upon reaching the age of 18 or entering a
postsecondary school (not dual enrollment). Students and former students to whom the rights
have transferred are called “eligible students.”

FCPS provides notice to parents and eligible students of their rights under FERPA at the
beginning of each school year through the Annual Notice of Survey, Records, Curriculum,
Privacy, and Related Rights, and Opt-Out Forms and Explanations (the FCPS Opt-Out Forms
Packet). The current version of the FCPS Opt-Out Forms Packet is available in English and
translated versions on the FCPS public website at FCPS Registration Opt-Out Forms.

Parents or eligible students who wish to file a complaint alleging that FCPS is not in compliance
with FERPA should first inform the school principal of the complaint and work with the school to
resolve the matter. If not satisfied with the results they may appeal to the FCPS Region Office.
A parent or eligible student may also file a written complaint regarding an alleged violation with
the Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO). The FPCO address is: Family Policy Compliance
Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20202-
5920. A complaint must contain the specific allegations of fact giving reasonable cause to
believe that a violation of FERPA occurred.

                                          DEFINITIONS


The following definitions apply in these guidelines:

Access – the ability to inspect, review records, and/or have copies of records.

Attendance – includes, but is not limited to, attendance in person, online courses, and the
period during which a person is working under a work-study program.

Business day – a day on which FCPS central offices are open. An alternate term is working
day.

Centrally maintained student files – student files maintained by the school or central office for
a student. This includes the student’s cumulative file, school health room file, disciplinary file,
special education file, special services file, advanced academics file, attendance record,
hearings office file, attendance records, and due process file.

Dates of attendance – the period of time during which a student attends or attended an FCPS
school. Examples of dates of attendance include an academic year, a spring semester, or a
first quarter. The term does not include specific daily records of a student’s attendance.

Directory information – information contained in an education record of a student that would
not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. The FCPS definition
of “directory information” is set forth at the beginning of each school year in the Annual Notice of
Survey, Records, Curriculum, Privacy, and Related Rights and Opt-Out Forms (the Opt-Out
Forms packet). Changes to the definition of “directory information” may occur annually and are
published in the Opt-Out Forms packet. Any disclosure of directory information must be made
in accordance with the current school year’s definition of directory information. The current
version may be found on the FCPS public website at: https://www.fcps.edu/registration/opt-out-
forms.

Disciplinary action or proceeding – the investigation, adjudication, and/or imposition of
sanctions by FCPS with respect to an infraction or violation of Student Rights and
Responsibilities.

identifiable information contained in scholastic records to any party, by any means, including
oral, written, and electronic means.

FCPS or by a party acting for FCPS. An alternate term is scholastic record.

Eligible student – a student enrolled in FCPS who has reached 18 years of age or has entered
a postsecondary institution regardless of age. Concurrent enrollment in FCPS and a
postsecondary institution does not make a student “eligible.”

                            THE STUDENT SCHOLASTIC RECORD


STUDENT SCHOLASTIC RECORDS

Student scholastic records are those records that are directly related to a student and are
maintained by FCPS or by a party acting for FCPS.

The content of the scholastic record should be limited to data needed by the school to assist the
student in his or her personal, social, educational, and career development, otherwise provide
services, or comply with state or federal requirements. Scholastic records (which may be
collected orally, in writing, or by electronic means including e-mail) encompass all records
maintained by FCPS that contain information about a student, except those records specifically
exempted by law. See Section 10 of this chapter. It is important to note that a document can be
considered “personally identifiable information” without identification of the student by name. A
personal identifier includes any personal characteristics that would make the student’s identity
easily traceable; for example, a student ID number, his or her initials, or other means.

1.   Record Format
     Scholastic records are not limited to paper records. A scholastic record is any information
     recorded in any way, including but not limited to, handwriting, print, computer media,
     videotape, audiotape, film, microfilm, and microfiche. The term “computer media” is
     intended to cover any manner of maintaining information that is stored digitally. If e-mail
     directly relates to the student and is maintained by FCPS or by a party acting for FCPS, it is
     part of the student’s education record.

2.   Types of Records
     The scholastic record encompasses all of the various records about a student created or
     collected by FCPS and maintained in FCPS files. The contents of the scholastic record will
     differ from student to student, depending on which records exist for that student. Chapter 8
     provides a list of the various types of files that may exist for a student.

3.   Records Collected for All Students
     Certain data must be collected and maintained for all students. The following data must be
     maintained, when applicable:

           •   Academic transcript
           •   Legal name and address of student
           •   Birth date
           •   Sex
           •   Student ID
           •   Name and address of parent
           •   Record of attendance
           •   Schools attended
           •   Grades and grade point average
           •   Type of diploma earned
           •   Test and assessment data
           •   School entrance physical examination report, immunization certificate, or verification
               of immunizations
           •   Adjudication Affirmation information (SS/SE-219) (must be maintained separate from

                                                                 Student Scholastic Records Manual

               other records)
           •   Record of Disclosure of Student Record (SS/SE-94)
           •   Student termination information (graduation/withdrawal/program completion)

4.   Student Identification
     The child’s legal name, birth date, sex, and parent(s) name as they appear on the birth
     certificate shall be considered the student’s official identification and shall be entered in the
     FCPS student scholastic record and in FCPS systems. A court order, updated birth
     certificate, or passport attesting to any changes in student identification is required before
     any changes will be made to the student scholastic record. Changes in a foreign birth
     certificate must be supported by a document issued by the United States government or by
     an official identification document of the country of origin. When a change does occur, a
     copy of the document supporting the change is maintained in the scholastic record. Once a
     student is no longer enrolled in FCPS, no changes to student identification will be made
     other than to correct an error. See the current version of Regulation 2202.

5.   School Adjudication Affirmation
     At enrollment, the parent must provide a sworn statement or affirmation indicating whether
     the student has been expelled from school attendance at a private or public school for an
     offense in violation of school board policies relating to weapons, alcohol or drugs, or for the
     willful infliction of injury to another person. The FCPS Student Registration form provides a
     place for the enrolling parent to attest to their student’s status. A completed, signed
     registration form is required each time a student is enrolled in an FCPS school. See the
     current version of Regulation 2202 and SS/SE-219

6.   Social Security Number
     A social security number (SSN) is not required to be included within the student scholastic
     record. FCPS does not require that such information be included in a student’s
     computerized records. Any SSN information that exists for a particular student may be
     maintained in that student’s cumulative file. Student files and other records shall be
     maintained and tracked by means of an FCPS-assigned student identification number, not
     the student’s SSN.

7.   Birth Certificates and Enrollment
     When enrolling a student in FCPS, the parent or student must provide an original certified
     birth certificate. The information on this certificate is used to establish the complete legal
     name of the student, the student’s date of birth, sex, and the names of the parents. Data
     entered on FCPS forms and data entered into FCPS systems must match the information
     provided on the certificate. In the absence of a birth certificate, an affidavit must be
     submitted with the required information and an explanation of why the birth certificate
     cannot be provided. The affidavit should be accompanied by another bona fide record that
     supports the information supplied in the affidavit see Regulation 2202. FCPS regards
     retention of copies of the birth certificate in the active cumulative file as best practice. Refer
     to Section 4 of this chapter for more information about both documents.

     If the above requirement cannot be met, the principal shall enroll the child temporarily for
     30 days to allow the parent time to present the required birth certificate or documented
     affidavit.

8.   Visa
     A visa is not part of the student scholastic record and is not retained. FCPS accepts
     students who meet the requirements of Regulation 2202.

9.   Homeless Students
     A student is considered to be homeless when he or she lacks a fixed, regular, and
     adequate nighttime residence. FCPS must immediately enroll homeless students even if
     they do not have the required documents, such as a birth certificate, school records,
     medical records, proof of residency, or other documents. The enrolling school shall
     immediately contact the last school the homeless student attended to obtain relevant
     academic and other records. The student must be enrolled while the records are being
     obtained. The term “enroll” is defined as attending classes and participating fully in school
     activities. The FCPS Homeless Liaison is available to provide assistance in determining
     whether a student is in a homeless situation. See Regulation 2205.

10. Records not required to be disclosed under FERPA
    Certain records are not considered scholastic records and will not be disclosed in response
    to a request from the parent or eligible student (see Chapter 5, Section XII for subpoena
    information). These include:

          •   Records that are kept in the sole possession of the maker and are used only as a
              personal memory aid, and are not accessible or revealed to any other person
              except a temporary substitute for the maker of the record (this is a FERPA
              exception and does not necessarily exempt these records from disclosure
              pursuant to a subpoena, search warrant, discovery request, or court order).
          •   Records that are created and maintained for a law enforcement purpose by the
              Office of Safety and Security, safety and security specialists, safety and security
              assistants, school resource officers, human resource investigators, and
              administrators specifically designated by a principal or program manager as
              designated members of the FCPS law enforcement unit.
          •   Records relating to an individual who is employed by FCPS that are made and
              maintained in the normal course of business; relate exclusively to the individual in
              that individual’s capacity as an employee; and are not available for use for any
              other purpose.
          •   Records that only contain information about an individual after he or she is no
              longer a student at FCPS, for example, alumni records.
          •   Records that are protected by the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work-
              product privilege:

                 The attorney-client privilege protects from disclosure any communications to,
                  from, or with an attorney in which the client is seeking legal advice or the attorney
                  is providing it.
                 The attorney work-product privilege protects from disclosure any writing that
                  reflects an attorney's impressions, conclusions, opinions, legal research, or
                  theories.
                 This means that any FCPS records (including student scholastic records) that
                  reflect communications between FCPS and its attorneys (Division Counsel and/or
                  law firms, or other legal counsel employed by FCPS) or work-product of those
                  attorneys shall not be disclosed to anyone who is not an FCPS school official, with
                  a need to know. Volunteers are not considered school officials for this purpose.
                 This exemption applies only to records containing communications between FCPS
                  and its attorneys or work-product of FCPS attorneys. It does not apply to
                  communications between FCPS attorneys and others or communications from
                  attorneys representing parents, community members, or other third parties.

                          PARENT AND ELIGIBLE STUDENT RIGHTS


I.   SCHOLASTIC RECORDS RIGHTS

Parents and eligible students (see Section V below) have the following rights regarding
inspection and review of the student’s scholastic records:

     A. To inspect and review the scholastic records of the student. When a student’s scholastic
        record contains personally identifiable information on other students, a parent or eligible
        student’s right to inspect and review or be informed pertains only to that part of the
        record or document that relates to the specific student.

     B. To inspect or review scholastic records of a student with a disability without unnecessary
        delay and before any meeting regarding an Individualized Education Program (IEP), or
        any hearing as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The
        IDEA also allows the parent to have a representative inspect and review the records.

     C. To (1) request that FCPS correct or delete data that the parent or eligible student
        believes to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy
        rights, (2) request a hearing to challenge an FCPS decision denying such a request to
        amend the student’s record, and (3) insert a written explanation into the student
        scholastic record stating the reason for objecting to the content of the record. See
        Chapter 7 for specific procedures.

     D. To receive an annual public notice of parent rights and designated categories of
        directory information and the opportunity to opt out of the release of directory
        information. See Section II of this chapter.

     E. To receive copies of scholastic records if circumstances effectively prevent the parent or
        eligible student from exercising the right to inspect and review the student’s scholastic
        records (for example, a parent who lives outside of Fairfax County who is unable to
        review the records in person). In addition, parents are entitled to receive copies, upon
        request, of records that are disclosed to another school that their child is attending or
        plans to attend.

     F. To receive a response to reasonable requests for explanations and interpretations of the
        scholastic records.

II. ACCESS RIGHTS NOTIFICATION

FCPS provides notice to parents and eligible students of their rights under FERPA at the
beginning of each school year through the Annual Notice of Survey, Records, Curriculum,
Privacy, and Related Rights and Opt-Out Forms and Explanations (the FCPS opt-out forms
packet). The FCPS opt-out forms packet is available in English and translated versions on the
FCPS public website at FCPS Registration Opt-Out Forms.

It is the responsibility of the enrolling parent to complete Opt Out forms. See Regulation 2240.

III. ACCESS FEES

FCPS may charge for providing copies of scholastic records in accordance with Notice 2701,
Schedule of Fees for Duplicating Student Scholastic Records. If the fees charged would
prevent a parent or eligible student from exercising his or her right to inspect and review the
scholastic records, the fees will be waived. The fees do not include the cost to search for and
retrieve the scholastic records of a student.

   Note: No student’s scholastic record, report card, or diploma shall be withheld because of
   nonpayment of any fee or charge.

IV. LIMITING PARENT ACCESS RIGHTS

FCPS gives full rights to either parent, unless FCPS has been provided with a copy of a court
order that specifically prohibits access to scholastic records. Parental access rights are also
restricted when the student becomes an eligible student, see Section B below.

   A. Objections between Parents
      Only a court order or legally binding document may restrict either parent’s exercise of
      their rights under FERPA (e.g., to access student records, consent for others to have
      access, request an amendment to the records). If a parent believes that the other parent
      should not be allowed to exercise these rights, the parent must obtain a valid court order
      that specifically addresses and limits the other parent’s rights. (A visitation schedule or a
      custody order, unless it specifically addresses and limits a parent’s right to the student’s
      records, does not restrict a parent’s FERPA rights.) If a parent has not provided FCPS
      with a copy of such a court order or other legally binding document, FCPS has no basis
      to deny the other parent’s request to exercise his or her rights under FERPA.

   B. Parents of Eligible Students
      FCPS shall presume that all students currently enrolled in FCPS remain the tax
      dependent of their parents. If an eligible student enrolled in FCPS asserts that he or she
      is no longer a dependent and does not wish his or her records to be disclosed to the
      parent, FCPS may notify the parent and offer the parent the opportunity to demonstrate
      that the student remains a dependent. The parent may do so by providing a copy of the
      relevant portion of the parent’s or parents’ most recent tax return(s) showing that the
      student was claimed as a dependent. The parent or parents may redact all financial and
      other unnecessary information that appears on the form, as long as the tax return clearly
      shows the parent’s or parents’ names and the fact that the student is claimed as a
      dependent. (See Section V below). However, FCPS may disclose scholastic records to
      the parents of a currently enrolled eligible student if the eligible student is considered a
      dependent for income tax purposes. The term “dependent” is defined in Section 152 of
      the Internal Revenue Code. In this case, the parent cannot provide authorization for a
      third party to be granted access to the student’s scholastic record nor may they request
      amendment to the records.

       A parent of a student with a disability who is aged 18 or older may retain his or her
       parental rights provided that a court has determined the student to be legally
       incompetent or legally incapacitated and has granted guardianship to the parent. It the
       responsibility of the parent or other individual named as guardian to provide FCPS with a
       court order or other legally binding document establishing his or her rights.

                                                                   Fairfax County Public Schools
                                                              Student Scholastic Records Manual

       If the eligible student is no longer enrolled in FCPS, FCPS shall require either (1) the
       eligible students’ written consent, (2) a showing by the parent as described above that
       the student remains a dependent for tax purposes, or (3) the parents maintains
       guardianship.

V. ELIGIBLE STUDENTS

“Eligible student” means a student who has reached 18 years of age or is attending an
institution of postsecondary education. Upon becoming an eligible student, the student has full
rights to their own scholastic record, and the parents’ right to access is limited. A parent retains
the right of access as long as the eligible student is considered a dependent for income tax
purposes unless the principal or designee determines that (1) doing so would pose a safety
concern for the student; (2) is prohibited by court order; or (3) for other good cause. An eligible
student’s request that FCPS deny the parent access to the student’s records will not be honored
unless the exceptions described in this section are found to apply.

Students over 18 years of age, identified as eligible students, who are self-enrolling and are
identified as unaccompanied and homeless youth do not require parental notification or a
determination of dependency status. Any questions regarding a student in this situation should
be directed to the Homeless Liaison at 571-423-4332.

                                 CHAPTER 5 -
         DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION FROM STUDENT SCHOLASTIC RECORDS


I.   DISCLOSURE CONSIDERATIONS

FCPS is responsible for protecting the confidentiality of scholastic records. Before personally
identifiable information is disclosed from a student’s scholastic record to any person other than
a parent or eligible student, FCPS must receive a signed and dated consent from either the
parent or eligible student (see Section IV of this chapter) or determine that the request comes
from a source that is permitted access without consent (see Section II of this chapter).

II. ACCESS WITHOUT CONSENT

FCPS has authority to disclose scholastic records without the consent of the parents or eligible
student to the following parties if they meet the described conditions:

     A. School officials within FCPS who have a legitimate educational interest in the records.

     B. Officials of another school, school division, or institution of postsecondary education in
        which the student intends to enroll. FCPS requires a written release from the parent or
        eligible student before sending records to postsecondary institutions.

     C. Authorized representatives of the Comptroller General of the United States, the Attorney
        General of the United States, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state or local
        educational authorities. Virginia law prohibits FCPS from disclosing student records to
        the federal government unless the disclosure is required by law.

     D. State and local officials or authorities to whom the information is allowed to be reported
        or disclosed pursuant to a state statute adopted before November 19, 1974, if the
        allowed reporting or disclosure concerns the juvenile justice system and the system’s
        ability to effectively serve the student whose records are released; or after November 19,
        1974, if the allowed reporting or disclosure concerns the juvenile justice system and
        such system’s ability to effectively serve, prior to adjudication, the student whose records
        are released; and the officials and authorities to whom such information is disclosed
        certify in writing to the educational institution that the information will not be disclosed to
        any other party except as provided under state law without the prior consent of the
        parent of the student. See Chapter 9, FAQ #39.

     E. A party when the disclosure is in connection with financial aid for which the student has
        applied or which the student has received, if the information is necessary to determine
        eligibility for the aid, the amount of the aid, the conditions of the aid, or enforce the terms
        and conditions of the aid. “Financial aid” means payment of funds to an individual, or a
        payment in-kind of tangible or intangible property to an individual, that is conditioned on
        the individual’s attendance at an educational agency or institution.

     F. Organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of, educational agencies or institutions
        to develop, validate, or administer predictive tests; administer student aid programs; or
        improve instruction. FCPS may disclose information only if the study is conducted in a
        manner that does not permit personal identification of parents and students by



                                                  11
                                                                    Fairfax County Public Schools
                                                               Student Scholastic Records Manual

        individuals other than representatives of the organizations, and the information is
        destroyed when it is no longer needed for the purposes for which the study was
        conducted. All studies by outside organizations or individuals involving the collection of
        student information must follow the requirements of Policy 1475 and Regulation 1475.

   G. Accrediting organizations to carry out their accrediting functions.

   H. In response to a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. FCPS must make a
      reasonable effort to notify the parent or eligible student of the order or subpoena in
      advance of compliance. Advance notice allows the parent or eligible student to seek
      protective action. The only circumstance in which advance notice will not be provided
      will be situations in which the court has ordered that the existence or the contents of the
      subpoena or the information furnished in response to the subpoena not be disclosed.
      See Section XII of this chapter.

   I.   To a court, if FCPS has initiated legal action against a parent or student or if a parent or
        student has initiated legal action against FCPS, and the records disclosed are relevant
        to the legal action.

   J. A party that has a need for such information to respond to a health or safety emergency.
      See Section IX of this chapter.

   K. A party whose request is limited to “directory information” and the parent or eligible
      student has not opted out of the disclosure. See Section VI of this chapter.

III. ACCESS VERIFICATION

FCPS will not release scholastic records to any party unless the principal or program manager
responding to the request is satisfied that the party seeking access is authorized. Any person
seeking access to student records may be required to provide appropriate identification, such as
a driver’s license or military identification card. In situations where an unfamiliar person is
asserting that he or she is the parent of a student, custody orders and birth certificates may be
useful in confirming the person’s relationship to the student. Schools may also contact the
enrolling parent and/or the student who may be able to confirm the identity of the requester.

IV. CONSENT FORMAT AND USES

A written consent to disclose student scholastic records must be a signed document that:
        •  Identifies the student;
        •  Specifies the records to be disclosed;
        •  States the purpose of the disclosure;
        •  Identifies the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made.

No particular format is required so long as the written consent is signed and contains the
necessary elements. Parents and eligible students may use SS/SE-79, Release of Student
Records Authorization form to provide written consent for student record disclosures. If the
written consent does not identify specific records to be disclosed, access will be given to all of
the student’s centrally maintained student files (see Chapter 2 for additional information). FCPS
may contact the requester to seek clarification if the request is ambiguous. If the requester
agrees to restate or narrow the request, a staff member should document the revision of the
request and provide a copy to the requester.


                                                 12
                                                                   Fairfax County Public Schools
                                                              Student Scholastic Records Manual


Parents and eligible students may use a single written consent to authorize disclosure to several
parties. Parents and eligible students also may use a single written consent to authorize a party
or parties to have continuing access to the student’s scholastic record. In either case, the
signed consent must conform to the above requirements.

V. ACCESS RECORDKEEPING

SS/SE-94, Record of Disclosure of Student Record form is a log used to document access to
information in a student’s education record when the access is by anyone other than:
       • The parent or eligible student;
       • A school official;
       • A party with written consent from the parent or eligible student;
       • A party seeking directory information.

No entry shall be made, however, when the disclosure is in response to a court order or
subpoena that specifies that the subject of the records should not be notified. The form should
be initiated at the first such request for access or disclosure and updated to reflect subsequent
disclosures. The form and any written consents must be maintained in the student’s record.
Any unauthorized disclosure of student information must be recorded on this form.

VI. DIRECTORY INFORMATION

Directory information is routine information that generally is not considered harmful to disclose.
Consequently, this kind of information may be included in school publications and disclosed to
outside organizations without the parent’s prior written consent – unless the parent has opted
out of such disclosure.

The FCPS definition of “directory information” is set forth at the beginning of each school year in
the Annual Notice of Survey, Records, Curriculum, Privacy and Related Rights, and Opt-Out
Forms (the FCPS opt-out forms packet). For students currently enrolled in FCPS, the decision
to opt out of the release of directory information applies only to the current school year. If a
student withdraws or graduates from FCPS, however, FCPS will continue to honor the last opt-
out decision made while the student attended FCPS, unless FCPS is notified that the choice
has been rescinded.

Any disclosure of directory information must be made in accordance with the current school
year’s definition of directory information. Changes to the definition of “directory information”
may occur annually and are published in the opt-out packet. Therefore, it is important to review
the current version of the FCPS opt-out forms packet’s definition of directory information before
any information is released. The current version may be found on the FCPS public website at
https://www.fcps.edu/registration/opt-out-forms.

Federal law requires FCPS to release the names, address and telephone numbers of secondary
school students to military recruiters who request that information. Parents of the student (or the
student, once aged 18) may opt out of the release of this information. A parent decision to opt-
out of this release of information remains in effect until it is rescinded.

VII. RE-DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

FCPS discloses personally identifiable information from an education record on the condition
that the party to whom the information is disclosed will not “re-disclose” the information to any
other party without prior, written consent of the parent or eligible student. The third party who
receives the information may use the information only for the purposes for which the disclosure
was authorized. If FCPS determines that the third party improperly disclosed information from
scholastic records, FCPS may opt to not allow that third party access to personally identifiable
information for at least five years. Any violation of the re-disclosure restrictions should be
reported to FCPS Media and Crisis Communication.

The following statement should be included on all transcripts or other documents that convey
information from a scholastic record to a person or agency outside of FCPS:

“Information from the Fairfax County Public Schools student scholastic record is released on the
condition that the recipient agrees not to permit any other party to have access to such
information without the written consent of the parent or eligible student.”

VIII. SENDING COPIES OF STUDENT RECORDS

   A. To other prek-12 schools and school divisions

       Original records are not sent outside of FCPS. FCPS maintains the scholastic records
       created by or for FCPS; copies are provided to other schools requesting records.
       Consent from the parent or eligible student is not required to comply with a request for
       scholastic records from officials of another school division if the student seeks or intends
       to enroll there. The information is needed to determine the student’s placement and, in
       some cases, to alert the receiving school to disciplinary problems the student had in a
       previous placement. It is critical that schools send complete copies of scholastic records
       as soon as they are requested.

   B. To correctional facilities

       FCPS will provide copies of scholastic records to the requestor within five working days
       of receipt of the request when the request is received from the Department of Juvenile
       Justice, the Department of Correctional Education, or by a school division employee
       responsible for education programs in a local jail or a detention home when the student
       in question is now a student at the facility.
           •   Transcript(s) from all grade levels
           •   Most recent report card if a mid-year withdrawal and information does not appear
               on a transcript
           •   Immunizations
           •   Standardized test scores
           •   Most recent IEP
           •   Most recent 504 Plan
           •   Discipline incident reports that have occurred within the past 5 years

   C. To postsecondary institutions

       FCPS provides copies of transcripts with parent or eligible student release as provided
       for in the IS-111, Consent for Release of Student Records in Support of Postsecondary


                                                14

                                                               Student Scholastic Records Manual

       Applications: https://www.fcps.edu/sites/default/files/media/forms/is111.pdf. FCPS
       chooses to send discipline information only when an explicit separate release for that
       type of information is provided by the parent or eligible student, with the exception of
       situations that constitute a health and safety emergency, as outlined in Section IX of this
       chapter.

IX. HEALTH AND SAFETY EMERGENCIES

FCPS may disclose personally identifiable information from an education record, including
disciplinary records, without consent, to appropriate persons in connection with an emergency if
the knowledge of such information is necessary to protect the health or safety of a student or
other persons. The following factors should be taken into account in determining whether
records may be released:
         •  The seriousness of the threat to the health or safety of the student or other persons.
         •  The need for such records to meet the emergency.
         •  Whether the persons to whom such records are released are in a position to deal
            with the emergency.
         •  The extent to which time is of the essence in dealing with the emergency.

When assistance is needed, the principal or his or her designee may confer with the Region
Office in making this decision.

FCPS may disclose information regarding disciplinary action taken against a student for conduct
that posed a significant risk to the safety or well-being of that student, other students, or other
members of the school community to school officials in other school divisions and
postsecondary institutions, who have been determined by FCPS to have a legitimate
educational interest in the behavior of the student.

X. MISSING CHILDREN

When notified by a local law enforcement agency that a child is missing, the principal shall have
the student’s scholastic record updated to reflect that the child has been reported missing.
Upon receiving a request for copies of scholastic records of any student flagged as a missing
child, the school staff shall immediately contact the principal. The principal (or designee) shall
notify the law enforcement agency that reported the child as missing and identify the source of
the request for records of the missing child.

Whenever a school cannot obtain the scholastic record for any newly enrolled student and
school personnel suspect that the student is a missing child the principal shall notify local law
enforcement for investigation as a possible missing child. The principal may consult with the
Region Office before notifying law enforcement.

XI. RECORDS OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

Students’ special education records are guaranteed confidentiality under both FERPA and
IDEA. The director, Office of Special Education Procedural Support, is responsible for ensuring
the confidentiality of any personally identifiable information.

   A. Student special education records will be disclosed only as allowed by FERPA.

   B. Parents and their representatives (with the written consent of the parent) shall be given
      access to special education records upon request before any meeting regarding an IEP
      or any hearing.


                                                15
                                                                      Fairfax County Public Schools
                                                                 Student Scholastic Records Manual


       C. Reasonable requests for explanations of special education records, including
          standardized test protocols and results, shall be honored.

       D. Requests to inspect a current listing of the names and positions of the FCPS employees
          who may have access to personally identifiable information of a student receiving special
          education and related services may be referred to the Office of Special Education
          Procedural Support.

       E. Special education records are kept for active students and for five years after the student
          exits (graduates, withdraws, or completes a program) from FCPS. After five years,
          these records are destroyed in compliance with FCPS policy and applicable state
          records retention schedules.

       F. Students attending private schools located within Fairfax County or are home instructed
          (and remain residents of Fairfax County) who qualify for special education services, but
          do not receive these services from FCPS are entitled to reevaluations at least every
          three years or upon parent request. The scholastic record should be transferred, as
          necessary, to the school conducting the reevaluation, which then becomes the student’s
          last school of attendance. The five year retention period begins from the most recent
          date of eligibility.

XII.     RESPONSE TO SUBPOENA

FCPS will release student records (without consent) to comply with a judicial order or a lawfully
issued subpoena.

       A. When a judicial order or subpoena for student records is received, it shall promptly be
          referred to the Department of Special Services, Office of Operations and Strategic
          Planning, for response.

       B. Before any records are released in response to a judicial order or subpoena, the Office
          of Operations and Strategic Planning shall make a reasonable effort to provide notice to
          the parent(s) or eligible student. The purpose of this notice is to provide the parent(s) or
          eligible student the opportunity to ask the court to withdraw the request for records (this
          process is known as “filing a motion to quash”). Notice shall not be provided if the court
          order specifies that it has been issued “ex parte” or that the subject of the records shall
          not be notified.

       C. If a motion to quash has been filed, no further action will be taken to respond to the
          record request until the court has issued its decision.

XIII.    REQUEST FOR RECORDS NOT RELATED TO A SPECIFIC STUDENT

Non-scholastic records (including records that do not identify a specific student) may be subject
to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). An initial response to a FOIA request must
be made within five working days. Promptly provide a copy of any FOIA requests to the
attention of the FOIA officer in the FCPS Media and Crisis Communication. The FOIA officer will
prepare a response. Schools and offices will be expected to promptly provide responsive
documents to the FOIA officer and otherwise assist to ensure that responses are timely.

                                  CHAPTER 6 -
                   PROCEDURES FOR RELEASE OF STUDENT RECORDS


This chapter outlines step-by-step procedures to be followed when responding to requests for
access to records pertaining to a particular student. See the current version of Regulation 1501
and Chapter 5, Section XIII for information on how to process requests for non-student specific
information.

I.   DETERMINE THE DEADLINE FOR RESPONSE

     A. FCPS will attempt to comply with requests by parents or eligible students within five
        working days of the date the request was received. If the request cannot be processed
        within five working days, the parent or eligible student shall be notified of the need for
        additional time. A final response shall be provided no later than the FERPA mandated
        45 calendar days from the date the request was received.

     B. Responses to requests by anyone other than the parent or eligible student should be
        provided within 10 working days, but no later than the FERPA mandated 45 calendar
        days from the date the request was received.

II. CONFIRM THAT THE REQUESTOR HAS AUTHORITY TO ACCESS RECORDS

     A. Before any information is released in response to a request for student records, the
        requestor’s authority to access to the records must be verified. Chapters 4 and 5 explain
        the rights of parents, eligible students, and others to have access to student records.
        Any person seeking access to student records may be required to provide appropriate
        identification; a government issued photo ID is preferred. In situations where an
        unfamiliar person is asserting that he or she is the parent of a student, birth certificates
        or custody orders may be useful in confirming the person’s relationship to the student.
        Schools may contact the enrolling parent and/or the student to confirm the identity of the
        requestor.

     B. Any person other than a parent or eligible student who requests access to student
        records must provide either:
           1. a written consent signed by a parent or eligible student; or

            2. sufficient information for FCPS staff members to determine that the person may
                access the student’s records without the consent of a parent or eligible student.
                Refer to Chapter 5, Section I and Section II for guidance regarding the
                circumstances under which persons other than the parent or eligible student may
                access scholastic records without consent.

     C. Parents or eligible students may provide written consent for others to access scholastic
        records by:

            1. providing a signed document that identifies the student, specifies the records to
                be released, the reason(s) for release, and the names of the party or class of
                parties to whom records will be released; or




                                                 17
                                                                  Fairfax County Public Schools
                                                             Student Scholastic Records Manual

         2. completing SS/SE-79, Release of Student Records Authorization form.

             If the written consent does not identify specific records to be disclosed, access
             will be given to all of the student’s centrally maintained student files. The written
             consent must be maintained in the student’s cumulative file attached to the
             Record of Disclosure of Student Record, form SS/SE-94.

III. COLLECT AND REVIEW THE REQUESTED RECORDS

  A. When responding to a request for access to, or copies of, scholastic records, clarify what
     information is being requested if necessary. If the request is revised, document the
     revised request and provide the requester with a copy of the revised request so that he
     or she may correct if needed. You may need to identify and contact all FCPS schools,
     offices, and personnel likely to have the records requested.

         1. A student’s education record is not limited to the student’s cumulative file. See
             Appendix A and Chapter 8 for examples of other types of files that may contain
             the requested records which may be included in electronic information systems.

         2. Reminder: These records may include e-mails or documents kept in working or
             other files that, because of their lack of educational significance, would not
             ordinarily become part of the student’s scholastic record; however, if such
             e-mails or other documents have not been deleted or discarded prior to the time
             of the request, they must be provided, if specifically requested.

  B. Review records, before disclosure is granted, to determine whether any information must
     be withheld. Records, or portions thereof, should be withheld if:

         1. The consent does not authorize the information to be disclosed.
             Example: If a written consent specifies that only a limited type of records is to be
             disclosed, such as a student’s grades and attendance records, only those
             portions of the student’s records that contain the type of information specified in
             the consent can be disclosed.

         2. The requested record includes only directory information and the parent or
             eligible student has opted out of its disclosure and the disclosure is not otherwise
             authorized by FERPA. See Chapter 5, Section II.

         3. The record contains information pertaining to more than one student and the
             requester is authorized to access information pertaining to only one of the
             students. For example, while FERPA grants parents the right to access records
             of their own child, it does not entitle them to records of other children. In this
             situation, any information about other students must be withheld by redacting that
             information, see Section III.C of this chapter.

         4. FCPS has notice of a valid court order that bars the release of the information or
             that limits the right of the parent or eligible student to authorize others to have the
             information.

         5. The record belongs to instructional, supervisory, administrative, or educational


                                               18
                                                                 Fairfax County Public Schools
                                                            Student Scholastic Records Manual

             personnel, is in the sole possession of the maker and is not accessible or
             revealed to any other person (except an individual substituting for the maker as
             an official temporary replacement). This is a FERPA exclusion and does not
             apply when responding to a subpoena, search warrant, discovery request, or
             other court order.

         6. The record is protected by the FCPS attorney-client privilege or the attorney
             work-product privilege.

  C. In cases where information must be withheld from only a portion of a document, the
     original document should be copied and returned to the file, see Section III.B.3, of this
     chapter. All information to be withheld should be redacted (“blackened out”) from the
     copy using a black marker. To ensure that the withheld information is completely
     obscured, the redacted document should be recopied. The copy of the redacted
     document is provided to the requestor along with the reason the information was
     withheld. The redacted document must be attached to the request filed in the student’s
     folder. The requester also must be informed of the reason for redaction (e.g., student
     record information of another student, personnel information, attorney-client privileged
     information).

IV. RESPONDING TO REQUESTS FOR IN PERSON INSPECTION

  A. Any person, other than an FCPS staff member inspecting student records must be
     supervised by staff.

  B. If parents or eligible students bring third parties with them to review records (for
     example, someone to help translate the documents), the parent or eligible student must
     provide a written consent authorizing the third party to access the student’s record.

  C. Staff members shall inform the person inspecting student records that information from
     the student scholastic record is released on the condition that the recipient agrees not to
     permit any other party to have access to such information without the written consent of
     the parent or eligible student. See Section V.B of this chapter.

  D. Appropriate staff members shall be available to provide explanation, interpretation, or
     translation of record content to parents, eligible students, or others authorized to access
     records.

V. REQUESTS FOR COPIES OF RECORDS

  A. All original FCPS documents must be maintained in the student’s record. Only copies
     may be provided in response to any request for records.

  B. The following statement must be included on all transcripts or other documents that
     convey information from a scholastic record to a person or agency outside of FCPS:

          “Information from the Fairfax County Public Schools student scholastic
          record is released on the condition that the recipient agrees not to permit
          any other party to have access to such information without the written
          consent of the parent or eligible student.”

                                                        Student Scholastic Records Manual

  C. FCPS may charge for copying student records. Charges will be calculated according to
     the fee schedule described in the current version of Notice 2701. No charge may be
     imposed for searching or retrieving student records requested by parents or eligible
     students.

VI. DOCUMENT RESPONSES TO REQUESTS

  A. SS/SE-94 Record of Disclosure of Student Record form should be placed in each type of
     file as outlined in Chapter 5, Section V.

                              CHAPTER 7 -
       PROCEDURES FOR AMENDMENT OF STUDENT RECORDS AND COMPLAINTS


A record may be amended if the information in the record is inaccurate, misleading, or violates
the privacy or other rights of the student.

FERPA requires only that educational agencies and institutions conform to fair recordkeeping
practices. FERPA and its complaint procedures cannot be used to override accepted standards
and procedures for making academic assessments, disciplinary rulings, placement
determinations, and other evaluations. Accordingly, the right to seek amendment of education
records cannot be used to challenge a grade, evaluation, or disciplinary sanction; it may only be
used to correct the inaccurate recording of this information. Parents or eligible students may
resolve questions pertaining to a current school year grade that they believe were incorrectly
recorded through discussion with the teacher who awarded the grade. Parents or eligible
students may resolve questions pertaining to a disciplinary record by following the appeal
procedure outlined in the current version of the Student Rights and Responsibilities (SR&R).

I.   AMENDMENT PROCESS

     A. Parents or eligible students must provide a written request for amendment of the
        scholastic record to the principal where the student is currently (or was most recently)
        enrolled. The request must identify:
           •   The applicable student;
           •   The record in question;
           •   The specific information that the parent or eligible student believes should be
               changed;
           •   In what way the record is inaccurate, misleading, or violates the privacy or other
               rights of the student.

     B. The principal will review the material provided by the parent or eligible student, may use
        other FCPS held information in the decision-making process, and may consult with the
        creator of the record. If the record in question contains specialized information (for
        example, a psychologist’s report), the principal will consult with the professional who
        prepared the information or another qualified professional if the creator is unavailable
        prior to making a decision on amending, updating, or removing the information. If the
        principal and the professional are not in agreement as to the decision, the principal will
        consult with the professional’s supervisor prior to making any changes in the record. If
        the record in question was created at a different FCPS school the principal should
        consult with the appropriate administrator at the previous school, whenever feasible,
        prior to making a determination regarding the accuracy of the record.

     C. The principal shall provide the parent or eligible student with a written decision within ten
        business days after the request is received.

     D. If the principal decides that the scholastic record should be amended, the record in
        question may be:

            1. replaced with an updated version of the record;
            2. changed to reflect the correct information; or



                                                 21
                                                                   Fairfax County Public Schools
                                                              Student Scholastic Records Manual

           3. removed completely from the scholastic record.

   E. If the principal decides that the scholastic record should not be amended, the principal or
      designee will provide the parent’s or eligible student the decision in writing setting forth
      the reasons for the decision and an explanation of the parent or eligible student’s right to
      appeal the decision. See Appendix B for sample letter. A copy of the written decision
      will be placed in the student’s file along with the record at issue.

II. APPEAL PROCESS

Parents or eligible students may request a hearing to appeal a decision not to amend the
scholastic record.

   A. A request for a hearing shall be provided, in writing, to the appropriate FCPS Region
      Office. The request must identify:

           •   The applicable student;
           •   The record in question;
           •   The specific information that the parent or eligible student believes should be
               changed;
           •   An explanation of why the parent or eligible student disagrees with the initial
               decision to deny the request for amendment.

   B. The FCPS Region Office, or a designee for the Region Office, will hold a hearing no later
      than 45 days after receipt of the request unless the parent or eligible student agrees to a
      later date. The person conducting the hearing (decision maker) must not have been
      involved in the creation of the record in question or have a direct interest in the hearing’s
      outcome. The decision provided by the Region Office, or a designee of the Region
      Office, is final.

       The parent or eligible student shall be notified in writing at least three business days in
       advance of the date, time, and place of the hearing.

   C. The hearing is informal and is limited to determining if the challenged record or
      information within the record is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student’s
      privacy or other rights.

   D. The parent or eligible student may, at his or her own expense, be assisted by another
      person, including an attorney.

   E. Either party may present witnesses and/or documentary evidence relevant to the issue.

   F. Within ten business days of the hearing, a written decision should be issued. The
      decision shall be based solely on evidence presented at the hearing and must include a
      summary of the evidence and the reasons for the decision. Any documentary evidence
      presented by the parent or eligible student shall be attached to the written decision.

   G. If the decision maker agrees that the scholastic record should be amended, the record in
      question may be:

           •   replaced with an updated version of the record;


                                                22
                                                                Fairfax County Public Schools
                                                           Student Scholastic Records Manual

        •   changed to reflect the correct information; or
        •   removed completely from the scholastic record.

H. If the decision maker decides that the scholastic record should not be amended, the
   decision maker will provide the parent or eligible student a written decision setting forth
   the reasons for the decision and notice of the parent or eligible student’s right to place a
   statement in the record commenting on the contested information and/or stating why he
   or she disagrees with the hearing decision.

I.   The written decision along with any attachments and/or statement from the parent or
     eligible student shall be placed in the student’s record and shall be maintained as long
     as the record is maintained. If a statement is submitted, it shall be provided along with
     the contested record whenever the latter is disclosed.

                                                               Student Scholastic Records Manual

                                MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE


I.   RECORDS COLLECTION

It is the responsibility of the principal or the program manager to ensure that scholastic records
are developed, maintained, and stored in a confidential manner in a secure location where they
are not accessible to persons other than school officials who are authorized to access the
records. The principal or program manager has discretion to establish how records will be
stored within the school or office so as to best accommodate the needs of staff members to
access records to perform their professional responsibilities and to make use of the resources
available for storage.

     A. Recommendations Regarding Organization of Records

        FCPS is required to maintain certain records for each of its students. In addition to
        those records, FCPS creates and maintains many other types of records specific to each
        student. Chapter 8, Section II, provides an overview of some of the types of student
        records that may be maintained, and the typical file names associated with those types
        of records.

     B. Recommendations Regarding Storage

        Hard copy records must be maintained in storage that physically protects the records
        and restricts access to authorized individuals. The best method to protect scholastic
        records against damage or loss is to store them in a designated locking records room
        within locking metal cabinets. If this is not possible, other recommended methods of
        protecting records include storage within locked cabinets, desks, or rooms. When
        scholastic records are maintained electronically, it is essential to maintain secure control
        over system passwords, employ system protection features, and back up data regularly.
        Please reference FCPS Regulation 6225, FCPS Information Security Policy, for
        additional information.

II. TYPES OF STUDENT FILES

A cumulative file and a school health room file must be created for each student. Other types of
files specific to the student also may be created as the need arises. The files may be kept
together or may be stored in various locations, as needed, to permit necessary access and to
maintain security. Student records may also be maintained electronically (in the current student
information system and electronic systems) or may be stored in files outside of the standard
files described in Section II of this chapter (for example, teacher working files). Records relating
to a student are still part of the student scholastic record regardless of where they are
maintained and the retention period remains unchanged.

     A. Cumulative File

        Each FCPS student must have a cumulative file. This file serves as the primary
        scholastic record folder for the student and is used to hold academic, registration, test,
        and administrative records. A record of access log must be maintained in this file. See



                                                 24
                                                              Fairfax County Public Schools

B. Health File

   A health file is maintained for each student that contains items such as the Clinic Card,
   Emergency Care Information form, Health Information form, Medication Authorization
   forms, Health Information Progress Notes, and Assessments. See Appendix A for more
   information.

C. Disciplinary File

   Disciplinary records are those that document any disciplinary action taken against a
   student for violation of the Student Rights and Responsibilities (SR&R) or school rules or
   policies. Disciplinary records must be maintained as part of a student’s education
   record. See Appendix A for more information.

     children by a parent or parents, guardian, or other person having control of such child or
     children, as a full-time alternative to attendance in a public or private school. The Office
     of Operations and Strategic Planning shall maintain records of the educational programs
     of home instructed students in Fairfax County, as required by the Code of Virginia,
     including annual notification by the parents of their intent to provide home instruction and
     supporting documentation, including curriculum and evidence of educational growth and

J. Hearings Office files – maintained by the Hearings Office

     1. Referral for Disciplinary Action

        For serious violations, the principal may choose to make a referral to the Division
        Superintendent to conduct a hearing in order to consider more serious disciplinary
        actions (to include a long-term suspension, a reassignment, and/or a
        recommendation to the School Board for expulsion). For the most serious violations
        (including those involving certain weapons, illegal drugs, sexual assault, and assault
        on a school employee causing injury), the principal is obligated by School Board
        policy to make a referral to the Division Superintendent. The packets submitted in
        support of the referral, in addition to the decision letter(s) issued subsequent to the
        hearing, are maintained by the Hearings Office.

     2. Notices of the Filing of a Petition

        Virginia courts provide notice to the Hearings Office whenever a petition is filed
        alleging that an FCPS student has committed one of several enumerated crimes.
        Such notices are maintained by the Hearings Office and do not become part of the
        student’s disciplinary or scholastic record unless FCPS takes disciplinary action
        against the student based upon the incident that formed the basis for the filing of the
        petition. Generally, the information contained in or derived from such notices is
        confidential. The Hearings Office may notify the principal of the school in which the
        student is enrolled of the filing of the petition and the nature of the offense. The
        principal may disseminate the information to school personnel who have direct
        contact with the student and need the information to ensure physical safety or an
        appropriate educational placement or services.

     3. Notices of Court Disposition

         Virginia courts are required to send notices of adjudication or conviction for certain
         offenses to the school division a student attended at the time of the disposition, or if
         not enrolled at that time, at the time of the offense. Such notices are maintained by
         the Hearings Office and do not become part of the student’s disciplinary or scholastic
         record unless FCPS takes disciplinary action against the student based upon the
         incident that formed the basis for the adjudication or conviction.

III. SCHOLASTIC RECORDS HANDLING

  A. Transfer to another FCPS School

     When a student transfers to another FCPS school, the original scholastic record (all
     components, not just the cumulative file) should be sent to and maintained by the
     receiving school. FCPS is responsible for the transfer of scholastic records between
     FCPS schools. The files are not to be given to parents or students for delivery to the
     receiving school.

  B. Transfer to a Non-FCPS School

     FCPS retains the originals of all scholastic records. Only copies may be sent to the
     receiving school. Records released for a student transferring to a non-FCPS school
     shall include transcripts from all grade levels, the most recent report card if information is
     not included on the transcript, immunization records, full test history report from SIS,
     most recent IEP (if applicable), most recent 504 Plan (if applicable), and a record of any
     discipline incidents that have occurred within the past five years. No release of records
     authorization is required for FCPS to provide copies of scholastic records to another
     PreK-12 school where the student is enrolled or plans to enroll.

  C. Withdrawal to a Private School or Home School within Fairfax County

     Records shall be maintained at the last school of attendance for the duration of the
     natural tenure of the student. All special education records will then be transferred with
     the naturally matriculating student records to the school of attendance by last known
     address. As FCPS is responsible for maintaining the eligibility of all identified students
     within the local educational agency, accurate records of special education student
     withdrawal, reason for withdrawal, and triennial due dates must be maintained and
     processed with the records of the vertically matriculating student records.

  D. Periodic Review

     Student scholastic records should be reviewed (at a minimum) when the student
     changes school levels within FCPS or transfers to another FCPS school. At this review,
     documents that are no longer educationally useful should be removed and destroyed in
     accordance with the record retention schedules detailed in Appendix A. Report cards
     may be destroyed only if all the grades on the report card are reflected on the student’s
     transcript.

     Note: No records are to be destroyed if there is an outstanding request for either access
     to, or copies of, the records, the records are part of an incomplete audit, or the records

                                                         Student Scholastic Records Manual

   are relevant to a pending or ongoing investigation or threatened, pending, or ongoing
   litigation.

E. Update Activities

   1. Schools should generate an updated transcript and file in the cumulative file
      whenever a student:

          •   transfers to another FCPS school,
          •   withdraws,
          •   graduates,
          •   completes a special program, or
          •   otherwise exits FCPS as a student.

   2. Schools should generate an updated full test history report from SIS and file in the
      cumulative file whenever a student:

          •   transfers to another FCPS school,
          •   withdraws,
          •   graduates,
          •   completes a special program, or
          •   otherwise exits FCPS as a student.

  3. The cumulative file and all SS/SE-94 Record of Disclosure of Student Record forms
     should be transferred to Document Management for long-term storage after a student
     has been separated from FCPS for five years. When preparing the cumulative file for
     transfer, ensure the file contains:

          •   A final transcript that:
                 is legible and contains current information,
                 is in the correct student file (right student in the right folder),
                 reflects all classes taken and grades earned (including summer school),
                  and
                 identifies the student’s exit status (graduation, withdrawal, or completion
                  of program).
          •   An updated full test history report from SIS.

       After the cumulative file is transferred to Document Management, other scholastic
       record components for the student will become eligible for destruction at the start of
       the new school year. See Appendix A for more information about when other
       scholastic records are eligible for destruction.

F. Records Retention and Destruction Requirements

   Records retention times are established by the Library of Virginia in accordance with the
   Virginia Public Records Act. Retention times establish how long we must keep various
   records before we destroy them. Destruction at the end of the retention period is
   mandatory unless there is an open request to access the records, the records are part of
   an incomplete audit, or the records are relevant to pending or ongoing investigation or
   threatened, pending or ongoing litigation. Completion of form RM-3 prior to destruction
   is required to establish that the records may be destroyed as planned and then to
   document that destruction did occur as required.

FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)

1. What is the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)?

   The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law designed to protect
   the privacy of a student’s scholastic records. It is also known as the Buckley Amendment.
   FERPA grants parents and students who are eighteen years of age or older or attending a
   post-secondary institution the right to review the student’s education records and to request
   the amendment of a record if the parent or the student believes that it is inaccurate,
   misleading or in violation of the student’s privacy rights. The law applies to any public or
   private educational agency or institution that receives federal funds under any programs
   administered by the U.S. Department of Education. All public schools, including FCPS, are
   covered by FERPA.

2. Does FERPA control which records must be maintained as part of a student’s
   scholastic record and how long the records must be kept?

   No, FERPA controls the confidentiality of and access rights to scholastic records. It does
   not dictate which records must be maintained and for how long. Those questions are
   answered by the Virginia Public Records Act, Va. Stat. Ann. §§ 42.1-76, et seq. (Virginia
   Public Records Act), the Management of the Student’s Scholastic Record in the Public
   Schools of Virginia, 8 VAC 20-150-20 (Guidelines for the Management of the Student's
   Scholastic Record in the Public Schools of Virginia), and the Records Retention and
   Disposition Schedule No. 21 (Library of Virginia - Records Retention and Disposition
   Schedule) issued by the Library of Virginia. Chapter 8 of this manual provides information
   about the requirements of those laws and regulations.

3. How does FERPA protect the confidentiality of scholastic records?

   The general rule of FERPA is that all student scholastic records, and information derived
   from those records, are confidential. FERPA provides that student records may not be
   disclosed to anyone unless FERPA specifically allows the disclosure. FERPA allows
   schools to disclose a student’s scholastic records with the written consent of the student’s
   parents or of the eligible student. FERPA also specifically designates a limited number of
   other parties to whom FCPS may disclose a student’s scholastic record without the consent
   of the parent or eligible student. Chapter 5 of this manual lists the designated parties and
   describes the circumstances under which they may have access.

CONTENT OF STUDENT EDUCATION RECORDS

4. What are student education (scholastic) records?

   Student education or scholastic records are those records that are directly related to a
   student and are maintained by FCPS or by a party acting for FCPS. The content of the
   education record should be limited to data needed by the school to assist the student in his
   or her personal, social, educational, and career development, to provide a service, or
   comply with state or federal requirements.

   Education records (which may be collected orally, in writing, or by electronic means)
   encompass all records maintained by FCPS that contain information on a student, except
   those records specifically exempted by law. The term “education record” is used in FERPA


                                              31
                                                                     Fairfax County Public Schools
                                                                Student Scholastic Records Manual

     whereas “scholastic record” is used in the Code of Virginia. These terms are used
     interchangeably in this manual. See Chapter 3 for additional information.

5. What records are not considered education records?

     See Chapter 3, item 10.

6. Must a document identify a student by name in order to be an education record?

     No, a document can be considered “personally identifiable information” without identification
     of the student by name. A personal identifier includes any personal characteristics that
     would make the student’s identity easily traceable. For example, a student ID number,
     social security number, his or her initials, or other means.

7.   Are e-mails considered part of a student’s education record?

     Yes, See Chapter 3, item 1.

8. What is a sole possession record?

     See Chapter 3, item 10.

9. What are the attorney-client and attorney work-product privileges and how do they
   apply to records held by FCPS?

     The attorney-client privilege protects from disclosure any communications to, from, or with
     an attorney in which the client is seeking legal advice or the attorney is providing it. The
     attorney work-product privilege protects from disclosure any writing that reflects an
     attorney's impressions, conclusions, opinions, legal research, or theories. The purpose of
     these privileges is to encourage clients to freely share information with their legal counsel so
     that the attorneys can provide appropriate advice. This means that any FCPS records
     (including student scholastic records) that reflect communications between FCPS and its
     attorneys (Division Counsel and/or law firms employed by FCPS) or work-product of those
     attorneys shall not be disclosed to anyone who is not an FCPS school official with a need to
     know. Volunteers are not considered school officials for this purpose. Note that the
     attorney-client privilege only prevents disclosure of communication between FCPS and its
     attorneys. It is does not shield from disclosure communications from FCPS attorneys to
     parents’ or eligible student’s attorneys or representatives, or communications to FCPS from
     attorneys representing parents, students, or others.

10. What name should be used for a student in his or her scholastic record?

     See Chapter 3, item 4.

11. Should a school maintain copies of court orders or other documents relating to the
    custody of the student?

     When a child’s parents are divorced or separated, it is important for school officials to know
     whether either parent has been restricted or prohibited by the court from exercising parental
     rights. It is the responsibility of the parents to provide that documentation to the school and
     to keep the information current. See Regulation 2240. If an administrator is provided with a

   court order governing divorce, separation, custody or adoption, or a legally binding
   instrument that denies a parent access to a child or the child’s records, the administrator
   shall maintain a copy in the student’s file.

12. What are law enforcement records?

   For purposes of this manual, the term “law enforcement records” refers to those records that
   are created and maintained for a law enforcement purpose by the Office of Safety and
   Security, safety and security specialists, safety and security assistants, school resource
   officers, human resource investigators, and administrators specifically designated by a
   principal or program manager as designated members of the FCPS law enforcement unit.
   A law enforcement purpose includes ensuring the physical safety and security of people and
   property in FCPS buildings or grounds and/or the enforcement of any local, state, or federal
   law. Law enforcement records are neither considered disciplinary records nor scholastic
   records and will not be disclosed in response to a FERPA request.

   Note that copies of records provided by the law enforcement unit to school administrators
   that are then used for disciplinary or other educational purposes become part of the
   student’s scholastic record and may only be disclosed as allowed by FERPA. The copy
   maintained by the law enforcement unit remains exempt from FERPA and its disclosure
   prohibitions.

13. Are school health and medical records considered education records?

   Any student health and medical records that are maintained by the school are considered
   education records. This includes information created or maintained by the Public Health
   Nurse or by FCPS service providers (e.g., physical or occupational therapists, psychologists
   and social workers, athletic trainers) in school health room files, special education files,
   counseling files, or in student activities and athletic program files.

   These records are protected under FERPA, not the Health Insurance Portability and
   Accountability Act (HIPAA). (HIPAA is a federal law that requires the adoption of security
   and privacy standards to protect the confidentiality of medical records and other personal
   health information). HIPAA specifically excludes education records from the scope of its
   coverage. Therefore, any disclosure of student health and medical records must be
   authorized by FERPA.

14. Are test protocols considered to be scholastic records?

   Test protocols that do not contain personally identifiable information are not scholastic
   records. Test instruments and interpretive materials that do not contain the student’s name
   are not considered to be directly related to the student. However, if test protocols contain
   personally identifiable information about the student, then they are scholastic records that
   parents have a right to review; however, parents do not have the right to copy them.

   For students evaluated for or receiving special education, the Individuals with Disabilities
   Education Act (IDEA) requires a school to provide, upon request, an explanation, or
   interpretation of any answer sheet or other scholastic records related to the tests a student
   has completed. If requested, an explanation of the test protocols also must be provided.

PARENT AND ELIGIBLE STUDENT RIGHTS

15. Who is considered a “parent?”

   See Chapter 2, Parent.

16. Does divorce or separation affect a parent’s FERPA rights?

   No. As specified by Section 20-124.6 of the Code of Virginia and FERPA, FCPS shall give
   full rights to either parent, unless FCPS has been provided with evidence that there is a
   court order or other legally binding document that specifically prohibits access to education
   records. It is the responsibility of the party who is seeking to restrict the parent’s access to
   education records to obtain and to provide a court order to FCPS. See Regulation 2240.

17. What if one parent objects to the other parent’s exercise of his or her FERPA rights?

   See Chapter 4, Section IV.

18. Do stepparents or other caregivers have rights to access scholastic records under
    FERPA?

   The access rights of stepparents that reside with the student are addressed in Chapter 2,
   Parent. Stepparents who do not reside with the student and other caregivers do not have
   access to student education records unless a parent, a legal guardian, or an eligible student
   has consented in writing to that access. The written consent may specify that the
   stepparent or other caregiver be granted access on a continuing basis.

   In exceptional circumstances, a stepparent that does not reside with the student or other
   caregiver may be granted access to student education records without consent if the
   stepparent or other caregiver is “acting as a parent in the absence of a parent or guardian.”
   For this exception to apply, the parent must be absent from the day-to-day home
   environment of the child. Every effort should be made to obtain consent from a parent
   before access to student scholastic records is granted.

   A stepparent or caregiver may also be allowed access to student education records without
   written consent if they have a need to know in health and safety emergencies. Chapter 5,
   Section IX.

19. Do parents of students over 18 years of age have rights under FERPA?

   See Chapter 4, Section IV.B.

20. Who is an “eligible student?”

   See Chapter 4, Section V.

21. What rights exist for a parent or eligible student to inspect and review scholastic
    records?

   See Chapter 4, Section IV.B.

22. Do students have the right to inspect their scholastic file?

   Parents control access to the student scholastic file until the student becomes an eligible
   student. Students may, however, be provided with their completed work assignments,
   report cards, and other communications concerning their own progress in school.

23. How does FCPS inform parents and eligible students of their rights regarding student
    education records?

   FCPS provides notice to parents and eligible students of their rights under FERPA at the
   beginning of each school year through the Annual Notice of Survey, Records, Curriculum,
   Privacy and Related Rights and Opt-Out Forms and Explanations (the FCPS opt-out forms
   packet). This information is also available in multiple languages, see Chapter 1.

24. How does FCPS respond to requests by parents or eligible students to inspect or
    review the student’s scholastic records?

   See Chapter 6 for more information.

25. May FCPS charge a fee for copies of scholastic records?

   See Chapter 4, Section III.

26. May an educational agency withhold scholastic records, including report cards,
    because of nonpayment of fees?

   No. Section 22.1-6 of the Code of Virginia states that public schools may not withhold any
   student’s scholastic record, report card, or diploma because of nonpayment of any fee or
   charge.

27. May a parent or eligible student request amendment of the student’s scholastic
    record?

   Yes, see Chapter 7.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION FROM STUDENT SCHOLASTIC RECORDS

28. May FCPS disclose personally identifiable information from scholastic records to
    parties other than the parent or eligible student?

    See Chapter 5, Section I and Section II.

31. How may a parent or eligible student provide written consent to authorize a third
    party to have access to the student’s scholastic records?

   See Chapter 6, Section II. C.

32. Sometimes schools are contacted by persons or organizations who, on the parents’
    behalf, are seeking to obtain information or to engage in a dialogue about the student.
    Such third parties might include congressional representatives, advocacy
    organizations, attorneys, or medical personnel. Example: A civil rights advocacy
    organization acting on behalf of and at the request of the parents sends a letter to the
    school principal alleging that the school has taken discriminatory action against the
    student and demanding an explanation. How may the school respond to such
    requests to discuss with or provide student information to such third parties?

   In this situation, the school must have the written consent of a parent or eligible student
   before it may provide information about the student to the requestor. It is not enough that the
   requestor has received informal or oral consent from the parents or eligible student to draft
   the letter. See Chapter 5, Section IV, for additional information on written consents. Staff
   members may pursue either of two options to obtain this written consent: (1) Staff may
   contact the parent or eligible student and request that he or she provide written consent to
   allow FCPS to disclose student record information to the third party; or (2) Staff may
   respond directly to the third party acknowledging receipt of the communication and
   requesting that the third party provide FCPS with the written consent of a parent to allow a
   substantive response, including student record information, to be provided. Staff may use
   the following language in its response to third parties requesting such information:

       This is to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated ___. Please understand that the
       Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 USC 1232g, (FERPA) requires FCPS to
       maintain the confidentiality of information and records about its students. FERPA allows
       that a parent may authorize a third party, to have access to a student’s educational
       record or information derived therefrom by providing a signed and dated written consent
       to the student’s school. Enclosed please find a copy of form SS/SE-79 which may be
       used for this purpose. Upon receipt of this completed consent form, FCPS will be able to
       provide you with a response to your inquiry. Please note any student record information
       that is provided to you pursuant to a written consent may be used only for the purpose
       stated in the consent and may not be re-disclosed by you without the consent of the
       parent. Thank you for your cooperation.

   Staff members should not include any other information about the student, or any details
   about the questions raised in the third party’s letter, until the written and signed consent has
   been received.

   Although the disclosure of student specific information is prohibited until a written consent is
   received, staff members may provide the third party with other general information about
   FCPS practices and procedures if appropriate. Example: An advocate contacts the school
   at the request of a parent complaining about discipline imposed on a specific student and
   alleging that FCPS fails to provide students with adequate notice of school rules. Until
   written consent from the parents is received, staff members may not disclose any
   information about the student’s disciplinary incident. Staff may, however, provide the third
   party with a copy of the Student Rights and Responsibilities booklet and an explanation of
   how FCPS disseminates this information to all students.

33. May a parent or eligible student provide a “blanket consent” to disclosure?

   Yes, FCPS allows parents and eligible students to, in a single consent form, authorize
   disclosure to several parties. Parents and eligible students also may use a single written
   consent to authorize a party or parties to have continuing access to the student’s scholastic
   record. In either case, the signed consent must conform to FERPA’s requirements as
   outlined in Chapter 5, Section IV.

34. What conditions apply to disclosing directory information?

   Directory information is defined in Chapter 2. Public disclosure of directory information may
   be made in various ways, see Chapter 5, Section VI.

35. Are schools required to disclose “directory information” to military recruiters?

   Yes, unless the student (if over 18 years of age) or parent has opted out of the disclosure,
   see Chapter 5, Section VI.

36. Does the child abuse reporting statute override FERPA protections?

   Yes. Section 63.1-1509 of the Code of Virginia requires a teacher or other person employed
   in a public or private school, kindergarten, or nursery school to report suspected child abuse
   or neglect immediately. All reports must be made within 24 hours after first learning of the
   suspected abuse or neglect. The Child Protective Services (CPS) child abuse hotline
   number is 703-324-7400. The Virginia state Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline number is 800-
   552-7096. Reports may be made in one of two ways: (1) the employee may notify the
   principal of the child’s school and the employee and principal may contact CPS jointly; or (2)
   the employee may report directly to CPS and provide the principal of the child’s school with
   notice of the report after it has been made. See Regulation 2115.

   The federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) provides an exception to
   FERPA that authorizes school personnel to disclose student records and information
   derived therefrom as necessary to ensure that such reports are made.

   If CPS requires student records subsequent to the initial report or as part of an investigation
   not initiated by an FCPS report, student records may only be disclosed as set forth in FAQ
   #38, below. Staff members may share personal observations and information not derived
   from student records in response to CPS inquiry without meeting the conditions described in
   FAQ #38.

37. Must FCPS disclose the name of a staff member who has filed a report of child abuse
    or neglect with Child Protective Services to a parent or parent’s representative?

   No. The identity of the reporter is not considered a FERPA record subject to disclosure
   even if the name has been made part of a record maintained by FCPS. Such information is
   also exempt from disclosure under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act pursuant to
   section 2.1-3705.1(1) of Code of Virginia.

38. May FCPS disclose a student’s education records to the Department of Child
    Protective Services (CPS), to a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA), to a court-
    appointed guardian ad litem (GAL) or other court appointed service provider?

   With the exception of the disclosure to CPS addressed in FAQ # 36 and Regulation 2115,
   CPS workers, CASA workers, court-appointed guardians ad litem or other service providers
   (for example, a psychologist appointed by the court to evaluate the student) may have
   access to student education records under the following conditions:

      •   They present a court order, subpoena, or other legally binding document granting
          such access; or
      •   A parent has provided a written consent authorizing such access; or
      •   The information is needed to enable the requester to handle an emergency situation
          that poses a serious threat to the health or safety of the student or others (See
          Chapter 5, Section IX); or
      •   The request is for directory information.
      •   CPS workers are permitted access to education records of students currently in
          foster care.

   There are state statutes that specify that CPS and CASA may have access to student
   records. Because the requirements of FERPA take precedence over those state statutes,
   those statutes cannot be used to authorize disclosures that FERPA would not allow.

39. May FCPS disclose student education records to law enforcement agencies such as
    the Fairfax County Police Department, without written consent?

   Law enforcement agencies may have access to student education records under the
   following conditions:

      •   They present a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or other legally binding
          document granting such access; or
      •   The information is needed to enable the law enforcement personnel to handle an
          emergency situation that poses a serious threat to the health or safety of the student
          or others; or
      •   The request is for directory information.

   There is a state statute that specifies that state or local law enforcement or correctional
   personnel, including a law enforcement officer, probation officer, or administrator, or a
   member of a parole board may have access to student records in the course of his or her
   duties. Because the requirements of FERPA take precedence over that state statute, the
   state statute cannot be used to authorize disclosures that FERPA would not allow.

   FERPA does allow, however, probation officers of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations
   court to have access to student records if one of the following conditions are met: (1) written
   parental consent; (2) a court order authorizing the probation officer to have such access; or
   (3) FCPS has been provided with a completed copy of the “Juvenile and Domestic Relations
   Court Services Unit Request to FCPS to Release Student Record Information.” The
   disclosure must be recorded on the student’s Record of Disclosure of Student Record,
   SS/SE-94 form and the form must be maintained in the student’s cumulative file.

40. What recordkeeping requirements exist concerning requests and disclosures?

   See Chapter 5, Section V.

41. What limitations apply to the re-disclosure of information?

   See Chapter 5, Section VI.

42. What conditions apply to disclosure of information in health and safety emergencies?

   See Chapter 5, Section IX.

43. How does FCPS respond to a subpoena for student records?

   See Chapter 5, Section XII.

44. How does FCPS respond to a request for information that does not concern a specific
    student?

   See Chapter 5, Section XIII.

   Example: A member of the public requests information pertaining to enrollment projections
   for the upcoming school year. The request is not a FERPA request because it does not
   pertain to records of individual students. The requester is seeking information that may be
   accessible under the FOIA. A response should be coordinated with the Office of Media and
   Crisis Communication.

   Example: A parent submits, to his child’s school, a request for copies of his child’s special
   education records. The parent also requests information about a recent school board
   meeting at which funding for a special education program was discussed. The request for
   the student’s records falls under the FERPA and should be processed by the school in
   accordance with procedures set forth in Chapter 6 of this manual. The request for
   information about a school board meeting constitutes a FOIA request because it does not
   involve information specifically concerning the parent’s child. A response to that portion of
   the parent’s request should be coordinated with the Office of Media and Crisis
   Communication.

45. How long does FCPS maintain student scholastic records?

   The Library of Virginia issues the Records Retention and Disposition General Schedule No.
   21, which sets rules regarding how long schools must retain certain types of student
   records. The retention schedule varies depending on the type of record. Appendix A of this
   manual provides more information about how the Records Retention and Disposition
   Schedule applies to scholastic records maintained by FCPS.

                   ORGANIZATION OF STUDENT SCHOLASTIC RECORDS


The following tables are useful in determining which documents are best kept within the various
files of the student scholastic record. The left column details the documents to be maintained in
a specific file. The column to the right defines how long the item is kept before destruction. This
list is not intended to be all-inclusive. The retention key can be found at the end of this section.

Documents marked with an * can be “batch filed" which means that a school may file together in
one place all of the records for that school year and purge them when replaced by a new set the
following year. However, the last copy received regarding a student should be retained in the
cumulative file.
