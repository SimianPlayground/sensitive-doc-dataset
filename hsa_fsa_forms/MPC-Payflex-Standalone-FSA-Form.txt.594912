For Health Care Flexible Spending Account: I certify that I, my spouse or eligible dependent have incurred each expense on this form. These expenses are for eligible medical care. They
are not for cosmetic reasons. I understand that “incurred” means the service has been provided.
For Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) members: I understand that an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rule only lets me use my HRA for eligible individuals if they’re covered by a
compliant group health plan*. I certify that the patient noted on my claim (myself, spouse, or eligible dependent) is covered under my Employer’s group health plan or another compliant group
health plan*. I have received and read the printed material regarding the reimbursement accounts and understand all of the provisions. *The group health plan must be compliant with the
Affordable Care Act (ACA). It can’t have annual or lifetime dollar limits on essential health benefits. And it can’t exclude coverage because of pre-existing conditions.
For Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account: I certify that I have incurred the Dependent Care expenses for me and, if married, my spouse to work or attend school. These expenses
are for my Qualifying Person (dependent). These qualify as eligible expenses under my plan and are not for educational expenses to attend kindergarten or higher. I understand that “incurred”
means the service has been provided. This is regardless of when I am billed or charged for, or pay for the service. I acknowledge that I will have to report the caregiver’s name, address and
Tax Identification Number on Internal Revenue Service Form 2441.
I have not received reimbursement for any of these expenses. I will not seek reimbursement elsewhere, including from a Health Savings Account (HSA). If I receive reimbursement, I and (if
married) my spouse will not claim these same expenses on our income tax return. I have received and read the printed material for the plan. I agree to all of the terms and conditions of the
plan. Any person who, knowingly and with intent to defraud, files a statement of claim containing any material false, incomplete or misleading information is guilty of a crime.
