         Financial Information and Authorization to Process Insurance Claims


It is recommended that all USC students be covered by health insurance either with an individual
student policy or through their family policy. Patients and clients are responsible for all charges incurred
by themselves or family members for services at Student Health Services (SHS). Examples of charges
include lab tests, x-rays, prescriptions, physical therapy, vaccinations, psychiatric services, and others.

Student Health Services will file insurance claims on behalf of patients and clients. A current insurance
ID card must be presented and maintained on file at Student Health Services in order to file claims with
your insurance plan. The filing of claims does not guarantee either full or partial payment by the
insurance company. Students remain responsible for any unpaid balances.

SHS is a participating provider only for the University-sponsored Student Health Insurance Plan by
BlueCross BlueShield of SC. SHS is not a participating provider for other health insurance plans,
including HMOs, TRICARE military and those covering USC or state employees and their dependents.

The Student Health Services Pharmacy is contracted and approved to file claims for many
insurance plans for prescriptions, whether written by SHS providers or others.
