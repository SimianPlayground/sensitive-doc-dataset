                                   Introduction/Purpose of Solicitation



The purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to enter into a fixed-price contract with a food
service management company (FSMC) that will provide New Heights Charter School (hereinafter
referred to as the school food authority [SFA]) with food service management assistance for their
food service operation. The FSMC will provide services to the SFA as described in the Scope of
Work in the Model Fixed-price Contract.

The SFA’s food service goals are to provide nutritious, high-quality meals to students and
participants in the following federal meal programs: breakfast, lunch, afterschool snack and
seamless summer to accommodate special diets where medically necessary, improve the
nutritional quality of meals, and maintain a financially viable food service program. General food
service goals are to


       •   Provide an appealing and nutritionally sound program for students as economically as
           possible

       •   Stimulate both student and adult participation in the program through improved relations
           with students, staff, and the community by creating awareness of the direct correlation
           between adequate nutrition for students and their ability to learn

       •   Increase participation at all levels of the food service program by improving meal quality,
           seeking student and parent input, offering menu variations, and improving planning

       •   Maintain reasonable prices for students and adults participating in the food service program

       •   Maintain student and staff morale at a high level

SFAs shall conduct all procurement transactions in a manner that provides maximum open and
free competition consistent with Title 2, Code of Federal Regulations (2 CFR), Part 200.319(a)(1-
7). The SFA must share with every Respondent all information necessary for submitting a
competitive proposal. The release of this RFP, evaluation of Respondents, and award of a contract
will use competitive bidding standards established in all applicable California state and federal
statutes and regulations.

Outlined below are competitive bidding basic standards:

       •   The purpose of soliciting competitive proposals is to secure public objectives in the most
           effective manner and avoid the possibilities of graft, fraud, collusion, etc.

       •   The SFA released this RFP to benefit the SFA and not the Respondents.

       •   Fulfillment of RFP specifications is based on full and fair competition and acceptance by the
           SFA of the most responsive and responsible Respondent to the SFA’s requirements, as
New Heights Charter School
RFP 5
Page 1
         determined by the SFA when evaluating proposals based on the criteria contained in the
         RFP.

    •    The RFP must provide a basis for full and fair competition among Respondents to a
         common standard, free of restrictions that tend to stifle competition.

The above four points are for illustrative purposes only, and do not include all California state and
federal requirements to achieve competitive bidding.

To respond to this RFP, interested FSMCs must present evidence of experience, ability, and
financial standing necessary to meet the requirements stated in this RFP. The SFA will measure
this evidence by scoring the proposals, using a point system that will rank each proposal from
highest to lowest, to determine which proposals they will consider for the award of a contract.

To be competitive in this solicitation, the Respondent must:

    •    Carefully read the entire RFP, attachments, exhibits, addenda, and SFA responses to
         questions before submitting a proposal

    •    Ask appropriate questions or request clarification before the deadline in the RFP

    •    Submit all required responses by the required deadlines

    •    Follow all instructions and requirements of the RFP thoroughly and appropriately

If a Respondent discovers any ambiguity, conflict, discrepancy, omission, or other errors in this
RFP, the Respondent shall immediately notify the SFA of the error in writing and request
clarification or a modification of the RFP. If the Respondent fails to notify the SFA of the error prior
to the date for submission of proposals, and is awarded the contract, the Respondent shall not be
entitled to additional compensation or time by reason of the error or its later correction.

    26. The SFA will not consider more than one proposal from an individual, firm, partnership,
        corporation, or association under the same or different names. Reasonable grounds for
        believing that any Respondent has submitted more than one proposal for work
        contemplated herein will cause the SFA to reject all proposals submitted by the Respondent.

        may copy these forms. A proposal is considered responsive if it follows the required format,
        includes all attachments, and meets all deadlines and other requirements outlined in this
        RFP.

    30. The SFA shall not accept proposals after the submission deadline specified in the RFP and
        shall return the unopened proposals to the respective Respondents. The SFA will not
        consider late proposals under any circumstances.

    31. Respondents are responsible for examining the entire RFP package, seeking clarification for
        any item or requirement that may not be clear to them, and checking all responses in their
        proposal for accuracy before submitting it.

    32. Respondents may submit their questions regarding the information presented in this RFP to
        Jamie Parada in writing by postal mail at 2202 MLK Blvd, LA, CA 90008, e-mail at
        jparada@newheightscharter.org, or fax at 323-508-0156, no later than May 23rd, 2018. The
        SFA will answer all questions received by the deadline in writing without exposing the query
        source. This will be the sole process for asking and answering questions regarding this
        RFP. Respondents may not contact SFA employees directly to ask questions.

    33. SFA representatives reserve the right to inspect a Respondent’s other food service
        operations prior to any award of a contract.

    34. The SFA reserves the right to negotiate the final terms and conditions of the contract, which
        may differ from those contained in the proposal, provided the SFA considers such
        negotiation to be in its best interest. Any change in the terms and conditions must not create
        a material change, which is any alteration or modification to the original terms stated in the
        RFP that would have resulted in different proposals from all respondents. A material
        change will require the SFA to rebid the contract.

    35. Meal Samples to Taste: Respondents may bring samples to New Heights Upper Campus,
        3989 S. Hobart Blvd, LA 90062 for tasting. Meal samples should be part of the 21-day meal
        cycle. Please call New Heights to coordinate delivery of samples. If respondent chooses not
        to submit a sample, New Heights will rely on food references to judge food quality.

    36. Respondents shall submit two paper copies and one copy in digital format (e.g., CD, DVD,
        flash drive, etc.

             a. The paper copy must contain the original signature of the individual(s) authorized to
                bind the Respondent contractually and be labeled “Master Copy.”

             b. The Respondent must ensure the digital copy is complete and inclusive of all
                materials contained in the paper copy, including any required signatures. If there is
                an inconsistency between the paper and digital copies, the paper copy will take
                precedence.

             c. The sealed proposal envelopes must be marked legibly with the SFA’s RFP number
                and title, and the SFA name and address, as shown in the following example:

                                       Evaluation of Proposals

Proposals will be opened on or after the date and time specified in the Schedule of Events. During
the evaluation process, the SFA may ask Respondents to clarify information in the proposals, but
Respondents may not change their proposals.

An error in the proposal may cause the SFA to reject that proposal; however, the SFA may, at its
sole discretion, retain the proposal and make certain corrections. When determining if a correction
will be made, the SFA will consider the conformance of the proposal to the format and content
required by the RFP and that the Respondent's intent is clearly established based on review of the
whole proposal. Based on that established intent, the SFA may choose to correct errors such as
obvious grammatical or punctuation errors and arithmetic errors. The Master Copy of the proposal
shall have priority over additional proposal copies.

The SFA will open proposals to determine if they contain all the required information in accordance
with this RFP. The SFA will evaluate qualifying proposals using the following criteria:

Attachment D: FSMC Professional Standards


FSMC Employees Professional Standards

Federal Register Vol. 80, No. 40, dated March 2, 2015, referred to as the “Final Rule,”
establishes minimum professional standards for school nutrition personnel who manage
and operate the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. In the Final
Rule, the following definitions are established:

    1. School Nutrition Program Director. The school nutrition program director is
       any individual directly responsible for the management of the day-to-day
       operation of school food service for all participating schools under the jurisdiction
       of the school food authority.

    2. School Nutrition Program Manager. The school nutrition manager is any
       individual directly responsible for the management of the day-to-day operation of
       school food service for a participating school(s).

    3. School Nutrition Program Staff. School nutrition program staff are those
       individuals, without managerial responsibilities, involved in day-to-day operations
       of school food service for a participating school(s).

The Final Rule establishes that these definitions apply to the function/role rather than
the specific title within the school food service structure, and that the definitions apply
whether or not the school food service is operated by an FSMC. Therefore, as of the
effective date of this contract, the minimum professional standards established by the
Final Rule, and described therein, shall apply to FSMC staff performing any of the
duties described above.

The FSMC shall only place staff for work in the school district that meet the minimum
professional standards outlined in 7 CFR, Section 210.30, which can be viewed at the
following Web page:
http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/cn/profstandards_flyer.pdf.

    •    The SFA shall ensure that all staff the FSMC proposes for placement meet the
         minimum professional standards.

    •    The FSMC shall ensure their employees take the required annual training as
         outlined in the professional standards and provide certification of such training to
         the SFA. The FSMC shall remove from the SFA premises any staff who fail to
         take the required annual training.

    •    The FSMC shall provide the SFA with a list of proposed employees and evidence
         that they meet the professional standards.

          2. Unless otherwise required by law, the prices which have been quoted in this offer have not been
             knowingly disclosed by the offeror and will not knowingly be disclosed by the offeror prior to
             opening the case of an advertised procurement, directly or indirectly to any other offeror or to
             any competitor; and

          3. No attempt has been made or will be made by the offeror to induce any person or firm to submit,
             or not to submit, an offer for the purpose of restricting competition.

B.   Each person signing this offer on behalf of the offeror certifies that:

          1. He or she is the person in the offeror’s organization responsible within the organization for the

                CDE that it or any part of the bidding process has been determined noncompliant
                with state and federal laws and regulations (Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations [7

      C.       Fees

               1.   Fixed-price Contracts

               The SFA will pay the FSMC at a fixed rate per meal. The fixed rate per meal
               includes all fees and charges indicated in the Schedule of Fees (Exhibit B) of
               this Contract. The SFA must determine, and the FSMC shall credit the SFA
               for, the full value of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Foods. The
               FSMC’s fixed-price invoice will be fully compliant with procurement
               requirements for the National School Lunch, School Breakfast, and Special
               Milk Programs, set forth in Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations (7 CFR),
               parts 210, 215, and 220, and the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
               Final Rule issued Wednesday, October 31, 2007. The FSMC shall take
               discounts, rebates, and other credits into account when formulating their
               prices for this fixed-price contract (Title 2, Code of Federal Regulations [2
               CFR], sections 200 & 400).

               2.   Payment Terms

               The FSMC shall submit monthly invoices by the 10th day of the following
               month that reflect all activity for the previous calendar month. The FSMC
               must submit detailed cost documentation monthly to support all charges to
               the SFA. Charges and expenses are included in the Schedule of Fees
               (Exhibit B). All costs, charges, and expenses must be mutually agreeable to
               the SFA and the FSMC, and must be allowable costs consistent with the cost
               principles in 2 CFR, parts 200 or 400, as applicable. The SFA will pay
               invoices submitted by the FSMC within 21 business days days of the invoice
               date. The SFA will pay invoices received by its accounting department by the
               month, if the invoices pass the SFA’s audit (7 CFR, sections 210.14[a]
               210.19[a], 210.21[c][3]). The SFA will notify the FSMC of invoices that do not
               pass audit, which the SFA will not pay until the invoices have passed audit,
               with no penalty accruing to the SFA (7 CFR, sections 210.19[a][1], 210.14[a],
               210.21[f]).

                3. Interest, Fines, Penalties, and Finance Charges

                Interest, fines, penalties, and finance charges that may accrue under this
                contract are not allowable expenses to the nonprofit school food service
                (cafeteria fund). The SFA will not pay unallowable expenses from the SFA’s
                cafeteria fund (2 CFR, Section 200.449).

                4. Spoiled or Unwholesome Food

                The SFA shall make no payment to the FSMC for food that, in the SFA’s
                determination, is spoiled or unwholesome at the time of delivery, does not
                meet detailed food component specifications as developed by the SFA for

Page 3

RFP #5
                the meal pattern, or does not otherwise meet the requirements of this
                Contract (7 CFR, Section 210.16[c][3]).


                The SFA shall make no payment to the FSMC for meals that, in the SFA’s
                determination, are spoiled or unwholesome at the time of delivery, do not
                meet detailed food component specifications as developed by the SFA for
                the meal pattern, or do not otherwise meet the requirements of this Contract
                (7 CFR, Section 210.16[c][3]).

      D.       Contract Cost Adjustment

      The renegotiation of price terms under this Contract is permitted only upon the
      occurrence of unpredictable, unexpected conditions beyond the control of both
      parties. If those conditions create a significant and material change in the financial
      assumptions upon which the price terms of this contract were based, then those
      price terms so affected may be renegotiated by both parties. Renegotiation of price
      terms under such conditions must be mutual and both parties must agree on any
      changes in price terms. Any adjustments so negotiated and agreed upon must
      accurately reflect the change in conditions. The occurrence of contingencies that
      are foreseeable and predictable, but not certain, should be calculated into the
      defined price terms, to the extent possible, with the goal of minimizing the need for
      renegotiation of price terms during the term of the Contract. Substantive changes
      of the Contract will require the SFA to rebid the Contract.

       E.      Availability of Funds

      Every payment obligation of the SFA under this Contract is conditioned upon the
      availability of funds appropriated or allocated for the payment of such obligation.
      The SFA may terminate this Contract at the end of the period for which funds are
      available if funds are not allocated and available for the continuance of this
      Contract. In the event the SFA exercises this provision, no liability shall accrue to
      the SFA and the SFA shall not be obligated or liable for any future payments or for
      any damages resulting from termination under this provision.

       F.      Timeliness

      Time is of the essence in this Contract.

      G.       Approval

      This Contract has no force or effect until it is signed by both parties and is
      approved by the CDE (7 CFR, Section 210.19 [a][5]).

       H.      Amendment


Page 4
New Heights Charter School
RFP #5
      No amendment or variation of the terms of this Contract shall be valid unless made
      in writing, signed by both parties, and approved by the CDE. Any oral
      understanding or agreement not incorporated into the Contract in writing and
      approved by the CDE is not binding on either party (7 CFR, Section 210.19[a][5]).

      I.       Substantive Changes to Contract

      Any change to this Contract that results in a material change or any proposed
      renewals of this Contract may, at the determination of the CDE, either void this
      Contract or require the SFA to rebid the Contract. Following are examples of
      substantive changes that could require the SFA to rebid the Contract (2 CFR,
      Section 200.324 [b][5]):

                •   The addition of a program

                •   A major shift in responsibilities for FSMC/SFA staff

                •   A modification that changes the scope of the Contract or increases the
                    price of the Contract by more than the applicable federal, state, or local
                    small purchase threshold (2 CFR, Section 200.324 [b][4])

      J.       Subcontract/Assignment

      No provision of this Contract shall be assigned or subcontracted without prior
      written approval of the SFA.

      K.       Written Commitments

      Any written commitment by the FSMC relative to the services herein shall be
      binding upon the FSMC. Failure of the FSMC to fulfill any such commitment shall
      render the FSMC liable for damages due to the SFA. Such written commitments
      include, but are not limited to:

               •    Any warranty or representation made by the FSMC in any publication,
                    drawing, or specifications accompanying or referred to in the proposal
                    pertaining to the responsiveness of the proposal

                •   Any written notifications, affirmations, or representations made by the
                    FSMC in, or during the course of, negotiations that are incorporated into
                    a formal amendment to the proposal

       L.      Trade Secrets/Copyrights

      The FSMC and SFA shall designate any information they consider confidential or
      proprietary—including recipes, surveys and studies, management guidelines,
      operational manuals, and similar documents—that the SFA and FSMC regularly

Page 5
New Heights Charter School
RFP #5
      use in the operation of their business or that they develop independently during the
      course of this Contract. Information so designated and identified shall be treated as
      confidential by the FSMC and the SFA, and the FSMC and the SFA shall exercise
      the same level of care in maintaining the confidences of the other party as they
      would employ in maintaining their own confidences, unless disclosure is otherwise
      required under the law. All such materials shall remain the exclusive property of
      the party that developed them and shall be returned to that party immediately upon
      termination of this Contract. Notwithstanding, the federal awarding agency
      reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce,
      publish, or otherwise use, and authorize others to use, the following for federal
      government purposes:

                •   The copyright in any work developed under a federal grant, subgrant, or
                    contract under a grant or subgrant (7 CFR, Section 200.315)

                •   Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee, or a contractor
                    purchases ownership with federal grant support (2 CFR, Section
                    200.315[B])

       M.      Severability

      Should any provision(s) of this Contract be declared or found to be illegal,
      unenforceable, ineffective, and/or void, then each party shall be relieved of any
      obligations arising from such provision(s). The balance of this Contract, if capable
      of performance, shall remain and continue in full force and effect.

       N.      Counterparts

      This Contract may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
      original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

      O.       Silence/Absence/Omission

      Any silence, absence, or omission from the Contract specifications concerning any
      point shall mean that only the best commercial practices are to prevail. Only those
      materials (e.g., food, supplies, etc.) and workmanship of a quality that would
      normally be specified by the SFA are to be used.

      P.       Indemnification

      The FSMC shall indemnify and hold harmless the SFA, or any employee, director,
      agent, or Board Member of the SFA, from and against all claims, damages, losses,
      and expenses (including attorney’s fees and court costs incurred to defend
      litigation), and decrees or judgments whatsoever arising from any and all injuries,
      including death or damages to or destruction of property resulting from the FSMC’s
      acts or omissions, willful misconduct, negligence, or breach of the FSMC’s

Page 6
New Heights Charter School
RFP #5
      obligations under this Contract by the FSMC, its agents, employees, or other
      persons under its supervision and direction.

      The FSMC shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless the SFA from any
      liability or damages arising from the SFA’s sole acts or omissions.

       Q. Penalties

      For the breach of the Contract and associated benefits:

      If the FSMC causes the breach, the FSMC assumes liability for any and all
      damages, including excess cost to the SFA in procuring similar services, and is
      liable for administrative, contractual, and legal remedies, as applicable.


      R. Small and Minority Businesses - Prime Contractors and Subcontractors

      (a) The non-Federal entity must take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that
      minority businesses, women’s business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms
      are used when possible. (b) Affirmative steps must include: (1) Placing qualified
      small and minority businesses and women’s business enterprises on solicitation
      lists; (2) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women’s business
      enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources; (3) Dividing total
      requirements, when economically feasible, into smaller tasks or quantities to permit
      maximum participation by small and minority businesses, and women’s business
      enterprises; (4) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits,
      which encourage participation by small and minority businesses, and women’s
      business enterprises; (5) Using the services and assistance, as appropriate, of
      such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Minority
      Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and (6) Requiring
      the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, to take the affirmative steps
      listed in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this section. (2 CFR, Part 200.321[a][b][1-6])

      	  	  
      S. The FSMC shall comply with the provisions referenced in Appendix II to 2

            c) Rights to Inventions Made Under a Contract or Agreement (if applicable)

    T. Force Majeure



Page 7
New Heights Charter School
RFP #5
    1. Neither party shall be liable to the other for delay in, or failure of, performance
       nor shall any such delay in, or failure of, performance constitute default if such
       delay or failure is caused by force majeure. Force majeure means an occurrence
       that is beyond the control of the party affected and occurs without its fault or
       negligence. Force majeure may include, but is not restricted to, acts of God, the
       public enemy, acts of the state in its sovereign capacity, fires, floods, power
       failure, disabling strikes, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, and freight
       embargoes.

    2. Force majeure does not include any of the following occurrences:

         •   Late delivery of equipment or materials caused by congestion at a
             manufacturer’s plant or elsewhere, or an oversold condition of the market

         •   Late performance by a subcontractor, unless the delay arises out of a force
             majeure occurrence

         •   Inability of either the FSMC or any of its subcontractors to acquire or maintain
             any required insurance, bonds, licenses, or permits

    3. If either party is delayed at any time in the progress of work by force majeure, the
       delayed party shall notify the other party in writing of such delay, as soon as
       practicable and no later than the following work day or the commencement
       thereof, and shall specify the causes of such delay. Such notice shall be
       delivered by hand or sent by postal mail with a certified return receipt requested
       and shall make a specific reference to this article, thereby invoking its provisions.
       The delayed party shall cause such delay to cease as soon as practicable and
       shall notify the other party in writing when it has done so. The time for completion
       shall be extended by contract amendment, as long as the amended period does
       not violate 7 CFR Section 210.16(d).

    4. Any delay or failure in performance by either party caused by force majeure shall
       not constitute default, nor give rise to any claim for damages or loss of
       anticipated profits.

       U.      Nondiscrimination

      Both the SFA and FSMC agree that no child who participates in the National
      School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), Summer Food
      Service Program (SFSP), or Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) will be
      discriminated against on the bases of race, color, national origin, age, disability,
      sex, gender identity, religion, reprisal, and where applicable, political beliefs,
      marital status, familial or parental status, sexual orientation, or all or part of an
      individual’s income derived from any public assistance program or protected
      genetic information in employment or in any program or activity conducted or

       funded by the USDA. (Not all prohibited bases will apply to all programs and/or
       employment activities (2 CFR, Section 210.23[b])

       V.      Compliance with the Law

       The FSMC shall comply with all laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations of all
       applicable federal, state, county, and city governments, bureaus, and agencies
       regarding purchasing, sanitation, health, and safety for the food service operations
       and shall procure and maintain all necessary licenses and permits. The SFA shall
       cooperate, as necessary, in the FSMC’s compliance efforts.

       The FSMC shall comply with 2 CFR, Part 200, 7 CFR, parts 210 (NSLP), 220
       (SBP), 225 (SFSP), 226 (CACFP), 245 (Determining Eligibility for Free and
       Reduced Price Meals and Free Milk in Schools) as applicable, 250 (Donation of
       Foods for Use in the United States, its Territories and Possessions and Areas
       Under its Jurisdiction, USDA FNS Instructions and policy, federal laws and
       regulations, California Education Code (EC), and California laws and regulations,
       where applicable.


       W.      Choice of Law

       This Contract shall be construed under the laws of the state of California, where
       applicable, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws. Any action or
       proceeding arising out of this Contract shall be heard in the appropriate courts in
       California.

       X.      Advice of Counsel

       Each party acknowledges that, in executing this Contract, such party has had the
       opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel and has read and
       understood all of the terms and provisions of this Contract (California Education
       Code [EC], Section 45103.5[b]).


III.   Relationship of the Parties

       A.      The FSMC’s relationship with the SFA will be that of an independent
               contractor and not that of an employee of or supervisor for the SFA. The
               FSMC will not be eligible for any employee benefits, nor will the SFA make
               deductions from payments made to the FSMC for taxes; all of which will be
               the FSMC’s responsibility. The FSMC agrees to indemnify and hold the SFA
               harmless from any liability for, or assessment of, any such taxes imposed on
               the SFA by relevant taxing authorities. The FSMC will have no authority to
               enter into contracts that bind the SFA or create obligations on the part of the
               SFA (EC Section 45103.5).

Page 9
New Heights Charter School
RFP #5
             B.      Where the SFA is a public school district or program operated by the county
                     Office of Education, the FSMC, as an independent contractor, shall have no
                     authority to supervise food service classified personnel operating the NSLP,
                     SBP, or Afterschool Meal Supplements (AMS) or Seamless Summer under
                     the NSLP (EC Section 45103.5).

             C.      All services to be performed by the FSMC will be as agreed between the
                     FSMC and the SFA. The FSMC will be required to report to the SFA
                     concerning the services performed under this Contract. The SFA shall
                     determine the nature and frequency of these reports.

             D.      The SFA is the responsible authority, without recourse to USDA or CDE, for
                     the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues
                     arising in any way from this Contract. Such authority includes, but is not
                     limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, claims, or other matters of a
                     contractual nature.


IV.       Food Service Program

              A.     Food Service Management Company Responsibilities


                     1.   The SFA participates in meal programs that require the use the nonprofit
                          food service funds, to the maximum extent practicable, to buy domestic
                          commodities or products for Program meals. A ‘domestic commodity or
                          product’ is defined as one that is either produced in the U.S. or is
                          processed in the U.S. substantially (51% or more by weight or volume)
                          using agricultural commodities that are produced in the U.S. as provided
                          in 7 CFR 210.21(d) and 220.16[d]).

                     2.   The Respondent will document why a non-domestic food is being
                          substituted for domestic foods. The documentation is intended to
                          indicate if the alternative food is due to the cost of domestic being
