Some dwarves have an even greater affinity for illusions than the average member of their race, bringing prestige to a class known as the shadowcraft of a magician. Race: Gnome Skills: Bluff 4 rank, Hide 4 rows Of Feats: Spell Focus (illusion) Spells: The ability to cast at least three spells of illusion, including at least one shadow spell of level 4 or higher.
Weapons and Armor Profession: Shadowcraft wizards get no skill with any weapons or armor. Spells of the Day /Spells Famous: At each level, the shadow ship magician receives new spells per day (and spells are known if applicable) as if she also received a level in the spell class to which she belonged before adding a level of prestige grade. It does not,
however, get any other benefit the nature of this class would have received (an improved chance of turning or destroying the undead, metamagic or the subject of creating feats, and so on). If she had several classes of spells before she became a shadow ship magician, she must decide which class to add each level to determine the spells of the day and the
known spells. Shadow cloak (Su): The shadow ship magician can mask his shape in the shifting shadows. This ability gives her a variable amount of concealment depending on her level. While her shadow cloak is active, attacks on the shadow ship magician have a chance to miss the equal of 15% and 5% on the class level (maximum 40% at level 5).
Darkvision and the faint illumination vision offer no help in piercing the cloak of shadows, although any creature that can see in the magical darkness can ignore the chance to miss out as can a creature with a true vision. A shadow craft magician can dismiss or renew this effect as a free action. While her shadow cloak is active, the shadow magician can
make hide checks as if she are concealing. The shadow cloak does not function in daylight, and it is the equivalent of the third-level darkness effect for interacting with light spells. Silent illusion (opposite): Once the shadow magician reaches Level 2, all spells from the school of illusions it casts no longer require a verbal component, as if the feat of the Silent
Spell had been applied to them. The levels and times of casting these illusion spells do not change, however. If the shadow ship magician casts spells of illusion that cannot be affected by the feat of the Silent Spell (for example, if a character throws a bard), this ability does not affect those spells. Shadow Illusion (Su): Starting from Level 3, the shadowcraft
magician is able to infuse some of its fruits (see list below) with material from the shadow plane, making them partially real. The school of these spells varies from fruit to shade. The shadow art magician can use a modified spell to imitate Wizard's witchcraft or witchcraft (call), witchcraft (creation) or resurrection spell is at least one level lower than the spell of
illusion. The modified spell functions identically a shadow spell or a shadow spell, except that the power of the spell is 10% per level of the spell used. For example, a shadow ship magician who uses a silent image to create an acid splash will inflict 10% of the normal damage on a creature that succeeds in its order so as not to believe the shadows. If it used
a pre-programmed image to simulate a monster V challenge, the creature would have 60% of the points of hitting a normal creature of its kind, and its damage would be 60% normal against a creature that succeeds at saving the Will to avoid believing. The shadow ship magician can apply the shadow illusion to any of the following fertility spells: a silent
image, a minor image, a basic image, a permanent image, and a programmed image. Extended Illusion (Ex): Once the shadow mage reaches Level 4, the duration of any spell of illusion it casts, or the ability similar to the spell from the school of illusions it uses, doubles as if the feat of the Extended Spell had been applied to it. However, the levels and times
of casting these spells and spelling do not change. This ability stacks with the effect to extend the spell feat, which still changes the effective level of the spell. Powerful Shadow Magic (Su): When the shadow mage reaches Level 5, the power of effects created by its shadowy sorcery, shadow evocation, greater shady sorcery, big shadow exclamation and
spells of shades increases by 20%. That is, these spells are an additional 20%, likely affect unbelieving creatures and inflict 20% more damage. This bonus also applies to figue spells converted into shadow spells through the power of shadow illusion (see above). Adapting Kabala to the gnome illusionists can certainly use this class of prestige; simply replace
the racial requirement with the requirement that shadow craft magazines be members of bondage. The requirement for a level 4 spell from a shady under-school limits this class of secret charmers. Were it not for this requirement, clergymen with a trickery domain could claim more easily than wizards and sorcerers. Promotion Level BAB Fort Ref will special

For the most advanced magicians The crafts of illusion become a substitute for reality, and the shady things they conjure up are shaped as realistically as the real thing.
Content of the show Character should be a gnome with 4 rows in Bluff, 4 4 in Hide and the ability to cast at least three spells of illusion, including one shadow spell of the 4th level above. SkillsEdit Shadowcraft wizards get 4 basic points in each level. Power: No Dexterity: Hide, Move SilentLy Constitution: Concentration of Intelligence: Knowledge (Arcana),
Search, Spelling Wisdom: Spot of Charisma: Bluff, Masking, Perform Class BasicsEdit Hit Die: d4 BAB: 1/2 Level Saves: Fort Bad, Ref Bad, Will Good Spelling: Class FeaturesEdit Cloak ShadowEdit Starting from Level 1, Attacks on Magic Shadowcraft suffer a chance to miss an equal 15% 5%/level (maximum 40% at level 5) In addition, the mage of the
shadow ship is allowed at any time to do hide checks, as if they were hiding. A creature that can see through the magic darkness can ignore this chance. The cloak does not work in daylight, and for the purposes of light spells, it is considered the effect of darkness of the 3rd level. The magic can dismiss or activate this ability as a free action. Silent IllusionEdit
On Level 2, a shadow magician can cast illusion spells without a verbal component (unless these spells indicate that they must have a verbal component, such as bards). Shadow IllusionEdit On the 3rd level, the shadowcraft magician can fill certain spells of the fruit with the shadow of things, making them partly real. The shadowcraft magician can use a
modified spell to mimic any witchcraft (creation or call) or to exclaim a level spell up to one level lower than the spell. The cast in this way functions as a shadow spell or shadow spell, except that the power of the simulated spell is 10% at the level of the figure spell used. The shadow ship magician can apply this effect to the following shape spells: a silent
image, a minor image, a primary image that preserves the image, and a programmed image. Advanced IllusionEdit On level 4, the duration of any spell of illusion or spell as the ability of the shadowcraft magician throws doubles. This effect can fit with the effects of extend Spell feat. Powerful shadow MagicEdit On the 5th level, the shadow power of the
shadow magic of the shadow magician increases. Spells shadow witchcraft (and more), shadows evocation (and more), and shades have their effect increased by 20%: they are 20% more likely to affect unbelieving beings, and they do 20% more harm. This also applies to spells altered with the shadow illusion ability that the capes acquire at level 3. Bardal
SilverwhisperEdit Bardal is a male dwarf sorcerer 8/ Shadow Magician 2, which is chaotic well. Ok.
