of the proposers.

the District.

accuracy of the following statements:
            a. Represents that to the best of its knowledge it is not indebted to the Comal Independent School District.

            b. Certifies that no suspension or debarment is in place, which would preclude receiving a federally funded
                 contract.
            c. Section 44.034 Subsection (a) of the Texas Education Code requires a person or business entity that
                 enters into a contract with a school district must give advance notice to the district if the person and/or an

                 general description of the conduct resulting in the conviction of a felony. Subsection (b) states "a school
                 district may terminate a contract with a person or business entity if the district determines that the person
                 or business entity failed to give notice as required by Subsection (a) or misrepresented the conduct
                 resulting in the conviction. The district must compensate the person or business entity for services
                 performed before the termination of the contract.” Subsection (c) this notice is not required of a publicly
                 held corporation.
            d. "Non-Collusion Statement": "The undersigned affirms that they are duly authorized to execute this service

                 communicated by the undersigned nor by any other employee, agent and/or representative of the
                 company, corporation, firm, partnership, etc., or individual to any other person engaged in this type of
                 business prior to the official opening of this bid for the intent or purpose of collusion.”
            e. The undersigned attests that they are a duly authorized employee by their company to bind said company
                 to the prices offered and to the terms and conditions of this bid.
            f. No employee of the District shall have a direct financial interest in any contract with the district, nor shall
                 any employee have a direct financial interest in the sale of any land, equipment, supplies, materials, or
                 service. Any violation of this policy will render the contract null and void unless such contract is approved
                 by the Comal ISD Board of Trustees after full disclosure. Therefore, vendor shall note any and all
                 relationships that might be a conflict of interest and shall include such information with the bid/bid
                 response.

This district has implemented a “no contact” policy during the bidding process. This means that from the date
the solicitation is issued until the date the bid is awarded by the board, there shall be no contact by any vendor
to any district employee (excluding the Chief Financial Officer and Director of Purchasing) or board member in
relation to this bid, unless authorized by the Director of Purchasing. The undersigned attests that no employee or
representative of the company has violated C.I.S.D.’s “No Contact” policy.

                       SUSPENSION AND DEBARMENT CERTIFICATION



Federal Law (A-102 Common Rule and OMB Circular A-110) prohibits non-federal entities from
contracting with or making sub-awards under covered transactions to parties that are suspended
or debarred or whose principals are suspended or debarred. Covered transactions include
procurement contracts for goods and services equal to or in excess of $100,000 and all non-
procurement transactions (e.g., sub- awards to sub-recipients).

Firms receiving individual awards of $100,000 or more and all sub-recipients must certify that their
organization and its principals are not suspended or debarred by a federal agency.

Before an award of $100,000 or more can be made to your firm, you must certify that your organization
and its principals are not suspended or debarred by a federal agency.

I, the undersigned agent for the firm named below, certify that neither this firm nor its principals are

      licenses, etc. may be used to define processes, procedures, or performance expectations; however, this
      supporting/backup information/documentation does not take precedence over the solicitation document and/or
      documents identified as Contract Documents.

75.   Contract Documents and Order of Precedence - Contract Documents are the documents that comprise the
      basis of
      contractual agreement between the District and the successful Offeror. In the simplest contracts, Contract
      Documents include the District’s solicitation document (RFP, IFB, RFO, RFQ, etc.); the Offeror’s response to the
      solicitation document; and the notice of award or acceptance by the District. In more complex contracts, Contract
      Documents may be identified in the District’s notice of award or acceptance and may include the District’s
      solicitation document (RFP, IFB, RFO, RFQ, etc.); the Offeror’s response to the solicitation document; the
      District’s request for Best and Final Offer (BAFO); the Offeror’s response to the BAFO; and the notice of award
      or acceptance by the District.

          a) Offeror will ensure the District’s terms and conditions, statement of work/specifications, and Contract
             Documents order of precedence flow-down to Offeror’s subcontractors, agents, and/or third-party

             may provide additional information and/or documentation to facilitate accomplishment of the Contract’s
             SOW/Specifications in the form of administrative procedures, processes, flow charts, templates, etc.;
             however, these additional documents (especially imbedded comments or general references terms,
             conditions, SOW/Specifications) do not change nor replace existing Contract language nor do they
             supercede or change precedence of the Contract Documents. Any attempt by the Offeror and/or its

78.   Criminal Background Check – All vendors, contractors and their subcontractors hereinafter called (“service
      contractor”), must comply with the requirements of Senate Bill 9, promulgated by the 80th Legislature of the State
      of Texas. The requirements apply to service contractors whose employees, hereinafter called (“covered persons”),
      will have continuing duties related to the contracted services and who will have direct contact with students. Such
      service contractors who employ a covered person will have to conduct criminal background checks on those
      employees who are covered persons. If the covered person was hired by the service contractor before January 1,
      2008, the service contractor must certify to the District that the service contractor has obtained the criminal history
      record information from any law enforcement or criminal justice agency or a private consumer reporting agency
      governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C 1681 et seq. for the covered person. A covered person is
      considered to have been employed by a service contractor as of the date the covered person first provided services
      for compensation.

      If the covered person was hired on or after January 1, 2008, the employer shall obtain the criminal history record
      information through the criminal history clearinghouse maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety as
      provided by Government Code 411.0845. A covered person is considered to have been offered employment as
      of the date the covered person accepted an offer from the service contractor for a specific job position or a
      specific project that is to begin on a date that is certain or reasonably ascertainable. For covered persons hired
      on or after January 1, 2008, fingerprinting and photographing of the covered person may be necessary.

      DEFINITIONS:

      Continuing duties related to the contracted services shall mean work duties that have been or will be
      performed on District property on a regular and repeated basis, rather than on a one time or infrequent basis.
      Covered person shall mean an individual who is not an applicant for or a holder of a certificate under Education
      Code Chapter 21, Subchapter B; is employed or offered employment by a service contractor, or is an
      independent contractor of the District and who has or will have continuing duties related to the contracted
      services and who has or will have direct contact with students. The covered person also includes a minor who is
      not a student of the District. Service Contractors shall mean vendors, independent contractors and their
      subcontractors, and third part service providers who are compensated by the District for services rendered.
      Direct contact shall mean verbal or physical interaction with one or more students that is necessary for the
      performance of contracted services, or that provides substantial opportunity for unsupervised interaction with
      students. Student contact that is incidental to the performance of contracted services, including incidental
      contact that results from services that do not provide the opportunity for unsupervised interaction with a student
      or students, such as addressing an assembly, officiating a sports contest, or judging an extracurricular event, is
      not direct contact with students. Disqualifying Conviction shall mean a felon offense under Title 5, Penal
      Code; (these are offenses against the person, such as criminal homicide, kidnapping and unlawful restraint,
      trafficking of persons, sexual offenses and assaultive offenses); an offense for which a defendant is required to
      register as a sex offender under Chapter 62, Code of Criminal Procedure; or an equivalent offense under federal
      law or the laws of another state if, at the time of the offense, the victim was under 18 years of age or was
      enrolled in a public school.

      SERVICE CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES:

      A service contractor shall obtain all required criminal history record information, as described above, that related
      to a covered person employed by the service contractor or a subcontractor of the service contractor. If a service
      contractor determines that a person who provides any of the contracted services is not a covered person
      because the person does not have continuing duties related to the contracted services, or does not have direct
      contact with students, the service contractor shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that such persons do not in
      fact have continuing duties or direct contact. A service contractor shall certify, using a District provided form, to
      the District that is has obtained all criminal history record information related to covered persons, and that is has
      taken reasonable steps to ensure that its employees who are deemed not to be covered persons do not have
      continuing duties related to the contract services or direct contact with students. A service contractor shall not
      permit a covered person to provide services at the District if the covered person has a disqualifying conviction.

      document are estimates only and not necessarily purchased by this contract. Specific quantities will be noted on
      subsequent purchase/delivery orders issued under this contract. If the District’s requirements do not result in

      impossible, to compute with certainty, and does not constitute a penalty. Assessment of liquidated damages does
      not preclude CISD from seeking and obtaining other remedies as set forth in this solicitation or any other remedy
      at law or in equity available to CISD.

      commercial warranties available to any customer for same or similar supplies or services.

      evaluation, and/or resulting contract to CISD’s Director of Purchasing. Bidder/Offeror/Proposer/Vendor or agents

Part Five - Specifications:
INTRODUCTION

The Comal Independent School District is seeking qualified vendors to provide an integrated school management software solution
comprised of both an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Student Information System (SIS) system that will meet the needs
of the District. This RFP is designed to provide interested parties with sufficient basic information to submit proposals meeting
minimum requirements, but it is not intended to limit a proposal’s content or exclude any relevant or essential data. Vendors are at
liberty and are encouraged to expand upon the specifications to evidence product capabilities.


STATEMENT OF WORK

Comal Independent School District (hereafter referred to as “the District” or “CISD”) to obtain proposals for an integrated school
management software solution for both an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Student Information System (SIS) system; system
integration services; technologies that support both ERP and SIS systems; and strategies designed to optimize ERP and SIS system
benefits. The District is seeking a fully scalable solution for use by District staff. The District currently uses the internet based Texas
Computer Cooperative Software (iTCCS) hosted by the Education Service Center, Region 20.

This RFP is intended to provide evaluations for an ERP and SIS integrated platform system. It allows a vendor flexibility in proposing
the most appropriate and cost-effective system they can provide. The District intends to accept and evaluate proposals from vendor(s)
whose overall solution best meets the District’s needs over immediate and long-term.

The objective is to fully update the District with modern business system functionalities and data integration for enterprise level
processes, dashboards and reporting. The system must be able to scale as appropriate to handle an increase of users if needed and/or
required. The system must be robust to handle a full capacity load with transaction processing at any one given point in time.

The preferred solution should be an All Solutions Provider (ASP) hosted environment (Cloud based, Dedicated Servers, etc.) or Software
as a Service (SaaS). The implementation of this platform must be a turn-key installation. The system must be fully scalable, provide
enhanced interoperability, and interface with an open application programming interface (API) architecture to third party vendors. The
District’s technology direction is to pursue an open API architecture environment and the appropriate configuration for the proposed
solution with connectivity to existing software(s), should be included.

The proposed system is required to meet, gather, store and export all current data reporting formats for the Texas PEIMS submissions
(Fall, Mid-Year, Summer and Extended submissions). The proposed system is required to stay up to date on all mandatory Federal and
State business, student and data reporting requirements requested of the District for Federal and State compliance, as those needs change
and expand.

CISD's overall goal in soliciting a Vendor is to provide the highest level of service and satisfaction to students, faculty, and staff,
while providing system flexibility. The District may award to other than the lowest cost solution in favor of exceptional customer
service, superior technical solution and overall best value to the District.

The vendor is expected to provide the hardware and software to provide a fully functional system, meeting all specifications listed and
other specifications furnished during the RFP process.

Support Services are required for the assessment, planning, implementation and maintenance of all products being acquired via this
RFP. The vendor’s staff performing such services must have attended formal training on the product(s) offered. Proof of certified
training may be requested. The vendor must provide technical support for our system administrators for the implementation and
support of the product(s) listed. Any costs associated with this service(s) must be included in the set forth price.

The vendor must provide detailed planning; specifically, the vendor must:
1.      Arrange an initial meeting Tuesday, September 3, 2019 to gather relevant parties and discuss project scope and roles.
2.      Perform site assessments to discuss existing infrastructure and gather scope requirements.
3.      Develop a phased implementation plan.
4.      Develop a phased training plan.
4.      Provide a list of required and recommended hardware for implementation of the products purchased, if applicable.
5.      Provide a list of required and recommended software for implementation of the products purchased, if applicable.

The vendor must provide “ownership of data”, in terms of the District requiring all data elements and data tables that populate this
proposed system. A data dictionary of the data elements and data tables must be provided to the District. Vendor shall provide, at no
cost to the District an automatic data extraction and transfer capability that is set on a regular schedule(s) determined by CISD to

                                                                                                                                          31
                                                                                       RFP 19-13 School Management Software
transfer the existing environment to the new platform. The transfer must be done on a secure encrypted protocol (i.e. daily exported
double-quote Comma Separated Value (CSV) files over a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)) or some other secured methods of
data transfer using an open API structure.

Consideration will be given to the vendor that provides:
   • a comprehensive, cost-effective, single-vendor solution for current specifications, future scalability and capacity
        requirements, ongoing service and support and who has been certified by the South Texas Multiregional Processing Center
        (STMRPC) for interface to the student accounting system (Appendix A).
   • an all-inclusive system that meets the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) data reporting requirements for the Office of
        Civil Rights (OCR) reporting every two years.

The acceptance of a proposal does not obligate CISD to purchase a system from any vendor. CISD reserves the right to reject all
proposals and not make a decision. All costs for preparation and system demonstration(s) are the responsibility of the vendor. After
receipt of the proposal, and prior to signing the contract, CISD reserves the right to modify requirements or service level agreement
elements and/or add or delete specific features, options or requirements.

Any purchase made via this RFP is contingent upon funds availability and CISD Board of Trustees’ approval; no purchases are
guaranteed. If an award is made, CISD intends to award this RFP to a single vendor. CISD reserves the right to purchase all or a
portion of the items listed on proposal. Prices quoted must be valid through the entire Board of Trustee’s review and approval
process.


Demonstrations
Demonstrations of the product(s) being proposed may be required of the finalists being considered. The vendor will also be required to
provide dedicated consultant(s) for the purpose of demonstration of their product(s) at CISD. The demonstrations will be held at a CISD
location to be announced at a later date. All associated costs for the demonstrations and consulting services are on the behalf of each
vendor and will be at their expense. CISD must be allowed to test the demonstration software. If further requested, the demonstration
software must be made available for a given timeframe to be reviewed by CISD staff, to make an informative decision in the RFP
process. Additionally, the selected vendor may be required to attend the Board meeting when the recommendation is submitted for the
Board of Trustees approval.


Network Infrastructure Compatibility
The software must be able to operate on the current CISD network infrastructure. If needed, the software can be installed on server
hardware set inside the District for evaluation purposes during the RFP process for vendor finalists. All features of the software must
be operational without any modifications to any computer hardware and/or network equipment. The software must operate fully on a
100 Mbps Ethernet local area network and an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) wide area network, as appropriate.


Costs
All proposals must include all costs associated (direct or indirect) to provide, install, setup, and make the software fully operational.
Any staff training (on-site and/or remote) must also be included in the overall costs. Vendors should also include expenses related to
travel, meals, hotel lodging, phone calls, and any other expenses to be incurred as part of the installation, setup and support efforts. Any
costs related to designing and developing a seamless data interface or API will be the responsibility of the vendor. Furthermore, any
costs related to making the interface function as prescribed after the system is implemented is the responsibility of the vendor until
proper functionality is achieved.

Payment Schedule
The District will make two (2) equal payment installments, one at the midpoint and another at the completion of the initial installation
and services. The final payment will be withheld pending successful implementation. The District will follow NET 60 payment terms
over the life of the Board approved proposed system terms.

Penalties for Nonperformance
All software in the initial order, including custom CISD interfaces required as part of this RFP, must be made operational within 90
calendar days of receipt of a purchase order. For every day past this time frame, the vendor agrees to extend free technical support, as
well as all other normal services associated with the company’s support program, for an additional month. Also, CISD reserves the
right to withhold final payment until the system is fully operational. Example: If the software arrives 10 days late, CISD will receive
10 additional months of free support, beyond that which is stipulated in the original proposal and/or CISD will withhold final
payment.

Acknowledged Constraints

CISD is a local governmental agency where its records can be considered public information but student and staff records are not public
information. The contractor should be aware that student and staff records are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act (FERPA) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The confidentiality of student and staff records must
be strictly preserved. The District requires for the vendor to accept, preserve and adhere to the Vendor Data Confidentiality Agreement
(VDCA) that accompanies the awarded contract. Failure to abide by these terms will result in breach of contract.

General Information
Vendors that respond must be able to meet all of the United States (federal) and Texas (state) mandated data and reporting
requirements listed in the RFP solicitation. This mandate also includes any future requirements both from the United States (federal)
and Texas (state) regulations that need to be incorporated into.

Vendors need to be present for meetings. In addition, all tasks performed need to meet the requirements of the RFP and be able to
support the district during normal operating hours 7:30AM – 6:30PM CST.

Emailed submissions will not be accepted. Only responses submitted in response to the RFP will be considered regardless of sole
source status.

If you are unsure of a requirement you may identify “assumptions” in your proposal.

CISD’s current ERP and SIS system is Region 20 Internet-based Texas Computer Cooperative Software (iTCCS). This product is
reaching its “End of Life”.

CISD currently has the following number of iTCCS users:

    •    1,890 (TX Gradebook only)
    •      509 iTCCS

CISD has 23,800 students per average annual enrollment.

Proposed software solution must be able to integrate with 3rd party products.

The license cost should be included in the proposal and please be specific to all licensing structures proposed.

One vendor will need to provide an integrated ERP and SIS solution to produce Texas mandated Public Education Information
Management System (PEIMS) reporting data.
