The following slides are designed to assist Virginia Small Businesses in applying for
the Economic Injury Disaster Loans offered through SBA.
.
WE WANT YOU TO HAVE A COMPLETE APPLICATION UP FRONT.
If the application is incomplete it will be set aside. You will be notified of what is
missing and it will stay there until they receive the new information; then YOU GO TO
THE BACK OF THE QUEUE!
So take your time and make sure it is complete. We will be here to assist where we
can, but given the district’s limited staffing, we can’t run through an entire application
with every Virginia business. We are working with the state and our partners to
provide more in-depth help.
Do not 2nd guess the process
                                Everyone Should Apply!!

• At this point you will just follow along and fill out the necessary forms, etc.
• If you are having trouble with first getting in, i.e. it is not recognizing the county and/or state :
      • Make sure you entered your type of business AND clicked on EIDL only under the “Are
         you applying for:” section..
      • Otherwise, please wait a while and try again. Disaster is moving as fast as it can, but
         each state and individual county needs to be entered. Like everything else with Covid-
         19, this level of activity was never anticipated.
