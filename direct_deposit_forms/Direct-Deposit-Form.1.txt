                                       Employee Direct Deposit Enrollment Form

            To enroll in Full Service Direct Deposit, simply fill out this form and send it, fax or email to
    J. Morrissey at 289 Broad Street Windsor, CT 06095, Fax: 860-640-6543 or email: sueo@jmorrissey.com.
   Attach a voided check for checking account – not a deposit slip. If depositing into a savings account, ask your
    bank to give you the Routing/Transit Number for your account. It isn’t always the same as the number on a
                        savings deposit slip. This will help ensure that you are paid correctly.

              Note: We are unable to split your direct deposit, it may only go into one account.

      Below is a sample check MICR line, detailing where the information necessary to complete this form can be found.
