                                                          How to file your health, wellness and vision claim

International Claims Services (ICS) must receive claims within 180 days of treatment to be eligible for reimbursement of covered expenses.
Claim forms should be submitted only when the medical service provider does not bill ICS directly, and when you have out-of-pocket expenses
to submit for reimbursement.

Claims Filing
The best way to file your claim is to submit it online at www.gbg.com. Log into the Service Portal, select “Health Claim Form”, and follow the
instructions to complete the online claim form. After submitting the claim, you will receive a claim reference number and an electronic receipt
for the claim will be emailed to you.

If you are unable to submit your claim electronically, you can email, fax or mail your completed claim form (“Health, Wellness and Vision Claim
Form”, Pages 2 through 4) and copies of supporting documentation.
