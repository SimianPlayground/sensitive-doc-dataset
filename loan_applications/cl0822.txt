                                     LOAN PROVISIONS

Before submitting a Certified Loan Request, please be certain the member reads and understands
these loan provisions and the IRS Requirements.

 • To be eligible to borrow, the member must be actively contributing to an eligible retirement system
   and have at least three years of contributing membership posted to the account.

 • Members are permitted no more than two loans in a calendar year. If a member applies for a loan
   in December, but it is issued in January, the loan counts toward the two-year maximum in the new
   year.

 • The loan balance cannot be more than 50 percent of the contributions posted to the member’s
   account. The IRS requires that a new loan amount, when added to the highest balance due (with-
   out interest) during the 12-month period for all loans from all employer-provided retirement plans,
   cannot exceed $50,000.

 • Loans are sent via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) to the bank account the member requests.
   Under no circumstances can a member be issued a paper check. Once your loan application is
   submitted, the loan cannot be canceled.

 • Loans must be repaid within five years. Members who have multiple outstanding loans must re-
   pay the balance of all loans taken within a period not to exceed five years from the issuance of
   the first loan. If a loan cannot be repaid within the five-year maximum when paid at the maximum
   allowable loan deduction of 25 percent of the base salary, the loan may be denied or the member
   may be issued a loan in a smaller amount than requested. Members with existing loan balances
   who take a new loan may see the loan deduction increase if the loan cannot be repaid within the
   five-year maximum when paid at the normal minimum deduction. See the form instructions and
   IRS Requirements for additional details.

 • The interest rate is the prevailing rate set annually by the State Treasurer, and is calculated on the
   unpaid balance of the loan. A nonrefundable administrative fee may also be deducted from the
   requested loan amount. For the current interest rate and administrative fee, visit our website at:
   www.nj.gov/treasury/pensions

 • If the member retires with an outstanding loan balance, the member will have the option to pay
   off the outstanding loan balance in its entirety or to repay the loan through deductions from the
   monthly retirement allowance until the balance of the loan plus interest is repaid. The monthly loan
   payment will be calculated to have the loan plus interest satisfied by the member’s five-year end
   date.

 • If the member dies before the outstanding loan balance plus interest has been recovered, the
   remaining balance will be repaid from the proceeds of any other benefit payable to the beneficia-
   ry(ies), including group life insurance, return of contributions, or retirement pension payments.

         INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE CERTIFIED LOAN REQUEST
Use this form only when a member cannot submit a pension loan request using the Member Benefits Online System
(MBOS) because:
    1. The member has been on a leave of absence without pay or transferred employers within the last six months;
    2. The member is paid by State supplemental payroll; or
    3. The employer is late submitting the Quarterly Report of Contributions.
Do not submit this request for any other reason, or it will be returned. All other pension loan requests must be submit-
ted using MBOS. For more information about MBOS visit our website.
PART 1 — MEMBER INFORMATION AND LOAN REQUEST
Complete 1-4, indicating the retirement system of which you are a member, your full name, birth date, and your mem-
bership or Social Security number.
Indicate the loan amount you wish to borrow. Loans must be a minimum of $50 and increase in multiples of $10. The
loan amount may not exceed 50 percent of your total contributions and the loan balance may not exceed $50,000.
If the amount of the loan requested, when added to any existing loan balance, exceeds $50,000, you will be issued
a check for the difference between the loan balance and $50,000, when added to the highest balance due (without
interest) in the prior 12-month period for all loans (see IRS Regulations).
You should request a repayment schedule. Loans have a maximum repayment schedule of five years. You may specify
whether you wish to have the minimum payment, have the loan paid off by a specific date, or pay more than the mini-
mum deduction. If a box is not selected, the loan repayment schedule is set to the minimum payment for no more than
a five-year period. The minimum repayment must be equal to or greater than your monthly or, for State employees,
biweekly base salary multiplied by the current full rate of pension contributions.
Members with large existing loan balances who take a new loan will likely see the loan deduction increase if the loan
cannot be repaid within the five-year maximum when paid at the normal minimum deduction.
You must sign the request. Prior to signing, please be sure to read and understand the Loan Provisions and IRS Re-
quirements included with this request. Incomplete and unsigned requests will not be processed.

PART 2 — EMPLOYER CERTIFICATION
The employer must complete the Certification portion of the request.
Indicate the reason the Certified Loan Request is being submitted. Complete the items for current salary and the ad-
ditional return to payroll and/or transfer information as appropriate.
The employer must sign the Certified Loan Request. Email the completed request to: PensionsLoans@treas.nj.gov

PART 3 — ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER INFORMATION (to be completed by member):
   1. Read the terms and conditions.
   2. Enter your name, mailing address, membership number, Social Security number, and telephone number.
   3. Mark the appropriate payment and account type boxes, and print the financial institution’s account number, rout-
      ing number, and name and address where indicated. Be sure to double check your account and nine-digit routing
      numbers before submission – inaccurate information will cause the application to be rejected.
   4. You and all other parties to this account must sign and date the application.
   5. You must attach a voided check if using a checking account and return the completed form to the NJDPB.

                    IRS REGULATIONS FOR PENSION LOANS

Loan balances must be repaid within five years. Furthermore, the new loan amount, when added to
the highest balance due (without interest) during the prior 12-month period for all loans from all
employer-provided retirement plans, including any other governmental plans sponsored or adminis-
tered by your public sector employer in New Jersey, cannot exceed $50,000.

IRS regulations also require members to make timely payments toward outstanding loan balances,
even if the member is on an approved leave of absence or Workers’ Compensation. Members are
notified after nonpayment (zero contributions) toward the balance of an outstanding loan and offered
the following options:*

      • Pay the loan off through a lump-sum repayment;

      • Repay the loan in monthly installments through personal billing; or

      • Repay through employer payroll deductions if the member returns to employment.

Failure to repay the loan as scheduled may result in the unpaid loan balance being declared a
deemed distribution that is taxable under the rules of Section 72(p) of the Internal Revenue Code.

      • In this event, the NJDPB will report the distribution to the IRS and send you a Form 1099-R
        for tax filing purposes in January of the year following distribution.

      • You will be required to include the portion of the loan representing before-tax contributions as
        income on your federal return.

      • In addition, if you are under age 59 1/2, you will be required to pay an additional 10 percent
        tax for taking an early pension distribution.

A deemed distribution cannot be canceled by resuming loan payments or repaying the loan in full pri-
or to the end of the tax year in which the deemed distribution occurs. Unlike a normal pension distri-
bution, a loan treated as a distribution cannot be rolled over to an IRA or another qualified retirement
plan.

Paying taxes on a defaulted loan balance does not negate the balance; the member is still responsi-
ble for paying the loan balance and any interest that accrues on it within the remaining period left in
the original five-year schedule.

Members who take a loan and subsequently fail to remit loan payments may also be subject to addi-
tional IRS penalties.

Note: Loan payments made in the quarter that the five-year end date occurs will not be posted to the
member’s account until two months after the quarter closes. Therefore, the member will not be able
to take a new loan until all payments are posted after the five-year end date.



*Members must return their payment option selection within 30 days of notification of nonpayment;
failure to respond within the 30 days will result in the unpaid loan balance being declared a taxable
distribution.

                                                                                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS
               Benefit Recipient
               I authorize the NJDPB and the financial institution indicated to directly deposit my pension loan to the account specified. Direct deposit under this
               authorization is full satisfaction and discharge of the amount payable under the retirement system or benefit program. I understand that the provisions of
               the statutes governing the pension funds prohibit the deposit of loan payments to a trust fund. I understand that any loan payment forwarded to the financial
               institution with a due date after my death will be refunded to the appropriate retirement system. I agree that the financial institution shall have the right of
               offset for such a refund. I understand that it is my responsibility to inform the NJDPB of address changes immediately. I authorize the financial institution to
               provide the NJDPB with my home address.

               Other Parties to the Account
               I authorize the NJDPB and the financial institution to directly deposit the benefit recipient’s pension loan to the account specified. This liability is to the
               retirement system or benefit program. If I am entitled to any benefit from the retirement system or benefit program as a beneficiary of the benefit recipient,
               the amount of my liability shall be deducted from the amount payable to me.
