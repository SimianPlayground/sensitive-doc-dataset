I authorize PayFlex to process my payment in the full amount of my claim at the time it is received. I understand my claim
will be processed up to my available balance at the time of submission. I certify that the medical expenses for which I am
seeking reimbursement from the Retiree Medical Account have been incurred by the Account Holder or by an individual who
qualifies as the Account Holder’s spouse or dependent under an OPERS health care plan. I further certify that these
expenses have not been reimbursed, nor shall reimbursement be sought, from any other health plan coverage, including a
Health Savings Account. I also certify that these expenses have not, and will not, be claimed as a tax deduction or credit on
any federal income tax return, or on any state or local tax returns in violation of state or local law. Any person who, knowingly
and with intent to defraud or deceive any insurance company, files a statement of claim containing any materially false,
incomplete or misleading information is guilty of a crime and may be liable for substantial civil penalties.

You can use your Retiree Medical Account to reimburse yourself for eligible expenses. See below for
some common expense types. Be sure to note what documents you’re required to send with each.

•   Premiums, deductibles and copayments incurred under your Medicare plans (Medicare
    Advantage / Medigap) or employer-sponsored or individual health plans. This includes your
    OPERS medical, dental and vision plans.

           Premiums: When you submit a claim, you should include a premium statement AND a bank
           statement or a canceled check showing the amount paid. When submitting a request for your
           premium reimbursement, the coverage period start date should be used as the date of service,
           not the date of payment. You may provide the OPERS Health Care Premium Receipt as proof
           of premium payment for your OPERS medical, dental, and vision plans.

           Deductibles / Copayments: When you submit a claim, you should include an Explanation of
           Benefits (EOB). EOB is the best proof of payment. If you don’t have an EOB, you can send an
           itemized statement or receipt instead, but it must include the following: name of the doctor,
           hospital or facility that provided treatment, name of the patient, date(s) of service, type of
           service and the final cost.

•   Medicare Part B premiums

           The first time you request reimbursement for Medicare Part B Premiums, send us a copy of
           your Notice of Medical Insurance Enrollment and Premium Deduction. It’s from the Department
           of Health and Human Services. Each time thereafter, you only need to complete this form.

•   Other eligible health care expenses. You can find a list of eligible expenses in the Internal
    Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 502 or visit www.payflex.com.

           When requesting reimbursement for an eligible expense, you must submit this form and an
           itemized statement or receipt. It must include the following: name of the doctor, hospital or
           facility that provided treatment, name of the patient, date(s) of service, type of service and the
           final cost.

           Claims for some over-the-counter (OTC) drugs or medicines may require you to send us a
           copy of the prescription with your claim form. You can find the list online at www.payflex.com.

PayFlex has sole discretion to determine if an expense is eligible for reimbursement and the
documentation of a claim is complete. If you have any questions about your claim, you can call
PayFlex at 1-888-672-9136.


PayFlex cannot and shall not provide any payment or service in violation of any United States (US)
economic or trade sanctions.
