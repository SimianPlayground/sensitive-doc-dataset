              NOTICE TO FIRST LIEN MORTGAGE LOAN APPLICANTS: THE RIGHT TO COLLECT YOUR
              MORTGAGE LOAN PAYMENTS MAY BE TRANSFERRED.

              You are applying for a mortgage loan covered by the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)
              (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). RESPA gives you certain rights under Federal law. This statement describes
              whether the servicing for this loan may be transferred to a different loan servicer.

              "Servicing" refers to collecting your principal, interest, and escrow payments, if any, as well as sending
              any monthly or annual statements, tracking account balances, and handling other aspects of your loan.
              You will be given advance notice before a transfer occurs.


                   We may assign, sell or transfer the servicing of your loan while the loan is outstanding.


                   We do not service mortgage loans of the type for which you applied. We intend to assign, sell, or
                   transfer the servicing of your mortgage loan before the first payment is due.


                   The loan for which you have applied will be serviced at this financial institution and we do not intend
                   to sell, transfer, or assign the servicing of the loan.
