Healthcare Expenses for FSA or HRA

1. After completing the Request for Reimbursement Form, attach a copy of your insurance company’s Explanation of
   Benefits (EOB) or bills/account histories for the services you have received. Submitted documentation must include:
   a. the date the service was incurred (not necessarily equal to the date of payment)
   b. a brief description of the service or product
   c. the amount paid for the service
   d. the patient responsibility (the amount you owed to the provider or merchant) for the service or product after the
      insurance has paid (if insurance was billed)

2. If a service has been partially covered by insurance, send a copy of the EOB received from the insurance company.
   Request only the amount you will actually be paying for a service. PacificSource Administrators cannot reimburse you
   for amounts that will be paid by insurance.

3. Third party verification is required; therefore, cancelled checks and/or check copies may not be used as
   documentation.

4. Please retain originals of the bills/forms submitted for your personal tax records. We store documents electronically
   and destroy the originals after processing; therefore, originals will not be returned to you. Incomplete Reimbursement
   Request Forms or those received without proper documentation attached cannot be processed. If this happens, you
   will receive a letter or explanation.

5. In certain instances, statements from your healthcare provider may be necessary to verify the medical necessity of
   the procedure or prescription. Please call if you have questions.

Dependent Care Expenses

6. Please include your dependent’s full name and date of birth on the Request for Reimbursement form.

7. After completing the Request for Reimbursement Form, attach a copy of the bill showing the provider’s name, dates
   of service, and the amount you are responsible for paying. Childcare expenses may be submitted for children up to the
   age of 13.

8. Third party verification is required; therefore, cancelled checks and/or check copies may not be used as
   documentation. If your daycare provider does not provide documentation, they must sign this form each time you
   submit a claim. (Photocopied signatures are not accepted.) In certain instances, statements from your healthcare
   provider may be necessary to verify the medical necessity of adult daycare. Please call if you have questions.

9. Please obtain originals of the bills/forms submitted for your personal tax records. Refer to #4 above for more
   information.

Healthcare Expenses (for those not charged to your benefit debit card)
Per IRS guidelines, please attach appropriate documentation (explained on the reverse). One form may be used for
multiple expenses. Do not send original documentation. If you are enrolled in both health FSA and HRA and would like to
be reimbursed automatically per your plan specifications, check both FSA and HRA. Selecting both is the default.

If you have an expense that you expressly do not want run through both plans, indicate either FSA or HRA. Many HRAs
only allow prescriptions to be paid if they apply toward your deductible. Please send an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) for
each prescription. If you would like the prescription to pay from your FSA because you already know that it is not eligible
for the HRA, select the FSA checkbox.
