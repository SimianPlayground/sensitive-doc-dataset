without obtaining prior written consent of the College. No contract shall be made by Contractor with any other party for furnishing the

competition in the compilation of the bid or offer being submitted herewith; Contractor also certifies that it has not in any manner,

or in part, at its sole discretion.

RIGHT TO STOP WORK If the College determines, either directly or indirectly, that the Contractor’s performance is not within the
specifications, terms or conditions of this RFP and/or that the quality of the job is unacceptable, the College has the right to stop the

the task requested in this document. Any omission of parts, products, processes, etc. in the specifications are the responsibility of
the Contractor and the College will not bear the responsibility of their omission. If omissions in the specifications are discovered and
these omissions will impact the contract price then it is the responsibility of the Contractor to note these omissions, in writing, prior to
accepting the award. If these omissions are not noted prior to award then the Contractor’s silence is deemed as full and complete
acceptance and any additional costs will be borne by the Contractor.

SUBCONTRACTORS Contractors must submit the names and addresses of all subcontractors to be retained for this project. The
College reserves the right to reject. Subcontractors shall conform in all respects to the applicable provisions specified for the prime
contractor and shall be subject to approval by the College. If a subcontractor is determined to be unacceptable by the College, the
firm shall substitute an acceptable subcontractor with no change in any Contract unit prices or overall Contract sum. If a firm fails,
within a timely manner, to propose another subcontractor to whom the College has no objection, the College reserves the right to
reject the proposal. The firm will use only those subcontractors approved by the College. All subcontractors shall comply with
federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to the services covered by the subcontractor and shall include all terms
and conditions set forth herein which apply with equal force to the subcontractor, as if they were the Contractor referred to herein.
The Contractor is responsible for the Contract performance, whether or not subcontractors are used.

materials to be incorporated into the real property on College construction projects.

TERMINATION BASED ON LACK OF FUNDING Any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will be subject to funding and
continued appropriation of sufficient funds for the contract. For purposes of this solicitation, the College’s appropriating authority is
deemed to be the Board of Trustees of CSM. Insufficient funds shall be grounds for immediate termination of the contract.

Contract, performance there under is deemed to be unsatisfactory, the College shall so notify the Contractor in writing, and the
Contractor shall correct such unsatisfactory conditions within fifteen (15) calendar days from the receipt of such notification. If such
corrections are not made within the specified period, the College may terminate the Contract at that time.

TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT If an award results from this RFP, and the Contractor has not performed or has unsatisfactorily
performed the contract, payment shall be withheld at the discretion of the College. Failure on the part of the contractor to fulfill
contractual obligations shall be considered just cause for termination of the contract and the Contractor is not entitled to recover any
costs incurred by the Contractor up to the date of termination.

TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE COLLEGE The performance of the work or services under a contract as a
result of this solicitation may be terminated in whole or in part, whenever the President of CSM shall deem that termination is in the
best interest of the College. Such determination shall be at the sole discretion of the President or her designee. In such event, the
College shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of the contract for work or services performed or
furnished prior to the effective date of termination. The Contractor shall not be reimbursed for anticipatory profits. Termination
hereunder shall become effective by delivery to contractor of written notice of termination upon which date the termination shall
become effective.

other Maryland educational institutions and public agencies in the State of Maryland, including Charles County Government and
Charles County Public Schools. Unless the Contractor takes an exception, the resulting awarded items, terms and conditions will be
available to other State and local public entities. Should a price adjustment be necessary to include any other public entity, the
Contractor must so note on the Contractor Information Form. Purchase requests and funding from other agencies will be the
responsibility of those agencies.

drawing, sample or other description which is furnished to or adopted by the College and that they will be fit and sufficient for the
purpose intended, merchantable, of good material and workmanship, and free from defect. Such warranty shall survive a contract
and shall not be deemed waived either by the College’s acceptance of said materials or goods, in whole or in part, or by payment for
them, in whole or in part. The Contractor further warrants all articles, material and work performed for a period of one year, unless
otherwise stated, from date of acceptance of the items delivered and installed, or work completed. All repairs, replacements or
adjustments during the warranty period shall be at Contractors sole expense.
