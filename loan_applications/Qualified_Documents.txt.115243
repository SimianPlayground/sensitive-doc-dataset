Important Information About Procedures For Applying For A Mortgage

To help the government fight funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires
all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens a
mortgage account.
What this means for you: when you apply for a mortgage, we will ask for your name, address, date of
birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s
license or other identifying documents.
                                                                  8QLIRUP5HVLGHQWLDO/RDQ$SSOLFDWLRQ
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender’s assistance. Applicants should complete this form as “Borrower” or “Co-Borrower,” as applicable. Co-Borrower
information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when  the income or assets of a person other than the Borrower (including the Borrower’s spouse) will be used as a basis for loan
qualification or  the income or assets of the Borrower’s spouse or other person who has community property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her
liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person has community property rights pursuant to applicable law and Borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is
located in a community property state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

If this is an application for joint credit, Borrower and Co-Borrower each agree that we intend to apply for joint credit (sign below):
