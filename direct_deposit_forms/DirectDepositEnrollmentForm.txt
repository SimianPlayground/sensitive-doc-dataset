                            Employee Direct Deposit Enrollment Form
To enroll in Full Service Direct Deposit, simply fill out this form and give to the Accounting Department.
Attach a voided check for each checking account - not a deposit slip. If depositing to a savings account, ask
your bank to give you the Routing/Transit Number for your account. It isn’t always the same as the number on a
savings deposit slip. This will help ensure that you are paid correctly.

Below is a sample check MICR line, detailing where the information necessary to complete this form can be
found.
