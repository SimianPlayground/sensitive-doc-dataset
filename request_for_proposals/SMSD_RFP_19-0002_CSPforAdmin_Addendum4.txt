Addendum No. 4                                                                Page 6 of 15
Number   Question                                                                            Response

         The glass specifications call for Solarban 60 on Clear over Clear. The solar
         heat gain coefficient of 0.22. The glass performance chart states that this
1-1      particular make up would have a heat gain coefficient of 0.39. Is this correct?     Confirmed.
         Division 95100 indicates Type 2 - Tectum ceilings to match existing. Where
1-2      does this occur at?                                                                 Tectum Ceilings do not occur in the Admin Building and shall be deleted from the Spec by Addendum 3.
1-3      How high is the edge trim at the cloud ceilings?                                    Edge trim shall be 6" high (from manufacturer's standard).
         RCP and finish schedule conflict in rooms 100B and 201A. Please clarify ceiling
1-4      type.                                                                               See revised drawings A6.00 and A6.01 with corrected ceiling types in the finish schedule.

         The RCP does not indicate all the ceiling grilles as shown on mechanical
1-5      drawings. Will this be incorporated into future drawings?                           See revised MEP Drawings.
1-6      The IFP-1000 FACP specified has been discontinued. Replacement?                     Provide IFP-4000ES refer to updated specifications in addendum 3.
1-7      Is the AHJ for this project going to require Voice Evacuation?                      Response forthcoming in Addendum 4, to be issued on 3-22-2019.

         Are the directories part of the signage scope? They are based on design by
         APCO, a company I use for room signs. If so, how many are there? Seems like
         two-letterboards and the usual glass case. There are only 3 room #s
         designated for the directory-114, 206 & 209. Does that mean the directory
         only has those 3 or does that mean that they are the ones who get
         letterboards ? 10 13 00-5 3.3 says “install directories in locations and    Directories are part of the scope. One directory is indicated in the Lobby. Verbiage on Directory is TBD. See revised drawings A6.00 and
1-8      mounting hts indicated on drawings.” Don’t see them in drawings.            A6.02

         Specs 10 14 00-3 E mentions die cut vinyl. A0.13 has a star and No 1 with
         braille beneath on figure 407, then 2 and C with brailles on separate signs.
         Because of the braille, the numbers and letters have to sit on a substrate like
         metal or acrylic. Mainly I need to know how many needed, sizing, substrate

         vinyl mention? Are these symbols going to be provided by the elevator mfg?
         The 10 14 00 summary #4 says part of scope is vinyl cut signs-don’t see it any

       certifications. To my knowledge these certifications are different from SBE.       • Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County (METRO) SBE Certification;
       Specifically for this project, will MBE & WBE certifications be acceptable as      • City of Houston SBE Certification; • Fort Bend Independent School District SBE Certification; or

       Exhibit N also refers me to “see SMSD Board Policy CV (Local)”. I have
       searched the internet and the school’s website and cannot find this. Can this

       Exhibit N, page 49 of 60, on the bottom/bolded section states, “I, the
       authorized representative for the company named below, certify that the
       information concerning residency certification, and MWBE and HUB
       certification have been reviewed by me and the information furnished is true
       to the best of my knowledge.” Can you please provide further explanation as
       to what residency certification is? DTC follows under the state residency
       requirements, but does this statement apply to state or specifically Stafford,
1-18   TX?                                                                                The residency certification is certifying that the Contractor’s address listed on Exhibit N is the place of residence.
       If the above refers to Stafford resident and not state, and DTC is not a
1-19   “Stafford resident” will this have a negative effect on our grading?               SMSD will use the selection criteria and weighting detailed in the RFP, including page 2 of the RFP.

       The last Stafford Project (Middle School) had an emergency radio

       The Geo-Tech Report does not recommend the use void forms under the

       In regards to the attached page 52 of 60 – CONTRACTOR AND
       SUBCONTRACTOR PARTICIPATION FORM, is it correct that we need to have a
       separate line for every work category required in this bid (i.e. masonry, steel
       fabrication, steel erection, rough carpentry, etc.) and list the name, address,
       telephone number, contact person, scope of work, Small Business status,
       dollar amount, and percentage of the bid for all subcontractors and suppliers
2-42   all by 4:00 on bid day? This is likely to be around 40 companies?               All portions of the front-end of the spec shall remain in force with no changes.

       Putting together a Small Business Participation Plan requires an enormous
       amount of communication, bid qualifications, and information gathering with
       subcontractors who may not even be accessible in the 5 hour window
       between 11:00 and 4:00. Why can’t the due date / time for the Small
       Business Participation Plan be moved to the day after the bid day at 4:00?
2-43   The rest of part 2 can still be turned in on bid day at 4:00.               Due date and time for bids shall remain unchanged.

       Paragraph 1.7.B.1 of spec section 051200 calls for A QUALIFIED FABRICATION
       WHO PARTICIPATES IN THE AISC QUALITY CERTIFICATION PROGRAM AND IS
       DESIGNATED AN AISC-CERTIFED PLANT, CATEGORY SBD. This required greatly
       reduces the number of steel fabricators in the Houston area that can bid. This
       typically raises the cost of the structural steel fabrication. Less than 10% of
       the projects of this type require AISC Certification. Can this requirement be
2-44   waived?                                                                            See response to question 2-33 above.
