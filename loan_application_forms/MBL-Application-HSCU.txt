IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify
and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask you
for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your drivers license or other
identifying documents.
