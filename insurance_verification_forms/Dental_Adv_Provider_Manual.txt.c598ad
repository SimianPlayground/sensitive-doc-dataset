provides members with an in-network discount of 20

Advantage Discount Dental Plan, you can log in to the
UPMC Dental Advantage provider portal or call the Dental

members may enroll in the Discount Dental Plan even if
they have group dental coverage through another carrier
as long as their employer purchases the UPMC Dental
Advantage Discount Dental Plan. However, the UPMC
Dental Advantage discount would be considered secondary
to their dental plan. The UPMC Dental Advantage Discount
Dental Plan may not be used in conjunction with other
UPMC Dental Advantage plans unless otherwise indicated
on the plan document. Please refer to the plan documents
available through the UPMC Dental Advantage

Scenario 3 – New pediatric dental EHB eligible member in
orthodontic treatment not previously covered by UPMC
Dental Advantage
UPMC Dental Advantage will require dentists to submit a
Salzmann Scale Index for new pediatric dental EHB members in
treatment who were not previously covered by UPMC Dental
Advantage. Payments for these members will be based on
the EHB plan design, including satisfying the shared medical/
orthodontia deductible and remaining months of treatment.
Example:
Member started treatment July 15, 2013, on a non-UPMC Health
Plan dental plan. The member is enrolled in a pediatric dental
EHB plan on February 1, 2014, and has eight months of treatment
remaining and a balance of $750. The member has been approved to
continue treatment. The plan that the member is enrolled in has a $0
shared medical/orthodontia deductible.
Summary of payments:
Remaining Balance of
Orthodontia Treatment                                     $750
Medical/Ortho Deductible                                     $0
Pediatric Dental EHB Benefit                              50%
Plan Payment (50% of remaining balance)                   $375
                        (paid quarterly throughout the course of
                            treatment or when coverage ceases)
Member Responsibility
(50% of remaining balance)                                $375
Months of Remaining Treatment                                  8
Quarterly Payments                                     $140.63
                        (Final quarterly payment in this scenario
                           would be $93.74. Payments would be
                            made through three quarters, as long
                                as the member remains eligible.)

                                               ORTHODONTIC  for EHB Members

                                      SALZMANN EVALUATION INDEX INSTRUCTIONS

                   Instructions for using the “Handicapping Malocclusion Assessment Record”
	  
	  

       This assessment record is intended to disclose whether a handicapping malocclusion is present and to assess
       its severity according to the criteria and weights (points values) assigned to them.

       The weights are based on tested clinical orthodontic values from the standpoint of the effect of the malocclusion
       on dental health, function, and esthetics.

       Assessments can be made from casts or directly in the mouth.

       The patient must score 25 or higher on the Salzmann Evaluation Index to be eligible for comprehensive
       orthodontic treatment. However, proposed treatments that have conditions that appear medically beneficial but
       do not result in the necessary 25-point Salzmann qualifier for treatment will also be considered; however, an
       adequate narrative must be submitted to the UPMC Dental Advantage staff orthodontist.
	  
       Examples of conditions that are not described by the Salzmann Index but may be considered medically
       necessary are:

          1.)   Early (phase I) treatments

          2.) Cases that can benefit by starting treatment with some primary teeth present and/or before all the
              permanent teeth are erupted. These would be treatments that, if delayed until all the permanent
              teeth fully erupt, could reasonably risk additional complications such as possible unnecessary
              teeth extractions or jaw surgery in the future.

          3.) Cases that involve impacted teeth

          4.) Cases involving orthognathic surgery

          5.) Cleft palate cases

       An additional assessment record form is provided to describe the patient’s overall condition, the intended
       diagnostic procedures, the treatment plan, and additional comments that may be relevant.

       Also, treatments that require only minor tooth movements (such as molar uprighting) and removable appliance
       therapy that would be considered medically necessary can be submitted. Other orthodontic services that are not
       “typical” will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine if medically necessary. Such cases will require
       narratives, study models, and panoramic and cephalometric radiographs to be sent to UPMC Dental Advantage
       for consideration.

       Cosmetic (ceramic) appliances, broken and lost appliances will be the responsibility of the patient.

       UPMC Dental Advantage recommends verifying the patient’s eligibility for service upon meeting malocclusion
       assessment. Providers may also submit a pre-determination to UPMC Dental Advantage to receive an estimate of
       the plan’s payment.

        Completing the Handicapping Malocclusion Assessment Record
 	  
           A.   INTRA-ARCH DEVIATIONS

                Study casts can be evaluated or the assessment can be made directly in the mouth. The number of teeth
                affected is entered as indicated in the Handicapping Malocclusion Assessment Record. Note that canines
                are considered part of the posterior segment in the Salzmann Index.

                1.   Anterior segment: A value of two (2) points is scored for each tooth affected in the maxilla and one
                     (1) point in the mandible.

                     a.   Missing teeth are assessed by actual count. A tooth with only the roots remaining is scored as
                          missing.

                     b.   Crowded refers to tooth irregularities that interrupt the continuity of the dental arch when the
                          space is insufficient for alignment, without moving other teeth in the arch. Crowded teeth may
                          or may not also be rotated. A tooth scored as crowded is not also scored as rotated.

                     c.   Rotated refers to tooth irregularities that interrupt the continuity of the dental arch when
                          there is sufficient space for alignment. A tooth scored as rotated is not also scored as
                          crowded or spaced.

                     d.   Spacing

                          i.    Open spacing — one or both interproximal tooth surfaces are visible between the anterior
                                teeth. Score the number of teeth affected, not the spaces.

                          ii.   Closed spacing — space is not sufficient to permit eruption of a tooth, or a tooth that is
                                partially erupted, without moving teeth in the same arch. Score the number of teeth
                                affected. Example: if an incisor is blocked from the arch and all the other incisors have
                                sufficient space, though it may be rotated, score one (1) point.

                2.   Posterior segment: A value of one (1) point is scored for each tooth affected.

                     a.   Missing teeth are assessed by actual count. A tooth with only the roots remaining is scored as
                          missing.

                     b.   Crowded refers to tooth irregularities that interrupt the continuity of the dental arch when the
                          space is insufficient for alignment. Crowded teeth may or may not also be rotated. A tooth
                          scored as crowded is not also scored as rotated.

                     c.   Rotated refers to tooth irregularities that interrupt the continuity of the dental arch and all or part
                          of the lingual or buccal surface that faces some part or all of the adjacent proximal tooth
                          surfaces. There is sufficient space for alignment. A tooth scored as rotated is not also scored as
                          crowded.

                     d.   Spacing

                          i.    Open spacing — one or both interproximal tooth surfaces are visible between the posterior
                                teeth. Score the number of teeth affected, not the spaces.

                          ii.   Closed spacing — space is not sufficient to permit eruption of a tooth, or a tooth that is
                                partially erupted, without moving teeth in the same arch. Score the number of teeth
                                affected. Example: If a premolar is blocked from the arch and all the other posterior teeth
                                have sufficient space, though it may be rotated, score one (1) point.

       B.   INTER-ARCH DEVIATIONS

            The dentition is evaluated in centric occlusion.

            1.   Anterior segment: A value of two (2) points is scored for each affected maxillary tooth only
                 (except for overbite see below).

                 a.   Overjet: Score the number of maxillary teeth affected only. Score the points when the maxillary
                      incisors extend beyond the lower incisors in a horizontal direction.

                 b.   Overbite: Score the number of the maxillary or mandibular incisors affected. Score the points
                      when the maxillary incisors vertically overlap the mandibular incisors in an excessive amount.

                 c.   Crossbite: Score the points when the maxillary incisors occlude lingual to the mandibular incisors.

                 d.   Open bite refers to vertical inter-arch dental separation between the upper and lower incisors
                      when the posterior teeth are in centric occlusion. Open bite is scored in addition to overjet if the
                      maxillary incisor teeth are above the incisal edges of the mandibular incisors when the posterior
                      teeth are in centric occlusion. Edge-to-edge occlusion is not assessed as open bite.

            2.   Posterior segment: A value of one (1) point is scored for each affected maxillary tooth. (Note that the
                 canines are considered part of the posterior segment along with the premolars and first molars.)

                          A.   Crossbite: Score the points when the buccal cusps of the mandibular posterior teeth
                               are edge-to-edge or buccal to the buccal cusps of the opposing occlusion or when the
                               buccal cusps of the lower posterior teeth are edge-to-edge or lingual to the lingual
                               cusps of the opposing occlusion.

                          B.   Open bite refers to the vertical interdental separation between the upper and lower
                               posterior teeth when the dentition is observed in centric occlusion. Cusp-to-cusp
                               occlusion is not assessed as open bite.

                          C.   Anteroposterior deviation refers to the occlusion forward or rearward of the accepted
                               normal (Class I) of the mandibular canine, first and second premolar and first molar in
                               relation to the opposing maxillary teeth. The deviation is scored when the maxillary
                               first molar extends one-half cusp or more, mesially or distally, as compared to a
                               normal (Class I) occlusion. Also, a deviation is scored if the premolars or canines
                               occlude mesially or distally to the accepted normal (Class I) positions. (Note: The
                               Salzmann Index asks how the mandibular posterior teeth relate to the maxillary
                               posterior teeth.)


       C.   DENTOFACIAL DEVIATIONS

            The following deviations are scored as handicapping when associated with a malocclusion:
            Score eight (8) points for each deviation.

            1.   Cleft palate or cleft lip

            2.   Lower lip positioned completely palatal to the maxillary incisor teeth

            3.   Functional jaw limitations such as a functional shift of the mandible

            4.   Facial asymmetry to the extent that surgical intervention is necessary

            5.   Speech impairment that is related to the malocclusion and is documented by a licensed or certified
                 therapist

Committee from the Plan, including a written statement
giving the basis of the decision.


Surveys and Assessments
The Plan conducts a series of surveys and assessments
of members and dentists in a continuous effort
to improve performance. All dentists are urged to
participate when asked.


Member Administration
Member and Dentist Satisfaction Surveys
The Plan conducts annual surveys on both member and
dentist satisfaction. Participation by members and dentists
enables the Plan to develop quality improvement plans.
The surveys assess:
   • Access to care and/or services.
   • Overall satisfaction with the Plan.
   • Provider availability.
   • Quality of care received.
   • Responsiveness to administrative processes.
   • Responsiveness to inquiries.


Quality Improvement Program
The goal of the Quality Improvement Program is to
continually examine UPMC Dental Advantage Medicare’s
clinical and administrative operations in an effort to
continuously improve the Plan’s ability to deliver high-
quality, timely, safe, and cost-effective care and services.
The Quality Improvement Program operates in accordance
with the guidelines established by the National Committee
for Quality Assurance (NCQA), the Pennsylvania Department
of Health, and the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.
The program critically assesses the Plan’s performance
regarding customer service, dentist satisfaction,
credentialing, pharmacy, preventive services, utilization of
resources, and various health care initiatives.
The physicians who serve on the QIC are at the center of
the program. This committee, made up of both academic
and community doctors, operates directly under the
auspices of the board of directors. The QIC is vital to
the Plan because it develops and evaluates clinical and
operational standards for dentists.
