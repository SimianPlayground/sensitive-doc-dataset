Authorization

              1.    I authorize Mt. San Antonio College to direct deposit funds to my account in the financial institution as indicated in Step 3 below. If funds to which I am not entitled
                    are deposited in my account, I authorize the College to initiate a correcting (debit) entry. I understand that the authorization may be rejected or discontinued by the
                    College at any time. If any of the above information changes, I will promptly complete a new authorization agreement. If the direct deposit is not stopped before
                    closing an account, funds payable to me will be returned to the College for distribution. This will delay my payment.
              2.    This authorization remains in effect until the College receives written notification of change or cancellation from you or your financial institution.
              3.    The College reserves the right to recall or adjust any deposits improperly created and deposited to my account.
              4.    I will hold the College harmless for any liability to pay charges for insufficient fund transactions that result from failure within the Automated Clearing House
                    network to correctly and timely deposit monies into my account.

Disclosure Statement

The first time a Payroll payment is processed it must go through a “pre-note” or “test run” to our bank. Therefore, your first payment after requesting direct deposit will be a
check. The pre-note allows our bank the opportunity to notify us if there is a problem with the banking information that we entered. The pre-note period must occur with
Accounts Payable/Student Accounts checks as well. If the pre-note does not occur on the Accounts Payable system before the processing of a check, then the first payment
processed from Accounts Payable may be a check as well with all subsequent payments being directly deposited.

As the account holder, I authorize, by signing below, credits to be made to my bank account listed here

Step 3

You must verify that your bank is a member of an Automated Clearing House (ACH). Failure to do so could delay the processing of your payment. You must attach a voided
check or have your bank complete the bank information and the account holder must sign below.
