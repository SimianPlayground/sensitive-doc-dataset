                           STATEMENTS REQUIRED BY LAW AND EXECUTIVE ORDER
SBA is required to withhold or limit financial assistance, to impose special conditions on approved loans, to provide
special notices to applicants or borrowers and to require special reports and data from borrowers in order to comply with
legislation passed by the Congress and Executive Orders issued by the President and by the provisions of various inter-
agency agreements. SBA has issued regulations and procedures that implement these laws and executive orders. These are
contained in Parts 112, 113, and 117 of Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations and in Standard Operating
Procedures.
Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a)
Any person can request to see or get copies of any personal information that SBA has in his or her file when that file is
retrieved by individual identifiers such as name or social security numbers. Requests for information about another party
may be denied unless SBA has the written permission of the individual to release the information to the requestor or
unless the information is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.
Under the provisions of the Privacy Act, you are not required to provide your social security number. Failure to provide
your social security number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to which you are entitled. Disclosures of name
and other personal identifiers are, however, required for a benefit, as SBA requires an individual seeking assistance from
SBA to provide it with sufficient information for it to make a character determination. In determining whether an
individual is of good character, SBA considers the person’s integrity, candor, and disposition toward criminal actions.
Additionally, SBA is specifically authorized to verify your criminal history, or lack thereof, pursuant to section
7(a)(1)(B), 15 USC Section 636(a)(1)(B) of the Small Business Act ( the Act). Further, for all forms of assistance, SBA is
authorized to make all investigations necessary to ensure that a person has not engaged in acts that violate or will violate
the Act or the Small Business Investment Act, 15 USC Sections 634(b)(11) and 687(b)(a), respectively. For these
purposes, you are asked to voluntarily provide your social security number to assist SBA in making a character
determination and to distinguish you from other individuals with the same or similar name or other personal identifier.
The Privacy Act authorizes SBA to make certain “routine uses” of information protected by that Act. One such routine
use is the disclosure of information maintained in SBA’s investigative files system of records when this information
indicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil, criminal, or administrative in nature. Specifically, SBA
may refer the information to the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local or foreign, charged with responsibility
for, or otherwise involved in investigation, prosecution, enforcement or prevention of such violations. Another routine use
is disclosure to other Federal agencies conducting background checks; only to the extent the information is relevant to the
requesting agencies' function. See, 74 F.R. 14890 (2009), and as amended from time to time for additional background
and other routine uses.
Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3401) -- This is notice to you as required by the Right to Financial
Privacy Act of 1978, of SBA's access rights to financial records held by financial institutions that are or have been doing
business with you or your business, including any financial institutions participating in a loan or loan guaranty. The law
provides that SBA shall have a right of access to your financial records in connection with its consideration or
administration of assistance to you in the form of a Government guaranteed loan. SBA is required to provide a certificate
of its compliance with the Act to a financial institution in connection with its first request for access to your financial
records, after which no further certification is required for subsequent accesses. The law also provides that SBA's access
rights continue for the term of any approved loan guaranty agreement. No further notice to you of SBA's access rights is
required during the term of any such agreement. The law also authorizes SBA to transfer to another Government authority
any financial records included in a application for a loan, or concerning an approved loan or loan guarantee, as necessary
to process, service or foreclose on a loan guaranty or collect on a defaulted loan guaranty.
Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552)
This law provides, with some exceptions, that SBA must supply information reflected in agency files and records to a
person requesting it. Information about approved loans that will be automatically released includes, among other things,
statistics on our loan programs (individual borrowers are not identified in the statistics) and other information such as the
names of the borrowers (and their officers, directors, stockholders or partners), the collateral pledged to secure the loan,
the amount of the loan, its purpose in general terms and the maturity. Proprietary data on a borrower would not routinely
be made available to third parties. All requests under this Act are to be addressed to the nearest SBA office and be
identified as a Freedom of Information request.
Flood Disaster Protection Act (42 U.S.C. 4011) -- Regulations have been issued by the Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA) and by SBA implementing this Act and its amendments. These regulations prohibit SBA from
making certain loans in an FIA designated floodplain unless Federal Flood insurance is purchased as a condition of the
loan. Failure to maintain the required level of flood insurance makes the applicant ineligible for any financial assistance
from SBA, including disaster assistance.

Executive Orders -- Floodplain Management and Wetland Protection (42 F.R. 26951 and 42 F.R. 26961) – SBA
discourages settlement in or development of a floodplain or a wetland. This statement is to notify all SBA loan applicants
that such actions are hazardous to both life and property and should be avoided. The additional cost of flood preventive
construction must be considered in addition to the possible loss of all assets and investments due to a future flood.
Occupational Safety and Health Act (15 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) -- This legislation authorizes the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration in the Department of Labor to require businesses to modify facilities and procedures to protect
employees or pay penalty fees. Businesses can be forced to cease operations or be prevented from starting operations in a
new facility. Therefore, SBA may require additional information from an applicant to determine whether the business will
be in compliance with OSHA regulations and allowed to operate its facility after the loan is approved and disbursed.
Signing this form as an applicant is certification that the OSHA requirements that apply to the applicant business have
been determined and that the applicant, to the best of its knowledge, is in compliance. Furthermore, applicant certifies that
it will remain in compliance during the life of the loan.
Civil Rights Legislation -- All businesses receiving SBA financial assistance must agree not to discriminate in any
business practice, including employment practices and services to the public on the basis of categories cited in 13 C.F.R.,
Parts 112, 113, and 117 of SBA Regulations. This includes making their goods and services available to handicapped
clients or customers. All business borrowers will be required to display the "Equal Employment Opportunity Poster"
prescribed by SBA.
Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691) -- The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from
discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or age
(provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicant's income
derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the
Consumer Credit Protection Act.
Executive Order 11738 -- Environmental Protection (38 F.R. 251621) -- The Executive Order charges SBA with
administering its loan programs in a manner that will result in effective enforcement of the Clean Air Act, the Federal
Water Pollution Act and other environment protection legislation.
Debt Collection Act of 1982, Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq. and other titles) -- These laws
require SBA to collect aggressively any loan payments which become delinquent. SBA must obtain your taxpayer
identification number when you apply for a loan. If you receive a loan, and do not make payments as they come due, SBA
may take one or more of the following actions: (1) report the status of your loan(s) to credit bureaus, (2) hire a collection
agency to collect your loan, (3) offset your income tax refund or other amounts due to you from the Federal Government,
(4) suspend or debar you or your company from doing business with the Federal Government, (5) refer your loan to the
Department of Justice or other attorneys for litigation, or (6) foreclose on collateral or take other action permitted in the
loan instruments.
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-603) -- If you are an alien who was in this country illegally
since before January 1, 1982, you may have been granted lawful temporary resident status by the United States
Immigration and Naturalization Service pursuant to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. For five years from
the date you are granted such status, you are not eligible for financial assistance from the SBA in the form of a loan
guaranty under Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act unless you are disabled or a Cuban or Haitian entrant. When you
sign this document, you are making the certification that the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 does not apply
to you, or if it does apply, more than five years have elapsed since you have been granted lawful temporary resident status
pursuant to such 1986 legislation.
Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821 et seq.)
Borrowers using SBA funds for the construction or rehabilitation of a residential structure are prohibited from using lead-
based paint (as defined in SBA regulations) on all interior surfaces, whether accessible or not, and exterior surfaces, such

                                         NOTICES REQUIRED BY LAW

The following is a brief summary of the laws applicable to this solicitation of information.

Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35)

SBA is collecting the information on this form to make a character and credit eligibility decision to fund or deny you
a loan or other form of assistance. The information is required in order for SBA to have sufficient information to
determine whether to provide you with the requested assistance. The information collected may be checked
against criminal history indices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a)

Any person can request to see or get copies of any personal information that SBA has in his or her file, when that
file is retrieved by individual identifiers, such as name or social security numbers. Requests for information about
another party may be denied unless SBA has the written permission of the individual to release the information to
the requestor or unless the information is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

Under the provisions of the Privacy Act, you are not required to provide your social security number. Failure to
provide your social security number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to which you are entitled.
Disclosures of name and other personal identifiers are, however, required for a benefit, as SBA requires an
individual seeking assistance from SBA to provide it with sufficient information for it to make a character
determination. In determining whether an individual is of good character, SBA considers the person's integrity,
candor, and disposition toward criminal actions. In making loans pursuant to section 7(a)(6) the Small Business
Act (the Act), 15 USC § 636 (a)(6), SBA is required to have reasonable assurance that the loan is of sound value
and will be repaid or that it is in the best interest of the Government to grant the assistance requested.
Additionally, SBA is specifically authorized to verify your criminal history, or lack thereof, pursuant to section
7(a)(1)(B), 15 USC § 636(a)(1)(B). Further, for all forms of assistance, SBA is authorized to make all
investigations necessary to ensure that a person has not engaged in acts that violate or will violate the Act or the
Small Business Investment Act,15 USC §§ 634(b)(11) and 687b(a). For these purposes, you are asked to
voluntarily provide your social security number to assist SBA in making a character determination and to
distinguish you from other individuals with the same or similar name or other personal identifier.

When the information collected on this form indicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil,
criminal, or administrative in nature, SBA may refer it to the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local, or
foreign, charged with responsibility for or otherwise involved in investigation, prosecution, enforcement or
 prevention of such violations. See 74 Fed. Reg. 14890 (2009) for other published routine uses.

Tip. Use Form 4506-T to order a transcript or other return information free of charge. See the product list below. You can quickly request transcripts by using
our automated self-help service tools. Please visit us at IRS.gov and click on “Get a Tax Transcript...” under “Tools” or call 1-800-908-9946. If you need a copy
of your return, use Form 4506, Request for Copy of Tax Return. There is a fee to get a copy of your return.

     and telephone number. MIDWEST REGIONAL BANK                                                  #300034 ID: seemasingh

Caution: If the tax transcript is being mailed to a third party, ensure that you have filled in lines 6 through 9 before signing. Sign and date the form once
you have filled in these lines. Completing these steps helps to protect your privacy. Once the IRS discloses your tax transcript to the third party listed

transcript information, you can specify this limitation in your written agreement with the third party.

   6     Transcript requested. Enter the tax form number here (1040, 1065, 1120, etc.) and check the appropriate box below. Enter only one tax form
         number per request. ▶
    a    Return Transcript, which includes most of the line items of a tax return as filed with the IRS. A tax return transcript does not reflect
         changes made to the account after the return is processed. Transcripts are only available for the following returns: Form 1040 series,
         Form 1065, Form 1120, Form 1120-A, Form 1120-H, Form 1120-L, and Form 1120S. Return transcripts are available for the current year
         and returns processed during the prior 3 processing years. Most requests will be processed within 10 business days . . . . . .
    b    Account Transcript, which contains information on the financial status of the account, such as payments made on the account, penalty
         assessments, and adjustments made by you or the IRS after the return was filed. Return information is limited to items such as tax liability
         and estimated tax payments. Account transcripts are available for most returns. Most requests will be processed within 10 business days .
    c    Record of Account, which provides the most detailed information as it is a combination of the Return Transcript and the Account
         Transcript. Available for current year and 3 prior tax years. Most requests will be processed within 10 business days . . . . . .
   7    Verification of Nonfiling, which is proof from the IRS that you did not file a return for the year. Current year requests are only available
        after June 15th. There are no availability restrictions on prior year requests. Most requests will be processed within 10 business days . .
   8    Form W-2, Form 1099 series, Form 1098 series, or Form 5498 series transcript. The IRS can provide a transcript that includes data from
        these information returns. State or local information is not included with the Form W-2 information. The IRS may be able to provide this
        transcript information for up to 10 years. Information for the current year is generally not available until the year after it is filed with the IRS. For
        example, W-2 information for 2011, filed in 2012, will likely not be available from the IRS until 2013. If you need W-2 information for retirement
        purposes, you should contact the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213. Most requests will be processed within 10 business days .
Caution: If you need a copy of Form W-2 or Form 1099, you should first contact the payer. To get a copy of the Form W-2 or Form 1099 filed
with your return, you must use Form 4506 and request a copy of your return, which includes all attachments.
   9     Year or period requested. Enter the ending date of the year or period, using the mm/dd/yyyy format. If you are requesting more than four
         years or periods, you must attach another Form 4506-T. For requests relating to quarterly tax returns, such as Form 941, you must enter
         each quarter or tax period separately.
                                                                      /         /                  /        /                    /       /                    /        /
