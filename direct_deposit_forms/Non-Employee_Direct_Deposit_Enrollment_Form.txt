         DIRECT DEPOSIT ENROLLMENT INSTRUCTIONS
Dear FINRA Neutral:

You may authorize FINRA to deposit your honoraria and expense reimbursements
directly into your personal checking account. Direct deposit is not available for a
personal savings account; a business or corporate account; or to the account of your
firm or employer.

By authorizing FINRA to deposit funds into your personal checking account, you must
also authorize FINRA to debit your personal checking account in the event FINRA
erroneously deposits funds into your account. The amount debited will not exceed the
original amount of the erroneous credit.

To take advantage of this benefit, return the Non-Employee Direct Deposit
Enrollment Form below with the following:

      personal checking account number;
      financial institution routing or transit ABA number; and
      a void check for the selected account and financial institution.




Thank you for your interest in serving FINRA and the investing public.

Sincerely,
FINRA Office of Dispute Resolution
                NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECT DEPOSIT ENROLLMENT FORM
Please read and sign below:

I hereby authorize FINRA to deposit funds to the personal checking account at the designated financial institution indicated on
this form below. I further authorize FINRA to debit my personal checking account at the financial institution listed below in the
event that FINRA deposits funds erroneously into my account, for an amount not to exceed the original amount of the erroneous
credit.

Please note: direct deposit is available for personal checking accounts only and cannot be used for savings accounts
or business or corporate accounts. Deposits cannot be split among multiple accounts.
