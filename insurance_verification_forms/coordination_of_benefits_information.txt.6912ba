Coordination of benefits


If you are covered by more than one medical, vision, pharmacy or dental health plan, Moda Health and Delta Dental coordinate benefits
with other insurers to help you receive the full benefit of those plans. By coordinating benefits, we may be able to reduce your out-of-
pocket expenses for covered services.

We request information about other insurance upon your initial enrollment and on an annual basis for verification of any changes that
may have happened during the year. In order to prevent your claim from being delayed or denied, please take a moment to complete this
form and return it to us within 10 days. To avoid delays, please fill out and return the form even if you do not have other coverage.

Please let us know if you or any family members have any other medical, vision, pharmacy or dental coverage now (including Medicare
and Medicaid) or if one has existed in the last 12 months. Please attach a separate sheet for any additional plan information.

Do you or any family members have any other medical, vision, pharmacy or dental health coverage now (including Medicare and
Medicaid)? Has other health coverage existed in the last 12 months? If multiple health coverage exists, or has been in place in the last 12
months, attach a separate sheet for any additional plan information.

Please type or print legibly in ink, completing all information requested and sign in Section 8. Thank you!
