1.1   Introduction and background

      The University of Wisconsin (UW) System is seeking a Digital Learning Environment to
      succeed its current Learning Management System. A Digital Learning Environment in this
      context is considered to be the digital “hub” for a confederation of services and tools that
      support teaching and learning, versus simply an administrative tool for managing course
      content.

      Since its creation, the University of Wisconsin System has established itself as one of the
      world’s premier public university systems. Each year the University of Wisconsin educates
      approximately 180,000 students on 26 campuses, and serves more than one million citizens
      through statewide extension programs.

      UW System’s campuses in Madison and Milwaukee offer both undergraduate and graduate
      degree programs, including doctoral and professional programs. Eleven comprehensive
      campuses provide students both undergraduate and master’s degree programs in smaller,
      more individualized academic settings. The 13 UW Colleges deliver freshman-sophomore
      courses for students seeking a foundation for a bachelor’s degree.

      UW-Extension works with all 26 UW campuses, all 72 Wisconsin counties, and a wide
      variety of other educational partners to bring UW expertise to all corners of the state. It
      also is the home of UW’s Flexible Option degree programs, which award credit based on
      demonstrated competency, not class time.

      All UW System campuses and UW-Extension programs provide Wisconsin’s citizens with
      opportunities to contribute to the state’s growing “knowledge economy” through the
      University of Wisconsin’s three-pronged mission of teaching, research and public service.

      The purpose of this document is to provide interested parties with information to enable
      them to prepare and submit proposals for a comprehensive enterprise Digital Learning
      Environment, including assistance with implementation and integration with other existing
      systems and software. UW intends to use the results of this RFP to award a contract for
      these products and services.


1.2   Scope of the project

      The results of this RFP will be used by a central administrative unit and all campuses of
      the University of Wisconsin System except UW-Madison.

1.3   Procuring and contracting agency

2.0   PREPARING AND SUBMITTING A PROPOSAL

      2.1   General instructions

            The evaluation and selection of a contractor and the contract will be based on the
            information submitted in the vendor's proposal plus references, any required hands-on
            assessments (“sandbox”) and any required on-site visits or oral interviews. Failure to
            respond to each of the requirements in the RFP may be the basis for rejecting a response.

            Elaborate proposals (e.g., expensive artwork), beyond that sufficient to present a
            complete and effective proposal, are not necessary or desired.

      2.2   Incurring costs

            The University of Wisconsin is not liable for any cost incurred by proposers in replying
            to this RFP.

      2.3   Submitting the proposal

            Proposers must submit one (1) electronic copy on a CD or DVD, plus an original and
            thirteen (13) hard copies of all materials required for acceptance of their proposal by
            February 28, 2017 2:00 PM CST to:

             Office of Procurement
             780 Regent Street, Suite 105
             Madison, WI 53715

      Proposals must be received in the above office by the specified time stated above. All
      proposals must be time-stamped as accepted by the Office of Procurement by the stated
      time. Proposals not so stamped will not be accepted. Receipt of a proposal by the
      University mail system does not constitute receipt of a proposal by the Office of
      Procurement, for purposes of this RFP.

      To ensure confidentiality of the document, all proposals must be packaged, sealed and
      show the following information on the outside of the package:

             —Proposer's name and address
             —Request for proposal title
             —Request for proposal number
             —Proposal due date

      An electronic copy on a CD or DVD plus an original and three (3) hard copies of the
      Cost Proposal must be sealed and submitted as a separate part of the proposal. The
      outside of the envelope must be clearly labeled with the words “Cost Proposal, RFP
      (Name of RFP)” and name of the vendor and due date. The cost proposal is due to the
      addressee on the due date and time noted above.


2.4   Special notes regarding this RFP

         1. Proposers will be required to submit a DVD containing short videos
            demonstrating various aspects of their proposed solution. The University’s intent
            is to locate these materials on a secure server for approximately four (4) weeks,
            accessible by secure login to UW evaluators, subject matter experts, and
            procurement personnel directly involved in evaluating the proposal. Any licenses,
            waivers, nondisclosure agreements, or other releases that proposers may require in
            order for the University to use these materials as described must be included with
            the proposal at no cost to the University. Proposers may not substitute materials
            located at their own URLs or otherwise accessible via the Internet for this
            requirement. Proposers unable to create or submit videos may substitute other
            written or illustrated documents, but should be aware that these alternate materials
            will be scored less favorably than the requested videos.
         2. Finalists will be required to make a “sandbox” environment available to a sizeable
            number of designated hands-on usability testers from all campuses of the
            University of Wisconsin for approximately three to four (3-4) weeks. This may
            include faculty, staff, administrators, course designers, data analysts, individuals
            with disabilities, librarians, technology professionals, and students. Their
            structured feedback will comprise the Usability score for this RFP. Access to the
            “sandbox” as well as any licenses, waivers, nondisclosure agreements, or other
            releases that proposers may require in order for these members of the Evaluation

                                          7
             team to access the “sandbox” as described must be provided within seven (7) days
             of notification of proposer’s finalist standing, at no cost to the University. Failure
             to meet this requirement will result in elimination of the proposal from further
             consideration.

2.5   Proposal organization and format

      Proposals should be printed and submitted on 8.5 by 11 inch paper bound securely. The
      required DVD should be securely attached to the Original. Proposals should be organized
      and presented in the order and by the number assigned in the RFP. Proposals should not
      contain URLs or web addresses containing information that is part of the proposal.
      Evaluators will not visit URLs contained in proposals and will not consider or
      evaluate information located at such URLs. Proposals must be organized with the
      following headings and subheadings. Each heading and subheading should be separated
      by tabs or otherwise clearly marked.

             4.1.3, must be responded to with either "Meets this requirement" or "Does not

             mandatory requirements have been met as described in section 3.1 prior to
             proceeding to the next step of the evaluation process.

         •   Section 4.2 Company Overview

      Failure to provide any requested information in the prescribed format may result in
      disqualification of the proposal.

2.6   Multiple proposals


                                           8
          Multiple proposals from a vendor will be permissible; however, each proposal must
          conform fully on its own to the requirements for proposal submission. Each such
          proposal must be submitted separately and labeled as Proposal #1, Proposal #2, etc. on
          each page included in the response. Alternate acquisition plans (varying Cost Proposals)
          do not constitute multiple proposals.

    2.7   Oral presentations and site visits

          Top scoring vendors based on an evaluation of the written proposal may be required to
          participate in interviews and/or site visits to support and clarify their proposals, if
          requested by the University. The University will make every reasonable attempt to
          schedule each presentation at a time and location that is agreeable to the proposer.
          Failure of a proposer to interview or permit a site visit on the date scheduled may result
          in rejection of the vendor's proposal.

    2.8   Demonstrations

          Top-scoring vendor(s) may be required to install and demonstrate the proposed
          product(s) and/or service(s) at a UW site, or to provide guest access to a fully functional
          demonstration site so UW evaluators can review and test the proposed product(s). This
          may include usability and accessibility testing of any kind, as deemed necessary by the
          University.

          Product(s) being demonstrated must be available and ready for UW evaluators’ use upon
          two (2) weeks’ notice. The University will furnish detailed specifications concerning the
          details of this requirement on request. Failure of a vendor to furnish the product(s) and/or
          service(s) it has proposed for demonstration within the time constraints of the preceding
          paragraph may result in rejection of that proposal. Failure of any product(s) and/or
          service(s) to meet the University’s specified requirements during the demonstration may
          result in rejection of the vendor's proposal.

          The successful demonstration of the vendor's product(s) and/or service(s) does not
          constitute acceptance by the University. Any product(s) and/or service(s) furnished by
          the vendor for the purposes of this demonstration must be identical in every respect to
          those which will be furnished if a contract results.

    2.9   Withdrawal of proposals

          Proposals shall be irrevocable until contract award unless the proposal is withdrawn.
          Proposers may withdraw a proposal in writing at any time up to the proposal closing date
          and time if such request is received by the RFP project manager. To accomplish this, the
          written request must be signed by an authorized representative of the proposer and
          submitted to the RFP project manager. If a previously submitted proposal is withdrawn
          before the proposal due date and time, the proposer may submit another proposal at any
          time up to the proposal closing date and time.

3   PROPOSAL SELECTION AND AWARD PROCESS

    3.1   Preliminary evaluation


                                                9
      Accepted proposals will be reviewed initially to determine if mandatory requirements are
      met. Failure to meet mandatory requirements will result in rejection of the
      proposal. In the event that all vendors fail to meet one or more of the mandatory
      requirements, the University reserves the right to continue the evaluation of the proposals
      and to select the proposal which most closely meets the requirements specified in this
      RFP.

3.2   Proposal scoring

      Various costing methodologies and models are available to analyze the cost information
      to determine the lowest cost to UWS. UWS personnel will select one method for scoring
      costs and will use it consistently throughout its analysis of all the cost proposals. UWS
      will determine at its sole discretion the cost proposal scoring methodology. This may, at
      the sole discretion of the University, include Total Cost of Ownership scoring.

      Accepted proposals will be reviewed by an evaluation committee and scored against the
      stated criteria. No proposer or proposer’s employee or agent may contact any
      member of an evaluation committee except at the UWS’s direction. The committee
      may review references, request interviews, and/or conduct on-site visits and use the
      results in scoring the proposals.

3.3   Supplier Diversity
      Proposals from certified Minority Business Enterprises and Disabled Veteran owned
      businesses may have points weighted by a factor of 1.00 to 1.05 to provide up to a five
      percent (5%) preference to these businesses (Wis. Stats. 16.75(3m)). The evaluation
      committee's scoring will be tabulated and proposals ranked based on the numerical scores
      received.

3.4   Evaluation criteria

      The proposals will be scored using the following criteria:

             Description                                           Percent

      1.     Functional Requirements                                30%

      2.     Technical Requirements                                 30%

3.5   Right to reject proposals and negotiate contract terms

      The University reserves the right to reject any and all proposals. The University may
      negotiate the terms of the contract, including the award amount, prior to entering into a
      contract.

3.6   Award and final offers

      The University will compile the final scores for each proposal. The award will be
      granted in one of two ways. The award may be granted to the highest scoring responsive
      and responsible proposer. Alternatively, the highest scoring proposer or proposers may
      be requested to submit final and best offers. If final and best offers are requested by the
      University and submitted by the vendor, they will be evaluated against the stated criteria,
      scored and ranked by the evaluation committee. The award then will be granted to the
      highest scoring proposer. However, a proposer should not expect that the University will
      request a final and best offer.

              rather included in the separate Cost Proposal Form.

     5.1. Functional Requirements – 30% of total score

        5.1.1.       The University of Wisconsin (UW) System is seeking a Digital Learning
                    Environment to succeed its current Learning Management System. A Digital
                    Learning Environment in this context is considered to be the digital “hub” for a
                    confederation of services and tools that support teaching and learning, versus
                    simply an administrative tool for managing course content.

                    Please provide a high level overview of your product and a high level description
                    of how it would address the needs of the University of Wisconsin System.
                    Comprehensive information about the University of Wisconsin System and its
                    organization, campuses, mission, guiding principles, vision, strengths, challenges,
                    environment, and other relevant information is available at
                    https://www.wisconsin.edu/

                    Do not substitute generic marketing materials for a response specifically geared to
                    the University of Wisconsin’s mission, goals, environment and priorities.

        5.1.2.      Describe in detail any ways in which your proposed solution differs from the
                    assumption that each proposed solution includes a common, industry-wide, base,
                    LMS toolset (e.g., course news area, calendar, content repository, quiz tool,
                    discussion tool, and gradebook.).

                                                       SCENARIOS

                    Please read the following information carefully before responding.

                    The scenario method of evaluation allows the University to focus its evaluation
                    most efficiently on those aspects of proposed solutions that matter most to us.

                    The University assumes that each proposed solution includes a common, industry-
                    wide, base, LMS toolset (e.g., course news area, calendar, content repository,
                    assignment-submission tool, quiz tool, discussion tool, and gradebook.). If your
                    solution differs from this assumption, provide details in Section 5.1.2 below.

                    Each scenario will be scored based on innovation, creativity, simplicity,
                    effectiveness, and completeness in addressing the challenges in the scenario, as
                    well as ease of use.

                    Proposals will not be penalized for the inclusion of third-party tools in creating
                    scenario solutions. The cost of any third-party tools used in addressing the

                                                  13
         following scenarios will not be scored. Rather, the ability to meet the
         University’s teaching and learning needs elegantly is of utmost importance.

         Learning analytics, media management, web conferencing, and ePortfolio
         tools are considered third-party tools/services for this purpose.

                    HOW TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING SCENARIOS

         For each scenario below, proposer must submit a narrative describing how its
         proposed solution would address the given scenario, and a video or animation of
         less than 5 minutes duration illustrating the solution described in the narrative.

         Describe in detail any ways in which your proposed solution differs from the
         assumption that each proposed solution includes a common, industry-wide, base,
         LMS toolset (e.g., course news area, calendar, content repository, assignment-
         submission tool, quiz tool, discussion tool, and gradebook).



5.1.3.   SCENARIO #1

         Instructor Perspective

         Dr. Smith teaches a large, 120 student, Introduction to Biology course every
         semester. She completely redesigned her course in Fall 2016 using your solution.
         Dr. Smith is teaching the same course in Spring 2017. She would like to set up
         and run the Spring 2016 course just as she did during the Fall 2016 semester.
         However, Dr. Smith also sets up her course so that one piece or set of content
         (i.e., course file, link, quiz, discussion, etc.) must be accessed and successfully
         completed by the student before the student can move on to the next set of
         content. How would Dr. Smith leverage the learning environment to replicate her
         Fall 2016 course in creating her in Spring 2017 course? What best practices
         should Dr. Smith use to make modifications to the Spring 2017 course in an
         effective and efficient manner? If the content organization, gradebook logic,
         quizzes, and discussions are the same for both courses, what manual changes
         would the instructor need to make to ensure the course is ready for Spring 2017?



5.1.4.   SCENARIO #2

         Student and Instructor Perspectives

         It is imperative that the learning environment, with or without third party tools
         integrated, fosters and supports collaboration and communication between and
         among instructors and students. Dr. Jones teaches a Business Management course
         that is structured around group work, and includes a capstone group project. The
         35-student course is typically self-divided by students into five groups, with seven
         students in each group.




                                      14
         Part A: To facilitate group work on the project, Dr. Jones requires the ability to
         use your solution to support the following activities electronically:

         •   Distribution of course materials at the group level (not to an individual student
             or the entire class).

         •   Facilitation of two-way communication between and among students, groups
             and the instructor on a synchronous and asynchronous basis, in written, audio
             and video formats.

         •   Creation and Administration of assessments and feedback (including grading)
             at the group level.

         Part B: Students require the ability to use your solution to support the following
         activities electronically:

         •   Submission of group work

         •   Facilitation of two-way communication between and among students, groups
             and the instructor on an synchronous and asynchronous basis, in written,
             audio and video formats

         •   Peer (group to group) feedback

         How does your solution support group work as outlined in Parts A & B?



5.1.5.   SCENARIO #3

         Inclusion of Guests into the Learning Environment

         Using Scenario 2 as a basis, how are guests (those not affiliated with the UW
         System) able to communicate and interact with students, groups, and instructors
         using your solution?

5.1.6.   SCENARIO #4

         Administrator Perspective

         Jen Atkins is a Learning Management System administrator for one of the UW
         system institutions. She is charged with maintaining courses, including fulfilling
         instructor requests for courses that are not automatically created using the
         institution’s student information system (SIS) to populate course and user data.
         Ms. Atkins also fulfills many requests for data, including detailed statistics about
         system and tool usage and user behavior within the environment. She also
         regularly modifies, combines and deletes user roles and user permissions.

         How can your solution be leveraged effectively and efficiently to support Jen in
         fulfilling her responsibilities to manage and maintain the learning environment,
         including incorporation of user data that is not brought in through an SIS
         integration (non-matriculated students, for example), generation of usage
                                       15
         statistics, maintenance of user roles and permissions, as well as management of
         the course creation, curation, and archiving process?

5.1.7.   SCENARIO #5

         Student and Instructor Perspectives

         Students live mobile lives and expect their learning environment to support
         anytime, anywhere access to their coursework. Instructors increasingly use active
         teaching techniques that include activities outside the classroom.

         Anthony Yang is an instructor in the Art Department and often assigns activities
         that require the student to be in non-classroom settings, such as museums, parks,
         and other public spaces. How does your solution, either with or without the
         integration of 3rd -party tools, support a student’s mobile access to the solution’s
         toolset to

            •   produce and upload a photo or video assignment?

            •   complete an onsite quiz assessment?

            •   create an onsite reflection discussion post using a wireless, mobile device
                (e.g., “smart” phone, tablet, laptop, etc.)?

         In your narrative, include a description of how your product’s mobility could be
         negatively impacted by environmental factors (i.e., factors outside the control of
         your company, your product or the client product administrator(s)).

5.1.8.   SCENARIO #6

         Student and Instructor Perspectives

         Professor Denton requires that her engineering students learn and use
         mathematical and scientific expressions. Show how equation creation and editing
         by both instructors and students can be made available within your solutions
         assessment toolset or through integration with a third-party solution.

5.1.9.   SCENARIO #7

         Student Perspective

         The look and feel of many learning environments are instructor or administrator
         controlled. What are your recommended best practices for leveraging your
         solution to accommodate main stream, third-party assistive tools that support all
         learners? UWS is very interested in learning about the flexibility of your solution
         so that it can accommodate individual learning differences. It is particularly
         important that the learning environment be enabled to support differing learning
         styles, accommodate low vision, deaf, hard of hearing, or other varying student
         abilities. What best practices do you recommend so a student with low vision can
         modify your solution’s learning environment interface to meet his or her needs?
         To address specific student needs, describe how your solution supports instructor

                                       16
                 configuration of the time allotted for completion of a course activity at the
                 individual, student level.



   5.1.10.       SCENARIO #8


                 Administrative Needs for Data Generated in the Learning Environment


                 Ray is the Financial Aid officer at his campus. Per federal regulations, higher
                 education institutions that support the provision of financial aid for students are
                 required to monitor student academic activity, as defined by the United States
                 Department of Education. To meet federal regulations, Ray needs the ability to
                 identify students enrolled in an online course at his institution who have not had a
                 sufficient level of student activity (e.g., create a discussion posting, complete a
                 quiz, engage with the instructor, etc.) in a course during the current term.
                 Demonstrate how your company’s solution can be leveraged to meet Ray’s need
                 for reliable “student activity” information he needs for federal regulation
                 compliance.

                     DESIGNATION OF CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

The attached material submitted in response to Bid/Proposal RG-17-2663 includes proprietary and confidential information
which qualifies as a trade secret, as provided in s. 19.36(5), Wis. Stats., or is otherwise material that can be kept confidential
under the Wisconsin Open Records Law. As such, we ask that certain pages, as indicated below, of this bid/proposal
response be treated as confidential material and not be released without our written approval.

Prices always become public information when bids/proposals are opened, and therefore cannot be kept
confidential.

Other information cannot be kept confidential unless it is a trade secret. Trade secret is defined in s. 134.90(1)(c), Wis.
Stats. as follows: "Trade secret" means information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method,
technique or process to which all of the following apply:
 1. The information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and
     not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its
     disclosure or use.
 2. The information is the subject of efforts to maintain its secrecy that are reasonable under the circumstances.

We request that the following pages not be released

Section                                            Page #                  Topic

IN THE EVENT THE DESIGNATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY OF THIS INFORMATION IS CHALLENGED, THE
UNDERSIGNED HEREBY AGREES TO PROVIDE LEGAL COUNSEL OR OTHER NECESSARY ASSISTANCE TO DEFEND
THE DESIGNATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND AGREES TO HOLD THE STATE HARMLESS FOR ANY COSTS OR
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE STATE'S AGREEING TO WITHHOLD THE MATERIALS.

Failure to include this form in the bid/proposal response may mean that all information provided as part of the bid/proposal response
will be open to examination and copying. The state considers other markings of confidential in the bid/proposal document to be
insufficient. The undersigned agrees to hold the state harmless for any damages arising out of the release of any materials unless they
are specifically identified above.

    Vendor Agreement
                                       Wisconsin’s Cooperative Purchasing Service

Wisconsin statutes (s. 16.73, Wis. Stats.) establish authority to allow Wisconsin municipalities to purchase from state contracts.
Participating in the service gives vendors opportunities for additional sales without additional bidding. Municipalities use the
service to expedite purchases. A "municipality" is defined as any county, city, village, town, school district, board of school
directors, sewer district, drainage district, vocational, technical and adult education district, or any other public body having the
authority to award public contracts (s. 16.70(8), Wis. Stats.). Federally recognized Indian tribes and bands in this state may
participate in cooperative purchasing with the state or any municipality under ss. 66.0301(1) and (2), Wis.Stats.

Interested municipalities:

         •   will contact the contractor directly to place orders referencing the state agency contract number; and

         •   are responsible for receipt, acceptance, inspection of commodities directly from the contractor, and making payment
             directly to the contractor.

The State of Wisconsin is not a party to these purchases or any dispute arising from these purchases and is not liable for delivery
or payment of any of these purchases.

The State of Wisconsin will determine the contractor’s participation by checking a box below.

        MANDATORY: Bidders/Proposers must agree to furnish the commodities or services of this bid/proposal to Wisconsin
        municipalities. Vendors should note any special conditions below.

        OPTIONAL: Bidders/Proposers may or may not agree to furnish the commodities or services of this bid/proposal to
        Wisconsin municipalities. A vendor’s decision on participating in this service has no effect on awarding this contract.

        A vendor in the service may specify minimum order sizes by volume or dollar amount, additional charges beyond normal
        delivery areas, or other minimal changes for municipalities.

        Vendor: please check one of the following boxes in response.

                   I Agree to furnish the commodities or services of this bid/proposal to Wisconsin municipalities with any special
                   conditions noted below.
                   I Do Not Agree to furnish the commodities or services to Wisconsin municipalities.
