by the ADA. Five  relevant extracts from  that
Five relevant extracts from that section follow:manual follow.
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
   A. The form is designed so that the name and address (Item 3) of the third-party payer receiving the claim (insurance company/dental
       benefit plan) is visible in a standard #10 window envelope. Please fold the form using the ‘tick-marks’ printed in the margin.
   B. In the upper-right of the form, a blank space is provided for the convenience of the payer or insurance company, to allow the
      assignment of a claim or control number.
   C. All Items in the form must be completed unless it is noted on the form or in the following instructions that completion is not required.
   D. When a name and address field is required, the full name of an individual or a full business name, address and zip code must be entered.
   E. All dates must include the four-digit year.
   F. If the number of procedures reported exceeds the number of lines available on one claim form, the remaining procedures must be
      listed on a separate, fully completed claim form.
COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB)
When a claim is being submitted to the secondary payer, complete the form in its entirety and attach the primary payer’s Explanation of Benefits
(EOB) showing the amount paid by the primary payer. You may indicate the amount the primary carrier paid in the “Remarks” field (Item # 35).
NATIONAL PROVIDER IDENTIFIER (NPI)
49 and 54 NPI (National Provider Indentifier): This is an identifier assigned by the Federal government to all providers considered to be
          HIPAA covered entities. Dentists who are not covered entities may elect to obtain an NPI at their discretion, or may be
          enumerated if required by a participating provider agreement with a third-party payer or applicable state law/regulation. An NPI
          is unique to an individual dentist (Type 1 NPI) or dental entity (Type 2 NPI), and has no intrinsic meaning. Additional information
          on NPI and enumeration can be obtained from the ADA’s Internet Web Site: www.ada.org/goto/npi
ADDITIONAL PROVIDER IDENTIFIER
52A and 58 Additional Provider ID: This is an identifier assigned to the billing dentist or dental entity other than a Social Security
           Number (SSN) or Tax Identification Number (TIN). It is not the provider’s NPI. The additional identifier is sometimes referred
           to as a Legacy Identifier (LID). LIDs may not be unique as they are assigned by different entities (e.g., third-party payer; Federal
           government). Some Legacy IDs have an intrinsic meaning.
PROVIDER SPECIALTY CODES
    56A Provider Specialty Code: Enter the code that indicates the type of dental professional who delivered the treatment. Available
         codes describing treating dentists are listed below. The general code listed as ‘Dentist’ may be used instead of any other dental
         practitioner code.
