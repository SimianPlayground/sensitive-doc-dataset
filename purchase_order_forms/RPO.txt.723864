Request for Purchase Order Form Application

You do not need FileMaker Pro to use this program.

Once you have properly installed the compressed program, you should see a folder
called "RPO.fmp". Inside that folder you will find two files - "RPO.fmp" and
"RPO_original.fmp". Double click on the "RPO_original.fmp" file and the program
should begin running. If you have used the computer version of this form before
or are familiar with FileMaker Pro, most of the functions should be familiar to
you.

Your RPO program has no records to begin. In order to create a new record you
must go to the menu bar and select "Record/New Record". You may note there is a
key combination you may use.

Fill in all the information as you would on a hard copy of this document.

You must fill in QTY and UNIT PRICE and the program will automatically compute
the EXTENSION and SUB-TOTAL. You have two lines to describe the item, but you
may use as many as necessary. Simply do not enter information into the QTY and
UNIT PRICE fields and move to the next DESCRIPTION line.

You must compute the tax and enter the information. Again the program will add
the SUB-TOTAL, SALES TAX, and FREIGHT CHARGES to get the GRAND TOTAL.

The last step is to print the form out and sign it.

This program will store all of the PO's you create. If you have to create a
second PO for the same vendor, you may find your previously created PO and
duplicate it. You will then only have to change the dates, item information, and
possibly the account numbers. Again, those commands are located in the menu bar
under "Record".
