           information assists the City in determining the firm’s understanding of the

           desired. Include any other cost and price information, plus a not-to-exceed
           amount, that would be contained in a potential agreement with the City . The
           hourly rates may be used for pricing the cost of additional services outlined in
           the Scope of Work.

          PLEASE NOTE: The City of Palo Alto does not pay for services before it
          receives them. Therefore, do not propose contract terms that call for upfront
          payments or deposits.

6. CONTRACT TYPE AND METHOD OF PAYMENT

   It is anticipated that the agreement resulting from this solicitation, if awarded, will be
   a not-to-exceed budget per fixed fee form of contract. A Sample Agreement of
   Services is provided as Attachment C. The method of payment to the successful
   Proposer shall be on a per fixed fee basis with a maximum “not to exceed” fee as set
   by the Proposer in the proposal or as negotiated between the Proposer and the City
   as being the maximum cost to perform all work. This figure shall include direct costs
   and overhead, such as, but limited to, transportation, communications, subsistence
   and materials and any subcontracted items of work. Progress payments will be
   based on a percentage of project completed.

   Proposers shall be prepared to accept the terms and conditions of the Agreement,
   including Insurance Requirements in Attachment F. If a Proposer desires to take
   exception to the Agreement, Proposer shall provide the following information in
   Chapter 7 of their submittal package. Please include the following:

             including all relevant Attachments.
            Proposer shall furnish the reasons for, as well as specific
             recommendations, for alternative language.

   The above factors will be taken into account in evaluating proposals. Proposals that
   take substantial exceptions to the proposed Agreement may be determined by the
   City , at its sole discretion, to be unacceptable and no longer considered for award.

   Insurance Requirements

   The selected Proposer(s), at Proposer’s sole cost and expense and for the full term
   of the Agreement or any extension thereof, shall obtain and maintain, at a minimum,
   all of the insurance requirements outlined in Attachment F.

   approval of the Risk Manager of the City of Palo Alto as to form and content.   These
   requirements are subject to amendment or waiver if so approved in writing       by the
   Risk Manager. The selected Proposer agrees to provide the City with a copy      of said
   policies, certificates and/or endorsement upon award of contract.

its preferred vendor for an Enterprise Resource Planning system with the purpose of
integrating various business processes within the City and to pave the path for the City

implementation of the SAP Enterprise Central Component (ECC 6.0), SAP core
modules were completed and the SAP system has been running in the City since 2003,
supporting Accounting, Finance, Purchasing, Project Management, Plant Maintenance,
Budgeting, Payroll, Human Resource Management, and Service Order Management. In
2009, the City completed a major upgrade to the SAP ERP system, which also replaced
the former utility billing system (Banner) with the implementation of the SAP IS-U
module, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Utilities Customer Electronic
Services (also known as My Utilities Account customer portal) and Business Intelligence
systems (BI). Both business and technology needs have changed dramatically since the
current ERP solution was selected and implemented.

                                                            IT Requirements




                IT Requirements for New Technology
                Purpose: The purpose of this document is to outline requirements that will be utilized for all new
                software purchases. Selecting vendors that meet these requirements will help to ensure that the City
                minimizes risk, increases efficiencies and new technologies align to the City’s IT strategy. If for some
                reason all non‐functional requirements cannot be met by any vendor, the City’s project manager is to
                work with the City’s IT Governance & Planning Manager on next steps.


Classification definition:
                     Mandatory features must be included for the system to function.
                     Required features should be included but the system can function without them.
                     Desired features are nice to have but are not needed for the system to function.

Instructions: Create a product backlog to track the results of your elicitations. Prioritize, and reorganize the elicitation results by
categories. The list will become your Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Your WBS does not have to have all the below categories; it
depends on the type, size, and complexity of your project, but it should have at least:

                     Features and Functions
                     Implementation Management (Consultation Activities )
                     Procurement Activities
                     Training Activities
                     Support
                     User Acceptance Activities
