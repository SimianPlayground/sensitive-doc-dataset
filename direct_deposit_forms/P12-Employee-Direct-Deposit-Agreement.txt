To enroll in Direct Deposit, simply fill out this form and give to your payroll manager. Attach a voided check for each checking account - not a
deposit slip. If depositing to a savings account, ask your bank to give you the Routing/Transit Number for your account. It isn’t always the same as
the number on a savings deposit slip. This will help ensure that you are paid correctly.

Below is a sample check MICR line, detailing where the information necessary to complete this form can be found.




IMPORTANT! Please read and sign before completing and submitting.
I hereby authorize Payroll Specialists, Inc. its agents and/or affiliates (hereafter “PSI”) to deposit any amounts owed me, as instructed by my
employer, by initiating credit entries to my account at the financial institution (hereinafter “Bank”) indicated on this form. Further, I authorize Bank
to accept and to credit any credit entries indicated by PSI to my account. In the even that PSI deposits funds erroneously into my account, I
authorize PSI to debit my account for an amount not to exceed the original amount of the erroneous credit. This authorization is to remain in full
force and effect until PSI and Bank have received written notice from me of its termination in such time and in such manner as to afford PSI and
Bank reasonable opportunity to act on it.
