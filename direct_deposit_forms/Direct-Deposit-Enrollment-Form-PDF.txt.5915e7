                  Employee Direct Deposit Enrollment Form

Please fill out this form and return to the Finance Department. Attach a voided check for each checking
account. If you are depositing into a savings account, ask your bank for the routing number. If you need
to change an account that already has direct deposit, please list the old account information and check
the “Delete” box. Then provide the new account information on the following line and check the “Add”
box.

                            Please read and sign before completing and submitting.

         I hereby authorize Paylocity to deposit any amounts owed to me, as instructed by The Town of Ellington, by
initiating credit entries to my account at the financial institution (“Bank”) indicated on this form. Further, I
authorize the Bank to accept and to credit any credit entries indicated by Paylocity to my account. In the event that
Paylocity deposits funds erroneously into my account, I authorize Paylocity to debit my account for an amount not to
exceed the original amount of the erroneous credit.
         This authorization is to remain in full force and effect until Paylocity and the Bank have received written
notice from me of its termination in such time and in such manner as to afford Paylocity and the Bank reasonable
opportunity to act on it.
