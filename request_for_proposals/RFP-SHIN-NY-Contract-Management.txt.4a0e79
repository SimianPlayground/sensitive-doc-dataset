  I.   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

The Statewide Health Information Network for New York (SHIN-NY) is made up of 8 regional
organizations providing Health Information Exchange services as well as a centralized Enterprise
Bus and Record Locater Services hosted by New York eHealth Collaborative (NYeC). The
enterprise system of all 9 organizations and independent systems allows exchange of patient
clinical records across New York State. NYeC has been identified as the SHIN-NY State Designated
Entity (SDE).

NYeC is expanding its contracting responsibilities and is therefore looking for a fully functional
system to manage the flow of contracts within the organization and across multiple vendors.
NYeC would like to use a Contract Management System to streamline contracting processes,
improve consistency of contracts across the organization, enable better tracking of contract
progress, voucher vendors, track contract compliance and reduce the overhead associated with
managing the contracts life cycle.



 II.   BACKGROUND INFORMATION

The SHIN-NY is a network of networks comprised of eight Regional Health Information
Organizations now referred to as Qualified Entities (QE). Each QE operates its own network that
aggregates electronic health records (EHRs) from participating providers in their regions. They
are interconnected through a SHIN-NY hub via the statewide patient record lookup (sPRL).
Together, the eight QEs connect data from acute care hospitals in New York State, provider
systems, individual providers, laboratories, public health departments and other data sources.
With the release of the SHIN-NY Regulation on March 9, 2016, QEs are expected to see an
increase of healthcare facility participants that are regulated by the New York State Department
of Health (NYS DOH) under Public Health law and that are required to connect to the SHIN-NY. It
is also a goal of the SHIN-NY to increase usage across all sectors of healthcare, including those
providers and facilities that are not regulated to connect.

NYeC will award a single contract for this work and the selected vendor will be expected to
implement a system that meets all deliverables specified in the contract by December 2017.

   •   Fax received during the negotiation phase will enter the repository automatically, link
       with the correct negotiation, and trigger an alert to the appropriate parties
   •   Graphical approval workflows, that can display where a contract is in the approval
       process, who still needs to approve it, and can note the role and relevance of each
