Certification
I, the undersigned, have incurred the expenses listed above that qualify for reimbursement under my employer’s cafeteria plan. I have not been
and will not be reimbursed for these expenses from any source including, but not limited to, insurance, this plan, or other programs offered by
my, or my spouses, employer. I understand these expenses may no longer be claimed as deductions for income tax purposes since I am
requesting reimbursement with funds deducted from my compensation on a pre-tax basis. I acknowledge I am solely liable for any taxes or
penalties on ineligible expenses submitted through the medical flexible spending account. I, and only I, am responsible for the accuracy and
validity of the submitted expenses and will retain substantiation. I hereby request reimbursement for these expenses, and, if applicable, reaffirm
the authorization provided to Cafeteria Plan Advisors, Inc. to directly deposit the reimbursement into my bank.
