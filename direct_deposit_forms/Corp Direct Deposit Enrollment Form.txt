                               Employee Direct Deposit Enrollment Form
To enroll in Direct Deposit, simply fill out this form and give to your payroll Department. Attach a voided check for each checking
account - not a deposit slip. If depositing to a savings account, ask your bank to give you the Routing/Transit Number for your
savings account. It is not always the same as the number on a savings deposit slip. This will help ensure that you are paid correctly.
Below is a sample check MICR line, detailing where the information necessary to complete this form can be found.
