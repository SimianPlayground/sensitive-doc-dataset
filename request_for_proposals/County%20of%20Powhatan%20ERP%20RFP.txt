1 RFP Introduction and Background

1.1       Introduction
This Request for Proposals (RFP) is intended to solicit Proposals from Respondents capable of
satisfying the County of Powhatan and the Powhatan County Public Schools (County) needs for
software and professional services to implement a new software systems environment to address the
County’s needs related to:
      •    Financial management
      •    Human capital management
      •    Tax billing and revenue collections
      •    Utility billing
      •    Asset management and work orders, and
      •    Community Development
Respondent’s responses will be evaluated and ranked based on the criteria described in this RFP. If a
system is available that meets the County’s needs, the County may then enter into contract discussions
with the selected Respondent(s).
It is important to note that the County and Schools are separate legal entities; however, the goal will be
to implement one financial management and human capital management solution to meet the needs of
both entities. The County will expect Offerors to propose an implementation approach that considers
this unique requirement, and explains any assumptions or experience in detail through the proposal
response.
In addition to soliciting written responses, this document provides information to assist Respondents in
preparing their responses, and facilitates the subsequent evaluation and comparison process. In that
regard, this RFP:
      •    Provides information essential to soliciting meaningful recommendations and realistic
           commitments from the Respondents
      •    Specifies the desired format and content of Proposals in response to this RFP
      •    Outlines the County’s evaluation and selection procedures
      •    Establishes a schedule for the preparation and submission of Proposals in response to this RFP
      •    Establishes a performance standard for the selected Respondent

This RFP and the selected Proposal in response to this RFP will be incorporated into the contract
resulting from this solicitation. For purposes of this RFP, the term “Vendor,” “Respondent,” and
“Proposer” are considered to have the same meaning.

1.3   Project Objectives
The County is planning to replace its current software systems environment with a new system or
combination of software systems, and to adopt systems functionality to support core processes. In doing
so, the County seeks to address several challenges in the current environment, and gain future
efficiencies, including, but not limited to:

                                                                                              Page 5 of 33
                                                                                           County of Powhatan
                                                                                          Request for Proposals
                                                                                                RFP #2019-01

      •    Challenges in Current Environment and Opportunities for Improvement/Objectives:

              o   The reporting capabilities of the existing system are limited. The current system lacks
                  key reporting capabilities, making it difficult to monitor metrics and forcing staff to track
                  metrics outside the system.

              o   The current systems do not adequately support all of the County’s functional needs. Staff
                  are using manual paper and MS Excel processes to manage many of their departments.

              o   Duplicate data entry is required for multiple core business functions. A lack of integration
                  between modules within BAI and between BAI and external systems creates the need
                  to duplicate entry of information. Currently, many departments monitor their budgets
                  using MS Excel, duplicating the entry of purchasing details to maintain a current view
                  into their available budget.

              o   The budget preparation process is managed external to BAI. The process for developing
                  department budgets and creating a budget for County and Board of Supervisors approval
                  is performed through use of MS Excel, MS Word, and email. The budget is not loaded
                  into BAI until after the final budget has been approved and after the year-end process is
                  completed.

              o   HR processes are primarily manual and paper-based. HR functions in the systems are
                  limited, which requires most processes to be manual and paper-based. This also
                  requires additional paper documentation to be maintained outside of the system.

              o   The County is not tracking purchase order encumbrances in BAI. Some departments
                  use purchase orders, but primarily for tracking purposes. A Countywide purchasing
                  process is not used in BAI, which results in a lack of comprehensive encumbrance and
                  budget tracking.

In order to address these challenges and others, the County has initiated a project to adequately plan
for, select, and implement a replacement or upgraded Software Systems environment. Section 2.0 –
Project Scope, outlines the features and functionality desired in a future system(s), as well as the
professional services necessary to implement that system(s).

The primary objective is to procure, implement, and maintain a system or systems that mitigate the
challenges listed above, allow for streamlined collection and processing of information, and to facilitate
standardization and timely access to information by maximizing the use of the new software system(s)
capabilities.

      2.2    Alternate Proposals, Partnerships and Proposers of Subsets of Functionality
      Alternate Proposals:

              •     Respondents may submit alternate Proposals for evaluation. For example, if a Proposer
                    offers one or more “branded” products that may meet the needs of the County they are
                    encouraged to separately propose each software package for consideration.
              •     Software companies that deliver their solution through one or more consulting firms (system
                    integrators) are also allowed to submit more than one Proposal for consideration through
                    differing consulting firms.

              •     A separate Proposal package submitted in accordance with Section 4 is required in order
                    for the County to accurately evaluate each Proposal independent of the other.


                                                                                                    Page 12 of 33
                                                                                         County of Powhatan
                                                                                        Request for Proposals
                                                                                              RFP #2019-01

Partnerships:
Respondents are encouraged to establish partnership relationships to fully provide all requirements
defined by the RFP.
       •   Respondents engaged in a partnership relationship shall submit a single proposal in
           response to this RFP.
       •   Partnership relationships shall be clearly defined by proposal responses. Such definition
           shall identify the entity in the partnership relationship deemed to be the Prime Vendor. In the
           event a proposal that presents a partnership is selected, it is expected that a single contract
           be executed between the County and the Prime Vendor, and the Prime Vendor be
           responsible for any contractual relationship with the proposed partner(s).
       •   Each Vendor engaged in the partnership shall respond to any and all applicable portions of
           this RFP that relate to the work that will be performed, or the capabilities provided. For
           example, each Vendor shall provide references, and each Vendor shall respond to the
           Company Background and History questions.

Proposers of Subsets of Functionality:

As part of this process the County will be allowing Respondents to submit point solutions (best of breed),
and encourages Respondents to participate in this process in order to consider and evaluate a range
of marketplace offerings.
       •   The County recognizes that the scope of functionality in this RFP may be met through a
           combination of systems that specialize on a modular or functional area basis. The County is
           willing to consider best-of-breed solutions (“point” solutions), subject to certain conditions as
           outlined in this section.
       •   The County has a preference on software solutions that provide for the highest level of fit,
           and facilitate the exchange of information between any disparate systems.
       •   Proposers are also encouraged to propose on a subset of functionality if the proposed
           software cannot provide functionality for all requested modules. Proposers may propose
           solutions that address a subset of functionality, provided the software is able to address, at
           a minimum, one of the following areas i-iii:
              i.       Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (Tabs 2-12, and 24 of Attachment B)
             ii.       Tax and Revenue Systems (Tabs 13-18 of Attachment B)
             iii.      Community Development Systems (Tabs 19-23 of Attachment B)
                    This does not preclude vendors from partnering, or addressing more than one of the
                    above (i.-iiii.) areas but is rather intended to identify the minimum scope that must be
                    presented in each proposal.
                    Tab 6 (Accounts Receivable and Cash Receipts) may contain functionality that pertains
                    to each area (i-iii above), and vendors proposing to a subset of functionality shall
                    complete that tab as applicable to the proposed solution.
                    Vendors responding on a subset of functionality must also respond to Tab 1 (General
                    and Technical) and Tabs 25-26 (Interfaces and Data Conversion) of Attachment B.


                                                                                               Page 13 of 33
                                                                                      County of Powhatan
                                                                                     Request for Proposals
                                                                                           RFP #2019-01

       •   The County will consider proposers of a subset of functionality on the relative merit of the
           functionality proposed based on the evaluation criteria laid forth in this RFP, and reserves
           the right to enter into negotiations for one or more proposers in order to achieve a “best–of-
           breed” solution.
       •   The County reserves the right to make one or more awards to competing Offerors for subsets
           of functionality as a result of this RFP. In the event the County should make awards to one
           or more competing Offerors, it shall be expected that additional discussion will take place
           between the County and the Offerors to define requirements and an approach to building an
           integration or interface between the selected systems. In such instance, the County expects
           that the Offerors will work together as necessary to develop the necessary integration once
           one has been identified.

2.3   County and Project Staffing
The County intends to have functional and technical resources available during Project implementation,
though it is noted that the County does not anticipate dedicating staff full-time to the implementation in
addition to managing their core job responsibilities. Additional resource planning will be performed
based upon the selected Respondent(s).

The County currently has 3.0 Full-Time Equivalents (FTE) in the Department of Information Technology,
2.0 FTE in Human Resources, 4.0 FTE in the Finance Department, 5.1 FTE in the Building Department,
6.0 FTE in the Planning & Zoning Department, 19 FTE in the Public Works Department, 7.7 FTE in the
Treasurer’s Office, 7.5 FTE in the Commissioner of Revenue’s Office, and 6 FTE in Utilities. This
information is shared on an informational basis only, and does not commit or warrant that the County
can designate any certain levels of resources to the implementation process, but is rather provided for
context in developing proposals.

Respondents shall clearly indicate in the proposal responses the estimated level of County resource
involvement in the implementation process, in order to allow the County to perform adequate planning.
The County will utilize the response to Respondents’ Resource Hour Estimates in Tab 3 – Project
Approach and Implementation Methodology, of Proposals as an input into the staffing plan the County
develops, and requests that Respondents clearly articulate estimated staffing considerations in their
responses.

The selected vendor(s) will be required to include onsite activities (at County and/or School offices) as
part of the system implementation activities, though the County is open to remote meetings for certain
activities subject to prior review and approval.

2.4   Deployment Model

The County is open to considering various deployment models, and has structured the RFP to allow for
the evaluation of the deployment model as but one factor in the overall procurement process. The
County wishes to evaluate the greatest range of marketplace offerings feasible through this process.

The County recognizes there are many factors contributing to a comparison of cost Proposals for these
various deployment methods including needed infrastructure and/or hardware costs, the potential for
reduced hardware and support costs in hosted/SaaS models, a particular Proposer’s approach to
managing upgrades, and technical staffing needs. It is well understood among the County team that a


                                                                                            Page 14 of 33
                                                                                      County of Powhatan
                                                                                     Request for Proposals
                                                                                           RFP #2019-01

“higher” cost from a SaaS vendor may be equalized by considering these other cost areas when
comparing to an on premise deployment.

The County Schools currently leverage a SaaS Solution for financial management, while the County
and Schools also leverage on premise solutions in other areas.

The County will consider, in no particular order, the following deployment models:
           a. On Premise (locally hosted at the County, perpetual licenses)
           b. Software as a Service (SaaS or subscription-based models)
           c. Proposer hosted (hosted and managed by the Proposer, perpetual licenses)

Cost sheets have been provided under Attachment C1 – Cost Worksheets for pricing each of the
deployment models.

This solicitation is not a bid process nor will it follow a lowest-priced responsive Proposal process, but
will be based on most advantageous Proposal(s) utilizing the Evaluation Criteria listed in the RFP,
including the review of life cycle costs (i.e. recurring costs, hardware, third-party licenses, etc.).

In developing proposals, Proposer’s shall clearly define the proposed deployment model including the
licensing model as well as any perceived benefits of the proposed model. In the event two or more
products are proposed under the same proposal (e.g. through a partnership or offered by the same
company) the Proposer shall clearly indicate in both the technical proposal (Attachment A, Tab 2) and
cost proposal (Attachment C1) the deployment model for each proposed software product.

The County does not have a preference as to a specific hosting location, but does have a preference
toward the hosting being within the contiguous United States. Vendors are requested to specify the
hosting location in proposal responses, specifically as part of Tab 9 to proposal responses (please see
Attachment A for further instruction).

2.5   Number of Users
The anticipated number of future users of a new system or systems will be provided via addenda by the
County, following RFP publication.

2.6   Potential Phasing and Target Live Dates
The County requests that offerors provide potential phase start and target go-live dates in proposal
responses per Attachment A – Proposal Response Forms, Tab 5. These dates should be estimates
based on anticipated resource requirements and dependencies between functional areas. These dates
are subject to negotiation. The County recognizes that the start and go-live dates, as well as the phasing
structure for the implementation may vary based on the selection of the configuration of solutions
selected (e.g. one software solution versus multiple awards or partnerships).

2.7   Current County Applications Environment
The County of Powhatan’s current primary financial management system, BAI, runs on the IBM iSeries
AS/400. Software and support is provided by BAI and the County leases the iSeries. There are currently
no County customizations that were added to the current version of BAI. The current scope of
functionality supported by the current system include those detailed in the table below.

         would involve County IT resources.

2.9       Project Management Documentation
The following information establishes the expectation of the minimum level of project management
documentation to be provided by Respondents as a part of, but not exclusively, the resulting
implementation services offered. As part of the implementation scope, following signing of a contract,

2.10 Budget
The County is committed to fully funding the one-time and recurring annual costs for the acquisition of
the software (whether a licensed model or a subscription model is selected as a result of this process).

                                                                                             Page 17 of 33

Budget planning for this initiative is ongoing, and a specific amount for the software and implementation
services portion has not yet been determined. A final budget will be programmed based on the results
of this RFP and final contract negotiations.

The County is sensitive to the total costs, and has listed cost as one of the several evaluation criteria in
the RFP; however, this is not an opportunity to identify the lowest priced solution. This RFP opportunity
is being presented as a best value solicitation, and not a lowest priced bid, opportunity.




                                                                                              Page 18 of 33

3 Proposal Evaluation and Award

3.1        Evaluation Process
The following subsection outlines the intended proposal evaluation process the County has identified.
The County reserves the right to deviate from this process at its own discretion, and to (i) negotiate any
and all elements of the RFP, (ii) amend, modify, or withdraw the RFP, (iii) revise any requirements under
the RFP, (iv) require supplemental statements of information from any Respondent, (v) extend the
deadline for submission of Proposals, (vi) cancel, in whole or part, this RFP if the County deems it is in
its best interest to do so, (vii) request additional information or clarification of information provided in
any Proposal without changing the terms of the RFP, (viii) waive any portion of the selection process in
order to accelerate the selection and negotiation with the top-ranked Respondent; and/or (ix) award the
contract without written or oral discussions with any Respondents. The County may exercise the
foregoing rights at any time without notice and without liability to any Respondent, or any other party,
for expenses incurred in the preparation of responses hereto or otherwise.

The County reserves the right to reject any or all Proposals or parts of Proposals, to accept part or all
of Proposals on the basis of considerations other than lowest cost, and to create a Project of lesser or
greater expense than described in this RFP or the respondent's reply, based on the component prices
submitted. The County reserves the right to cancel this solicitation or to change its scope if it is
considered to be in the best interest of the County.
      a. Vendor Shortlist: The County Evaluation Committee will initially review and evaluate each
            Proposal received to determine the Proposer’s ability to meet the requirements of the County.
            The evaluation criteria described in Section 3.3 will be the basis for evaluation. The Evaluation
            Committee will determine the Respondents best suited to meet the needs of the County based
            on the scoring of the evaluation criteria. These Vendors will form the Vendor Shortlist.
      b. Vendor Demonstrations: The County, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to have system
            demonstrations with those Respondents on the Vendor Shortlist, or any other Respondent.
            Demonstrations will be conducted at County offices. Demonstrations will involve a scripted
            demonstration. The schedule, scripts, and demonstration requirements will be provided with the
            invitation to participate in demonstrations.
            A Pre-Demonstration Vendor Teleconference will take place for those Vendors that have been
            shortlisted, and Respondents will have an opportunity to review the format of the demonstrations
            and ask questions related to procedure and specific demonstration scenarios. Vendors that are
            invited to participate in demonstrations are advised that the provided scripts must be strictly
            adhered to while presenting. Optional modules or functionality shall not be presented if they fall
            outside the scope of requested functionality or that functionality which has been proposed by
            the Respondents. The proposed version of the software must be shown, and must not include
            any software that is under development or in beta testing. Evaluation Committee members will
            view the demonstrations, and additional County staff may also be in attendance to observe and
            provide informal feedback. The County may elect, at its sole option, not to conduct discussions
            or demonstrations with respondents.
      c.    Reference Checks: The County may employ a process of contacting references provided
            through Respondents’ proposals. This process may include teleconference meetings, web
            conferences, and in-person meetings with references. The County reserves the right to conduct
            reference checks at any point in the evaluation process.
                                                                                                Page 19 of 33

                                                                                            Request for Proposals
                                                                                                  RFP #2019-01

      d. Best and Final Offer and Request for Clarification: A Best-and-Final-Offer process may be
         initiated if it is determined to be in the best interest of the County. Such process may be initiated
         following the identification of the Vendor Shortlist or at any other evaluation process step.
         Additional processes of scope and cost clarification may be employed as part of the evaluation
         process if it is deemed to be in the County’s best interest.

3.2     Clarification and Discussion of Proposals
The County may request clarifications and conduct discussions with any Respondent that submits a
Proposal, including requesting additional information. The County reserves the right to select the
Proposal or Proposals that it believes is the most responsive as determined by the County Evaluation
Committee, which will best serve the County business and operational requirements, considering the
evaluation criteria set forth below. Respondents shall be available for a system demonstration to County
staff on dates specified in Table 02 or as otherwise requested by the County if selected for system
demonstrations. Failure of a Respondent to respond to such a request for additional information,
clarification, or system demonstrations may result in rejection of the Proposal. Clarifications may not
result in a material or substantive change to the Proposal. The initial evaluation may be adjusted
because of a clarification under this section. The County reserves the right to waive irregularities in the
Proposal content or to request supplemental information from Respondents.

3.3     Evaluation Criteria
As described in the preceding Evaluation process sub-section, the County intends to follow a cumulative
approach to scoring based on key evaluation activities (e.g. scoring is conducted in a progressive
manner, following various steps in the process). The County hereby reserves the right to evaluate, at
its sole discretion, the extent to which each Proposal received compares to the stated criteria. Vendor
proposals shall be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria, subject to variation at the sole
discretion of the County:

         3.3.1 Short-List Identification: The County intends to utilize the criteria presented in Table

              and service costs; hardware costs; hosting and associated hardware
              support costs. The County reserves the right to add their own estimates of
              the costs (including any anticipated savings) associated with the required
              level of internal staffing (business users and IT staff) for implementation and
              for ongoing support, hardware and overhead costs and savings, and may
              rely on the Respondent’s resource estimates as a basis for their
              calculations.

              respective functional area group.
