General RFP Information
  SECTION 1: GENERAL INFORMATION

A. RFP PURPOSE

The purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to solicit proposals from software Vendors,
systems integrators, implementation partners and/or Value-Added Resellers (VARs) who can
demonstrate that they possess the organizational, functional and technical capabilities to provide
an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that meets the City’s needs. The functional areas
to be supported are: Financials (AP, AR, Payment processing, GL, Financial statements), Human
Resources, Payroll, Utility Billing, Business License & Permitting, Budgeting, Analytics, and
Reporting. The City’s preference is to select and begin implementation of a replacement ERP
solution in the first quarter of 2020. The City’s budget is expected to cover the entire cost of the
project including, but not limited to, software, hardware, data transfer, interfaces, configuration,
installation, training and the first year’s warranty and support.

B. CITY INTRODUCTION

permitting, licensing, and general administrative services (finance, legal, information technology,
events, human resources, etc.).

The City prepares a biennial comprehensive budget document, including both operating and
capital budgets, which is adopted by the City Council in December for the subsequent fiscal year.
The City’s fiscal year runs January 1 through December 31.

City employees are located at 5 primary locations, City Hall, Fire Station, Police Station, and 2
Public Works buildings. The city’s community center located at Snoqualmie Community Park, is

C. EMPLOYEES & SYSTEM USERS

 As of June 2019, the City employs 120 FTE employees, with a mix of Management/Professional
 positions and employees under three separate union groups (Fire, Police and Professional).

 The anticipated number of users in 2020 is shown below by department:

      use the Payroll Time Entry and Self-Service functionality.
          o Seasonal employees and volunteer firefighters will continue to use existing manual
             timesheet entry

D. CURRENT IT ENVIRONMENT

The City currently uses Accela Springbrook V7.17 for its Financial, Payroll, Utility Billing, Business
License & Permitting. There’s very limited use of Springbrook’s Human Resources, Budgeting, and
Reporting modules & functionality. The City uses GovJobsToday.com for applicant tracking, relies
on Excel for all budgeting preparation, forecast and analytics. The city uses SQL Query with
DevExpress Dashboard to present a graphical representation of the financial operations, however
an integrated solution as part of the ERP is desired. The city uses MyBuildingPermit for online
permit submission & Central Square, TRAKIt for over the counter permit submission and will
continue to do so. MaintStar was acquired for asset management, but is currently not being used
to track assets nor is it integrated into the financial system. Time entry is a mix of paper time
cards and use of Springbrook’s Time Entry Module. Purchase orders and encumbrances aren’t
existing processes at the City and as such these features aren’t currently used in Springbrook,
although the City would like to implement the use of both. Expense reporting is a combination of
paper, and scanned receipts, a more efficient process with possible use of procurement cards is
being considered. The city accepts payments at several locations using a combination of
Springbrook’s cash receipts module, Square at special events and Police Services, checks in person
or by mail, and credit card payments made at City Hall (PayConex) or on-line for Utility Billing only
via MerchantTransact.com.

 Workstations are currently running Windows Office 365 applications for word processing,
 spreadsheets, email, and presentation requirements. IE 11, Chrome or Firefox are the standard
 Web browser. The City uses SharePoint365 for document collaboration and sharing. The City is
 interested in vendors who can help optimize the document repository using existing systems, or
 by providing built-in and flexible document management capabilities.

 Integration
 The City requires the new software to integrate with 3rd party applications and to easily receive
 and transmit data to local, state, and federal agencies. Integration tools must be open and
 support a Microsoft Windows platform, e.g. .NET, Service Oriented Architecture, XML, Web

General RFP Information
 Services, APIs, etc. Prior experience with integration with the City’s existing applications is
 important. The City’s preferred integration between systems is via web services.

 Any proposed on-premise solution should be able to operate in a Virtual Machine environment
 (VM) using VMWare’s virtualization platform.

 The system must provide tight security controls which meet regulatory, compliance and audit
 standards. Security must be role-based to the menu, screen, and data field level.
 Microsoft Active Directory is required for single sign-on and global security administration; LDAP
 compatibility is sufficient.

 The system must support field automation tools such as smart phones, notebooks, laptops, or
 other devices for remote data acquisition and updates. Real time updates are preferred; the
 option to synchronize mobile devices with the system is required. The City wishes to remain
 hardware agnostic.

 Security
 For the client-based solution, we require that the application not be launched from the app data
 folder. For hosted solution, solution must be compatible across all platforms. Hosted solution
 must allow for clean exit and vendor must provide exit strategy & methodology.

 GIS
 The City is currently using ESRI’s ArcGIS 10.2 server and desktop clients. The new software must
 support bi-directional GIS integration.

 The new system should support Google and Bing Map APIs to augment address, location or
 property information. The City is sharing GIS data with the County (King). The City will continue
 to share land and parcel data with the County. The City uses its custom-developed intranet
 site, GeoCortex, to provide base map data and an extensive list of map layers to all staff. This site
 pulls various data sets (quarterly) from applications to create a holistic view of property data
 addresses, structure, land use, infrastructure, etc. The new Software needs to support dynamic
 display of geodata, addresses and streets stored in a centralized database and should be to also
 consume the GIS address table. The City strategy is to serve up geospatial data with the use of
 web services (ARC GIS online/onprem GIS server) or map services (via ESRI) and have the new
 software consume the data directly.

 Reporting
 The City intends to generate its required reports from the new system and prefers flexible ad hoc
 query and reporting tools that are intuitive to users.

 Work Order Management
 The City currently has MaintStar for work order tracking. The City would like to have an
 integrated solution with work orders to update Utility Billing and Project Accounting in order to
 bill for services provided and have the ability to plan, monitor and forecast annual work quantities

General RFP Information
 and required resources (labor, equipment, material, budget) for a variety of infrastructure
 systems at a program level including but not limited to: Right of Way Roadways, surfaces,
 sidewalk, ditches, storm conveyance systems and, assets such as water conveyance infrastructure
 (pumps, valves, main lines), parks, signs, traffic signals, trees, and other municipal
 infrastructure, and sanitary sewer infrastructure (pumps, lift stations, lines).

 Fleet Management: RTA
 The City uses RTA for fleet workorders, tracking vehicle and small equipment maintenance and
 replacement lifecycle. RTA is not integrated with any other systems, and the City would like
 vendors to propose an integrated solution with Asset Management, as well as a direct feed into
 the ERP.

 Asset Management: MaintStar
 The City retains a license to MaintStar’s Asset Module, however it is not currently used to actively
 track assets (either individually or by program). The city would like to have integration between
 MaintStar and the finance systems in order to track asset life cycle, value, repairs and impacts on
 project/program budget. However, the city is open to a wholistic solution that also provides asset
 tracking and management. The new system should provide planned versus actual reports that
 can be produced monthly/cumulatively for specific projects.

 Financial systems
 Springbrook is the financial system used for Utility Billing, General Ledger, AP, AR, Cash
 Accounting, Cash Point of Sale, Licensing, Annual B&O payment processing, cash receipts of
 Permits, and Payroll. Springbrook is used to journalize final budget numbers but is not used for
 budget planning. Springbrook HR module is used in a limited capacity with performance
 management handled offline. Springbrook is not integrated with the Asset Management, Work
 Order Management or GIS systems. Grant management, contract management, project
 management functions are all managed at individual levels using Excel spreadsheets. The
 objective of this project is to replace Springbrook with a financial system that can provide a
 collaborative solution which leverages workflow for process efficiency between departments.

E. PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The City is seeking an integrated “off the shelf” packaged solution that will meet its core
requirements out of the box with minimal modifications.

The City expects the Vendor to perform the related professional services (e.g. best practices
guidance, business process reengineering, training, project management, data migration
assistance, implementation, integration and report development) in a timely and professional
manner. Services should be provided by experienced ERP and technical experts who have
successfully implemented the proposed solution at comparable municipalities with similar
requirements for the modules in scope.

G. PROJECT TIMELINE

 Anticipated Project Timeline
 An anticipated project timeline is provided to provide a sense of the scope of work. However, the
 City recognizes that once a vendor is selected, the desired milestone dates may shift and a
 detailed project schedule will be developed in tandem to meet the City’s timeline as best as
 possible.

 To minimize risk, the city desires working with the vendor to determine the best roll out strategy.
 The city is open to a rolling implementation using an iterative approach and will look to the
 vendor for best practices in reducing customer and employee impacts.

SECTION 3 – VENDOR INSTRUCTIONS


 A. COMMITMENT TO PURCHASE

 The City of Snoqualmie reserves the right to reject any and all proposals, and to waive
 irregularities and informalities in the submittal and evaluation process.

 This RFP does not obligate the City to pay any costs incurred by respondents in the preparation
 and submission of a proposal, including but not limited to respondents doing onsite scripted
 product demonstrations. This Request for Proposal is not a commitment to purchase, and any
 expenditures incurred by the Proposer in preparing and submitting its proposal shall not be
 reimbursed by the City, nor is the City obligated with respect to any action taken by Proposer in
 responding to this Request for Proposal. Further, the City reserves the right to reject all proposals
 received and not award a contract to any Proposer.

 A vendor response that indicates that any of the requested information in this RFP will only be
 provided if and when the supplier is selected as the apparently successful supplier is not acceptable,
 and, at the City’s sole discretion, may disqualify the proposal from consideration.

 The City of Snoqualmie assures that no person shall, on the grounds of race, color, national origin,
 or sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to
 discrimination under any program or activity. The City of Snoqualmie further assures that every
 effort will be made to ensure non-discrimination in all of its programs and activities, whether those
 programs are federally funded or not.

 In addition to nondiscrimination compliance requirements, the Vendor ultimately awarded a
 contract shall comply with federal, state and local laws, statutes and ordinances relative to the
 execution of the work. This requirement includes, but is not limited to, protection of public and
 employee safety and health; environmental protection; waste reduction and recycling; the
 protection of natural resources; permits; fees; taxes; and similar subjects.

 The Vendor (s) ultimately awarded a contract will be required to sign and comply with City of
 Snoqualmie Information Technology Vendor Non-Disclosure Agreement. Vendor providing hosted
 or cloud solution will be required to sign and comply with City of Snoqualmie Information Technology
 Cloud Security policy.

 If the selected Vendor fails to sign the contract within seven (7) business days of delivery of the final
 contract, the City may elect to cancel the award and award the contract to the next-highest-ranked
 Vendor.

 submitted. Therefore, the proposal should be initially submitted on the most favorable terms the

 matter without obligation to the City.

    The City has the right to:
     • Cancel or re-issue the RFP at any time.
     • Accept the proposal, proposals or parts of a proposal deemed most advantageous to the
        City, or to reject any or all proposals for any cause whatsoever if deemed in the best
        interests of the City.
     • Waive any minor informalities or irregularities contained in any proposal.
     • Amend the RFP in any manner prior to contract award.
     • Reject any proposal which contains false or misleading statements or is not in compliance

     • Obtain clarification of any point in a Proposal. Such clarification may be in any form, such
        as conference calls, email communications, Web demos, onsite demos, vendor
        headquarters visits, or other method of the City’s choosing.
     • Share the RFP, proposals and subsequent vendor-provided information with any consultant
        of the City’s choosing in order to secure expert opinion.
     • Make copies of any Proposals for evaluation purposes or as required for legal and
        regulatory compliance.
     • Record all demos.
     • Request from the software vendor a different implementation partner than the one
        proposed.
     • At the City’s sole discretion, select a different implementation vendor on its own.

    H. REQUIREMENTS RESPONSE FORMAT

     This section includes the expected formatted response to the technical and functional
     requirements to be evaluated in this RFP. The Requirements section is included in Section 2
     of the RFP. While it is a comprehensive list of the City’s requirements, the City reserve the
     right to make changes to these requirements as it learns more about how its needs could be
     better served with the vendor’s responses. Responses to each line item should be concise and
     straightforward.

                               INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING REQUIREMENTS

     For each numbered line item requirement, the vendor must indicate in the “Vendor
     Response” column S, 3P, C, F, or N, according to the following legend:

                      S                     Fully supported by the current release of the
                                            software, vendor to show during demo what
                                            is included in standard reporting
                     3P                     Supported with third party software (i.e.
                                            software not directly owned or controlled by
                                            the vendor submitting the proposal).
                      C                     Customization is required to meet the requirement
                                            (e.g. changes to the underlying code must be made;
                                            a new table must be created; etc.) This causes
                                            additional upgrade work in order to implement new
                                            versions or upgrades.
                      F                     Future functionality: Supported in the next
                                            release of the software.
                      N                     Not supported.

     Place an appropriate  mark or X in the corresponding column for each requirement.

1) If the vendor responds with S, C, or F, the vendor must provide additional information in
    the comments column:

     required, any integration requirements, and the vendor’s relationship with this third
     party. Vendor must also provide a cost estimate for the third party software, and also
     include this as a line item on the Pricing Worksheet in Section 4J.

    For “C”, the vendor must explain the nature and amount of customization required, and
     experience with the same or similar modifications. Vendor must also provide a cost
     estimate for the customization, and also include this as a line item on the Pricing

    For “F”, the vendor must explain the functionality in the new release, the expected

    module(s).

General RFP Information
Documents identified as confidential or proprietary will not be treated as such if public disclosure
laws take precedence.

If the City receives a request for inspection or copying of any such documents provided by a
Vendor in response to this RFP, it will promptly notify the Vendor at the address given in response
to this RFP that it has received such a request. Such notice will inform the Vendor of the date the
City intends to disclose the documents requested and affording the Vendor a reasonable
opportunity to obtain a court order prohibiting or conditioning the release of the documents. The
City assumes no contractual obligation to enforce any exemption.

Any information contained in the proposal that the Vendor desires to claim as proprietary or
confidential, and exempt from disclosure must be clearly designated, including identifying the
page and particular exception(s) from disclosure. The City will try to respect all material identified
by the Vendor as being Proprietary or Confidential, but requests that Vendors be highly selective
of what they mark as Confidential. The City will make a decision predicated upon applicable laws
and can choose to disclose information despite it being marked as confidential or proprietary.

Marking the entire proposal as proprietary or confidential, and therefore, exempt from disclosure
will NOT be accepted or honored and may result in disclosure of the entire proposal or
disqualification of the proposal solely at the discretion of the City.

Documents identified as confidential or proprietary will not be treated as such if public disclosure
laws take precedence, the information is publicly available, the information is already in the City’s
possession, the information is obtained from third parties without restrictions on disclosure or the
information was independently developed without reference to the Confidential information.

H. CONFIDENTIALITY

All information and data furnished to the Proposer by the City, and all other documents to which
the Proposer’s employees have access during the term of the contract, shall be treated as
confidential to the City. Any oral or written disclosure to unauthorized individuals is prohibited.

property of the City.

SECTION 5 – CONTRACT AWARD & EXECUTION


 A. EVALUATION CRITERIA

 The Finance Director, IT Director and other key staff will evaluate the submitted proposals. The
 initial Technical and Functional Evaluation will be based on written responses to this RFP. It is
 important that the responses be clear, concise and complete so that the evaluators can adequately
 understand all aspects of the proposal.

 The evaluators will consider the completeness of the proposal, how well the Vendor complied with
 the response requirements, responsiveness of Vendor to requests, the number and nature of
 exceptions (if any) the Vendor takes to the terms and conditions, the total cost of ownership and
 how well the Vendor's proposed solution meets the needs of the City as described in the Vendor's
 response to each requirement and form.

 As part of the evaluation, the City reserves the right to request additional information, ask for a
 demo (web or in person at City of Snoqualmie), conduct conference calls to review the response,
 or take any other action necessary to perform a thorough and objective evaluation of each
 Vendor’s response. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to conducting customer reference
 checks, visiting Vendor headquarters and reviewing any other information about the Vendor and
 its solution (e.g. performance, viability, technology, mergers and acquisitions, organizational
 changes, litigation, industry analyses, etc.)

 The evaluation process is intended to help the City select the Vendor with the best combination of
 attributes, including but not limited to total cost of ownership, ease-of-use, performance,
 reliability, vision, flexibility, stability, sustainability, Vendor viability and Vendor capacity to
 successfully implement the selected applications. The city will evaluate proposals according to the
 criteria below using weighted voting:

 Each evaluator is given a maximum of five points for each section. Example scoring below in grey:


   Criteria               Ease of                         Training &                      Total

 If there is a tie in the scoring, the City will determine if additional interviews or information is
 needed to make a final decision. The additional information and evaluative measures, if needed,
 will be communicated to the finalists.

General RFP Information
       (f) At the conclusion of the Functionality Test, the City Project Manager will notify the

           or the specific items that the System could not perform.
       (g) The City, at its sole option, may waive any irregularities occurring during the Functionality
           Test.
     3. Remedy for Failed Functionality Test
       (a) In its sole judgment, the City may terminate this Agreement for cause if, during
           Functionality Testing, the Software or Customizations fail to perform as specified in the
           functional requirements or the Software’s supporting documentation.
        (b) In its sole determination, City may exercise any, or all, of the following remedies in lieu of
            termination of this Agreement:
                  1. Vendor shall be given the opportunity to extend the acceptance testing period
                     for up to thirty (30) calendar days to allow the vendor to bring any irregularities
                     into compliance. If after such time the irregularity is not remedied to the City’s
                     sole satisfaction, the City may terminate the Agreement for cause, or;
                  2. If the non-compliant component is hardware which was purchased from the
                     vendor or purchased due to the vendor’s written specifications, the City may
                     require the Vendor to replace the component with one that successfully
                     remedies the irregularity (at no charge to the City), or;
                  3. If the non-compliant component is System Software or Third Party Software, the
                     City may reject the component and remove it from the final award, or;
                  4. At the City’s sole option, notwithstanding (1) through (3) above, the City may
                     relegate the non-compliant component as a Customization to be completed at
                     a mutually agreeable date and subject to the following terms:
                         i. As security to ensure timely completion of a Customization, final payment
                            for the Software licenses and Customizations for the defective or non-
                            conforming software function will be held by the City until all
                            Customizations created under the agreement are accepted by the City.
                        ii. If Customizations created under the agreement ultimately fail to correct
                            the irregularity, and the irregularity materially affects the functionality of
                            the System or materially deviates from the City’s functional requirements,
                            the vendor will forfeit the final payment for the Software and
                            Customizations.

                  5. At the City’s sole option, the City will exercise one, or any combination, of the
                     options as described above. Should the System fail to successfully complete the
                     Functionality Test, the System will be deemed to have failed Acceptance and
                     City will be entitled to a full refund.

    4. Performance Testing
       (a) The purpose of the Performance Test is to confirm that the System performs in a

              vendor, in writing, of either the System’s successful completion of the Performance Test
              or the specific items that the System could not perform.
        (e)   The City, at its sole option, may waive any irregularities occurring during the Performance
              Test.

       (a) In its sole judgment, the City may terminate the agreement for cause if the System fails
           to meet the criteria for success defined above. In its sole determination, the City may
           exercise any, or all, of the following remedies in lieu of termination of this Agreement:
                 1. The vendor shall be given the opportunity to extend the Acceptance Testing
                    period for up to thirty (30) calendar days to allow the vendor to diagnose and
                    correct performance problems that may be caused by the Software or the
                    configuration of the Software, or;
                 2. The vendor shall be given the opportunity to install additional hardware or
                    platform components, at the vendor’s sole expense, at the City to enable the
                    Software to meet the performance requirements specified in the Performance
                    Test, or;
                 3. The vendor shall be given up to thirty (30) days following the diagnosis of any
                    problem related to the Software to correct, at the vendor’s sole expense, the
                    defects in the Software and install these corrections at the City, or;
                 4. The City may conduct the Performance Test again, or;
                 5. At the City’s sole option, the City will exercise one, or any combination, of the
                    options described above. Should the System fail to successfully complete the
                    Performance Test, the System will be deemed to have failed Acceptance and the
                    City will be entitled to a full refund.
