                     3|P age
Request for Proposal—RFP

1. What is an RFP?
   The request for proposal (RFP) is a legally recognized procurement method that permits
   contracting agencies to award a contract to a vendor or respondent based upon the proposal
   that is most advantageous to the contracting agency, price and other factors considered, and
   not solely based upon the lowest price.

2. Services procured through an RFP (Simple RFP compared to Competitive Contracting RFP)
   The RFP method is the most preferred method for awarding contracts for the following
   services:

          Professional Services                 Academic/Operational Services (Contracts less than $40,000)
          Auditing; Accounting                 Instructional Services
          Legal                                Educational Services
          Engineering, Architectural           Professional Development Services
          Medical
          Special Education Related Services (as so designated by the board attorney)

3. What is the basis for an award of contract procured through the RFP process?
   Award of Contract—RFP Evaluative Criteria
   The RFP method is designed to award the contract to the vendor or respondent based upon a
   model evaluation criteria (TMC) which may be found in N.J.A.C. 5:34-4.2 and also as
   recommended by the NJ State Comptroller’s Office with the publication:

                           Best Practices in Awarding Service Contracts (2010)
             Technical Criteria
                  Submission of narrative how firm will provide services; planned
                    approach; measurable results
                  Understanding how services will be provided

            Management Criteria
                Business organization; staffing
                Experience; and
                Knowledge of district

           Cost Criteria
                Fee proposal submission; cost analysis

       The award for an RFP contract does not; I repeat does not have to be given to the
       respondent who submits the lowest price. The evaluative process is designed to award the
       contract to the respondent whose response is most advantageous, price and other factors
       considered and who will provide the highest quality service at a fair and competitive price.



                                                                                                4|P age
   Final Note: Advertising an RFP—Not Required!
   There is no legal requirement to advertise a request for proposal that is not part of the
   Competitive Contracting process. Districts are encouraged to “publicize” each RFP by putting it
   the district’s website in PDF format. RFP’s shall be publicized when the district uses Federal
   Funds. When using the RFP process as part of the Competitive Contracting procurement
   process the district has to advertise pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.5 (a).

Competitive Contracting Procurement Method (Certain Contracts over $40,000)

1. What is the Competitive Contracting procurement method?
   The competitive contracting method of procurement is a legally recognized process that
   permits the contracting agency to procure specialized goods and services, the price which
   exceeds the bid threshold.

   Competitive contracting may only be used in lieu of bidding for the specialized goods and
   services enumerated in N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.1 (a-k) and those noted in Local Finance Notice
   2010-3.

2. Goods and services procured through the Competitive Contracting process
   Some of the examples of goods and services that are permitted are:

                       Proprietary Computer Software for Board Use
                            Student Information Systems
                            Business Office; Human Resources
                            Student Transportation
                       Professional Development Services
                       Educational Consultant Services
                       Instructional Improvement Services
                       Goods and services that are exceptions to bidding—N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-5
                       Other goods and services as approved by the New Jersey Division of Local
                        Government Services

3. What is the basis for an award of contract procured through the Competitive Contracting
   process?      (RFP Required!)

       The contracting agency is mandated pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.4, to use the RFP
       process when procuring goods and services through competitive contracting. The award of
       contract is similar to the RFP award—an evaluative criteria which includes, price and other
       factors considered.

                      Request for Proposal Purpose and Use
Request for Proposal (RFP)—Purpose of RFP
The Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement method is used to procure contracts for services
based upon an evaluative criteria selection process. The district uses the evaluative selection
process that is recommended by the State Comptroller of New Jersey and pursuant to N.J.A.C.
5:34-4.2. This evaluative technical, management and cost criteria selection process permits the
board of education to award a contract for services to the respondent whose response is most
advantageous, price and other factors considered and who will provide the highest quality
service at fair and competitive prices.

The Competitive Contracting process as outlined in N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4 et seq. and N.J.A.C. 5:34-
4.1 et seq., permits school districts to procure specialized services in lieu of bidding. The RFP
method shall be the basis of all Competitive Contracting procurements. (18A:18A-4.4)

Examples of When to Use the Request for Proposal (RFP) and Competitive Contracting Process

Activity                                     Amount                Procurement Method
Academic Services (Local/State Funds)*       $6,000-$39,999        RFP or Quotation

       Instructional Improvement
       Educational Consultant
       Professional Development
*Contracts with NJ state colleges, school districts, and government agencies (when using local
state funds) do not require RFP procurement. A written proposal from the school or agency will
suffice, yet competition through the RFP is preferred.


Activity                                     Amount                Procurement Method
Academic Services (Federal Funds) **         $3,500-$39,999        RFP or Quotation

       Instructional Improvement
       Educational Consultant
       Professional Development

Professional Services
The following services are typical “safe” examples of professional services**
       Legal                                SPED Related Services (Board Attorney Guidance)
       Auditing; Accounting                 Medical evaluations
       Architectural; Engineering           Physician; nursing; medical

When using federal funds for the procurement of professional services, it is recommended to
use the Competitive Contracting model pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.1-et seq., when the
amount exceeds the bid threshold of $40,000.

Other Services—when using state and local funds. Please refer to Academic Services—Federal
Funds amounts when using federal funds.
                                          Amount                 Procurement Method
       Recreational/Social Services       $6,000-$39,999         RFP or Quotation
                                          $40,000 or more        Competitive Contracting

       Computer Software (Proprietary)      $6,000-$39,999         RFP or Quotation

The purchase of the proprietary software is for board of education purposes, not academic
purposes. A good example of this would be student information systems, Business Office
financial systems.




Starting the Request for Proposal (RFP) Process—Appointment—School Business
Administrator
It is recommended that administrators who need to procure services through the RFP or
Competitive Contracting process are to contact the School Business Administrator/Board
Secretary for an appointment. The SBA will review the process so that the administrator has a
firm understanding of the process.

Preparation of the RFP
It is recommended that administrators will prepare, with guidance from the School Business
Administrator, the technical specifications of the RFP. The following pages describe the
requirements and timelines of an RFP.




                                                                                      8|P age

   sources for the presentation package:

                 NJ State Comptroller—Best Practices for Awarding Services Contracts (2010)
                 N.J.A.C. 5:34-4.2.
   The State Comptroller recommends that all proposals be judged on the basis of pre-determined,
   merit-based evaluative criteria, made known to the vendors before proposals are submitted to the
   district. The recommended criteria are found in N.J.A.C. 5:34-4.2.:

                    I. Technical Criteria
                  II. Management Criteria
                 III. Cost Criteria

       The section highlighted in yellow is not to be put in the RFP document. It only serves as
       guidance for the preparation of the RFP.

   5:34-4.2 Model Evaluation Criteria

   The following, as appropriate to individual circumstances, shall be used as criteria for evaluating
   requests for proposals (RFPs) under the competitive contracting process described in N.J.S.A.
   40A:11-4.1 et seq. and 18A:18A-4.1 et seq. These criteria are not intended to be limiting or all-
   inclusive, and they may be adapted or supplemented in order to meet a contracting unit's
   individual needs as competitive contracting may dictate. No criteria shall unfairly or illegally
   discriminate or exclude otherwise capable vendors.




                                                                                               14 | P a g e

                Expenses Not Related to the Contract; District Procedures
                 There may be a circumstance where a request is made for the respondent to
                 provide services not directly related to the contract. These services not related to
                 the contract are not to be provided by the respondent unless so approved in
                 writing by the school district or the district may procure the services requested
                 through a competitive process.

                Extraordinary Expenses
                 Extraordinary expenses to be incurred by the respondent in the performance of
                 his/her duties may be brought to the Board prior to the actual expenditure. The
                 Board, upon recommendation of the appropriate administrator, may consider
                 reimbursing the expense, or the Board may procure the services separately.

H. Evaluation Process –Methodology of Awarding Contracts
   The State Comptroller recommends the following:
              Weighting of criteria should be used with some criteria to be determined more
               important than others.
              Scoring and evaluation process should be well documented.

   You are required to prepare an Evaluation Scoring Sheet assigning points to the criteria based upon
   importance. This form is to be based upon a value of one hundred (100) points.

                                                                                             18 | P a g e

     Assigning Points to Criteria and Evaluation Rubric

     The district is to assign points based upon the relative importance of each criteria. The district may
     also prepare and attach to the RFP, an Evaluation Rubric which may offer in more detail the
     evaluation and scoring process.

I.   Evaluation of Proposals – School Business Administrator/Evaluation Committee
     A committee may be appointed by the School Business Administrator to assist him/her in the
     evaluation of proposals that have been submitted. Committee members shall be familiar with
     the need for services to be performed in the request for proposal. For Competitive Contracting
     proposals, the School Business Administrator shall prepare a report evaluating and
     recommending the award of contract. N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.5 (d).

     Committee members will be identified in the final report submitted to the board and also in
     the award of contract resolution.

J. Presentations and Interviews—Negotiations Not Permitted
     The Board of Education may at its option, require respondents of its choice to attend interviews
     and make presentations to district officials as to clarification regarding their submission. This
     process may only take place after proposals have been opened and reviewed and prior to the
     completion of the evaluation. Under no circumstances shall the provisions of the proposal be
     subject to negotiation—N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.5 (b)


K. Award of Contract—Report/Recommendation of School Business Administrator; Multiple
   Awards

     The School Business Administrator shall evaluate all proposal received. After the proposals have
     been evaluated, the School Business Administrator shall prepare a report, evaluating and
     recommending the award of contract. N.J.S.A. 18A-18A-4.5 (d)

     It is the intention of the Board of Education to award the contract, based upon the report and
     recommendation of the School Business Administrator, to the respondent whose response is
     the most advantageous to the board, price and other factors considered, and who will provide
     the highest quality service at fair and competitive prices.

                                                                                              19 | P a g e
   The Board, based upon the report of the School Business Administrator, may award contracts
   to one or more vendors based upon availability of vendors to provide services and other
   factors.

L. Packaging/Submission of Proposal—Form of Submission (See checklist—Form of Submission)

   The board requests that all proposals be placed in a sealed package, with one (1) proposal
   clearly marked “Original Proposal” and with one (1) clearly marked “Copy.”

   Flash Drive
   The board requires that the proposal be presented on one (1) electronic flash drive as well as the
   original proposal and one copy of the proposal.

RE:            Evaluation Committee for Request for Proposals—RFP’s


I am providing to you as an attachment a copy of a document issued by The Office of the State
Comptroller entitled

                         Best Practices for Awarding Service Contracts

The guidelines were issued by the State Comptroller in March 2010 and have become standards
when issuing and evaluating proposals for services procured through the RFP process. Pursuant
to N.J.A.C. 5:34-4.3 I (2), the School Business Administrator may appoint a committee to assist
the SBA in the evaluation of the proposals. If there is a committee to be appointed the following
guidance shall prevail:

The Need for an Evaluation Committee
The State Comptroller recommends that all proposals received should be judged by an evaluation
committee and that the evaluators must be “qualified to judge” and must “avoid a conflict of
interest” as it pertains to the proposal.

   A. Qualified to Judge
You will note by reading the guidelines, the State Comptroller recommends that all committee
members be sufficiently qualified to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposals.
Furthermore, the evaluation committee must have “the relevant experience necessary to evaluate
the project” and “committee members are to be familiar with the services to be performed in the
request of the proposal.” Finally, the guidelines state the committee should have the “appropriate
expertise concerning the subject of procurement.”

Adhering to the State Comptroller’s Guidelines I am asking the following:
        Names of Committee Members
All Administrators requesting services through the RFP process must provide to my office a list
of names of those people who I may select to be on the evaluation committee. To be in good
faith compliance with the guidelines, proposals no longer can be evaluated by one person.




                                                                                        26 | P a g e
        Evaluation Training, Scoring Procedures and Recommendations
     I will provide to all committee members a review of the State Comptroller’s requirements as
     it pertains to evaluating the proposal, scoring the proposals and preparing recommendations
     to the board of education. I will also be a member of every evaluation committee and certify
     the responses as it pertains to the procurement process and will offer assistance in the
     evaluation of the cost criteria.

     B. Avoid a Conflict of Interest
     You will note that the State Comptroller recommends that all evaluators be “truly impartial
     arbiters” and that the evaluators shall have no personal interest financial or familial with any
     of the contract vendors or principals to be evaluated. The Comptroller recommends in
     accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:34-4.3(f) to have all members of the evaluation committee
     certify there are no conflicts of interest.

     I will provide to all members of the evaluation committee a Conflict of Interest Certification
     See attached Certification of No Conflict of Interest form.

Using a Scoring Process
The State Comptroller suggests that the procurement officer provide to each committee member
a “short written description of the process to be used in scoring all proposals.” Please refer to
pages 19-22 for the guidelines for scoring. These pages will become part of each memo for each
RFP to be evaluated and the processes outlined should be followed and be well documented.
See attached individual Scoring Sheets for each respondent.

Important – Scoring of Proposals
The State Comptroller offers the following guidance for the scoring process:
The Scoring process and award recommendations should be well documented and retained.
    Every step in the evaluative process should be documented through
       a. scoring sheets;
       b. written record of what transpired during any permitted negotiations between vendors and
           procurement officials;
       c. written comparative analysis of competing proposals; and
       d. written award recommendation.

a.   The written award recommendation should
       a. explain the factors that led to the award decision;
       b. offer qualitative discussion of the leading competing proposals; and
       c. describe the specific characteristics of the winning vendor’s proposal that resulted in its
           selection over the others.

See attached Award Report Template sheets.




                                                                                           27 | P a g e
                        Scoring of Proposals – Model Guidance


Scoring of Evaluations— Technical Criteria Guidance
Applying numerical scores to the evaluation criteria is a very subjective process. The Office of
the School Business Administrator provides guidance on the technical criteria scoring process:


                                   Technical Criteria—30 Points

Sample of Cost Evaluation—To Be Completed by the School Business Administrator

Cost Evaluation—Formula
Cost points should be calculated as follows:

Establish lowest cost submitted – lowest cost submitted receives the maximum points. To
assign points to all others, the following formula should be followed:
Lowest Cost Submitted  Cost Submitted x Maximum Possible Cost Points = Cost Points to
Award (see example below).

               Formula                              Sample           Sample       Sample
       Lowest Cost Submitted                       $100,000         $100,000     $100,000
      Cost Submitted                              $100,000         $200,000     $150,000
x      Maximum Possible Cost Points                   40               40           40
=      Points To Award                                40               20          26.7

Formula Example—based upon 30 points for Cost Criterion

    A. Ranking of Costs Submitted—District received four (4) proposals
       Rank all costs in order from lowest to highest cost

              A       $30,000
              B       $33,000
              C       $37,000
              D       $42,000

    B. Note the Number of Points Assigned to Cost

                      Cost Criteria 30 points

    C. Use Formula to Calculate Number of Points for Each Response

              Formula

              Lowest Cost Submitted                           $30,000
                     Divided by
              Cost Submitted                                  $33,000
                     Times
              Maximum Possible Points                         30 points

       Vendor A       $30,000        30 points
       Vendor B       $33,000        27.3 points
       Vendor C       $37,000        24.3 points
       Vendor D       $42,000        21.3 points

         B    $30,000 divided by $33,000 times 30 = 27.3 points
         C    $30,000 divided by $37,000 times 30 = 24.3 points
         D    $30,000 divided by $42,000 times 30 = 21.3 points

                                                                                  30 | P a g e

The project estimate amount is what you feel the project will cost in its entirety or the maximum
labor hour cost to be charged for the project. If RFPs received for this project substantially
exceed the estimate costs the Board may reject all RFPs.

Resolution Approving Professional Service Contract – Speech Therapy and
Evaluations, CC-03-14 – (continued)

Selection of Vendor
The vendors selected have provided services to the district in the past and were the
highest in receiving award points by the panel of reviewers. Although the
recommended vendors did not propose the lowest fee schedule, their satisfactory
experience and the narrowness of difference in rates per hour for therapy, gave
confidence to their selection as the agencies to provide speech services for the 2013-
2014 school year. The selection of multiple vendors provides choice of assignments so as to
have different vendors provide the evaluations and the therapy to the greatest extent possible.

       The term of contract will be from July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014.


Total estimated contract amounts as follows:
   Kid Clan -                             Contract not to exceed      $1,650,000.00
   Kid Clan Nonpublic Schools             Contract not to exceed      $ 150,000.00

                            Methods of Procurement

The Public School Contracts Law and supporting administrative code have
provided to school districts, various methods of procurement to use for the
purchase of goods and services for our schools. Among the major ones are:

      Advertising for Bids                   N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4 (a)
      Solicitation of Quotations             N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-37 (a)
      Competitive Contracting                N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.1
      Extraordinary Unspecifiable Services   N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-37 (b)

Another major procurement method is the Request for Proposal (RFP).

                       The Request for Proposal (RFP)

The Request for Proposal (RFP) is supported for use as a procurement method as
follows:

Procurement of Professional Services—Part I
The use of the RFP procurement method for professional services is supported by
N.J.A.C. 6A:23A-5.2 (a) (5).

“Professional services contracts are issued in a deliberative and efficient manner
that ensures the district receives the highest quality services at a fair and
competitive price or through a shared service arrangement. This may include, but
is not limited to, issuance of such contracts through a request for proposals (RFP)
based on cost and other specified factors or other comparable process.”

Procurement of Professional Services—Part II
The use of the Request for Proposal procurement method for to purchase
professional services is further supported by N.J.A.C. 6A:23A-9.3 (c) (11).

“The district solicits competitive proposals with fee quotes or uses a comparable
process to ensure the district receives the highest quality services at a fair and
competitive price prior to the award of contracts for professional services.”




                                                                              68 | P a g e
Specialized Goods and Services—Competitive Contracting
School districts may use another procurement method when purchasing
specialized goods and services as listed in N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.1. This method is
called the Competitive Contracting process.

School districts using the Competitive Contracting process

      “…shall utilize a request for proposal documentation…”

         Reference—N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.4 and N.J.A.C. 5:34-4.2 and 4.3

It appears, therefore, that the State of New Jersey has authorized the use of the
Request for Proposal (RFP) process for the procurement of certain specialized
goods and services, including professional services.

It also appears that school districts have to provide documentation during their
budget review that they solicited competitive proposals or used a comparable
process in the award of professional services contracts.

Final Note:

Procuring Goods and Services with Federal Funds
When procuring goods and services through federal funds with the desire to
award the contract based upon the proposal that is most advantageous, price and
other factors considered, the contracting agency is to comply with the Uniform
Grant Guidance

         2CFR 200.320 (d) Procurement by Competitive Proposals




                                                                           69 | P a g e

                              The Possible Misuse

Advertising for Bidding—the Standard!
The State of New Jersey has clearly outlined in N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4 (a) the
following:

“Every contract for the provision or performance of any goods or services, the cost
of which in the aggregate exceeds the bid threshold, shall be awarded only by
resolution of the board of education to the lowest responsible bidder after public
advertising for bids and bidding therefor, except as is provided otherwise in this
chapter or specifically by any other law.”

It is noted that the State of New Jersey has highlighted that every contract that
exceeds the bid threshold shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder after
public advertising for bids and bidding.

Exceptions
The State of New Jersey has provided an exception clause if you want to use
another procurement method.

So, it appears that you either bid or use another procurement method recognized
by law when purchasing goods and services.

Guidance on the Misuse of the RFP Method
It appears that certain school districts are using the RFP method for procuring
certain goods and services, when they should have gone out to bid instead for
those particular goods and services. Please seek legal guidance if you want to use
the Request for Proposal (RFP) method for goods or services other than
professional services or those goods and services listed in N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.1.




                                                                             70 | P a g e
                       The Request for Qualifications--RFQ

A word about the RFQ—Request for Qualifications!
Another method that has appeared on the procurement scene is called the RFQ—
Request for Qualifications. The NJ Division of Local Government Services has
recognized this procurement type in Local Finance Notice 2007-11 page 4

Request for Qualifications—RFQ
“Using this model, a Board can specify the desired qualifications, establish criteria
for, and award open-ended contracts (for terms as allowed by law) based on those
proposals, which may or may not include pricing proposals. Orders for specific
services would then be placed as needed with individual contractors based on
price quotations, ability, or availability of specific goods or services. An RFQ does
not require an evaluation based on price – it can be based on skills, ability to
deliver a certain product, or range and breadth of a product line – with price being
agreed upon at the end of the evaluation process.”

Proceed with Caution—When Using the RFQ Method
A stated earlier, to be in compliance with N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4 (a), it appears that
you either bid or use another procurement method recognized by law when
purchasing goods and services.

I have found no evidence of the RFQ method in the Public School Contracts Law or
supporting administrative code. If you intend to use the RFQ method, please
obtain an opinion from your board attorney.

            Preparing Board of Education Resolutions
           for Awarding Contracts - Goods and Services


Preface
It will be universally agreed upon by all board members, all superintendents of
schools and even many school business administrators that extensive, wordy
board resolutions are not in the best interests in conducting an efficient board
meeting.

Many school districts follow the course of providing to the board members an
agenda listing the items and backup supporting materials. This is fine,
however, certain board resolutions for the award of certain contracts for
goods and services, require by law, certain information to be included in the
resolution.

Guidance on how to prepare of resolutions for awarding contracts is provided
as follows:

A. Award of Contracts-Bids-N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-21 (b)
   It is noted in this citation that
 "A proper record of the prices and terms shall be made in the minutes of the
board.”
It appears that it would be in the best interests of the district to list all of the
vendors who submitted bids and include their prices for all of the items they on
which they bid. The award of contract resolution should have all bid prices from
all bidders, and not solely mention the winning bidder.

Extreme Resolution-Athletic Equipment and Supplies Bid
Yes, in Passaic I had an Athletic Equipment and Supplies bid that requested
prices for over 175 different items. There were ten (10) bidders who submitted
prices. The spread sheet was outrageous, however, every price from every
bidder made the agenda and was included in the board minutes.


                                                                             73 | P a g e
B. Award of Transportation Contracts-N.J.A.C. 6A:27-9.10 (a) (1)

   It is noted in this citation that the board minutes authorizing the award
   of contracts shall include the following:

           Contractor's name
           Route numbers
           Individual costs of all bidders who submitted bids

C. Award of Competitive Contracting Contracts-N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.5 (d)

   It is noted in letter (d) of the law that the Purchasing Agent shall
   prepare a report evaluating and recommending an award of contract.

   The report at a minimum shall

      List the names of all those vendors who submitted proposals;
      Summarize each proposal submitted;
      Rank vendors in order of evaluation;
      Provide reasons for the award; and
    Detail the terms, conditions, scope of service, fees and other
     matters.

It is further noted in N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.5 (f), that the aforementioned report
shall become part of the public record and shall reflect the final action of
the board.

Public Record of an Action of the Board
I think your board attorney will agree with me, that the public record of an action
of the board would be recorded in the board minutes, ergo, the resolution for
the contract award for Competitive Contracting should have at least the
minimum items mentioned in N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-4.5 (d).




                                                                           74 | P a g e
D. Award of Contracts—Professional Services-N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-5 (a) (1)

   It is noted in the above citation, that boards of education, in awarding
   contracts for professional services, shall state in each instance, the supporting
   reasons for its actions in the board resolution.

   School Business Administrators are encouraged to provide reasons for
   awarding professional services contracts in each board resolution.

E. Award of Contracts-Proprietary Purchases—N.J.A.C. 5:34-9.1 (c)

   It is noted in the above citation that board resolutions awarding contracts
   through the “proprietary bid” process, shall include a description of why the
   goods and services are specialized in nature and necessary for the conduct of
   the affairs of the board. Reference N.J.A.C. 5:34-9.1 (a) (1) (2).

   School Business Administrators are encouraged to provide the compelling
   reasons for the purchase of proprietary goods or services.

F. Award of Contract—Extraordinary Unspecifiable Services-N.J.S.A. 18A:18A-5
   (2)

   It is noted in the above citation that boards of education, in awarding
   contracts for Extraordinary Unspecifiable Services (EUS), shall state in each
   instance, the supporting reasons for its action in the board resolution.

   School Business Administrators are encouraged to provide reasons for
   awarding EUS contracts in each board resolution.
