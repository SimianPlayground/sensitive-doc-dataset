        Pomona College Interest-Free Loan Application Form
Students may borrow to cover the expected family contribution or to pay for books and other educational expenses. In
addition to Federal Loan options, Pomona College offers private, institutional loans to help meet your family's share of
college expenses. While these institutional loans have a 0% interest rate, there are also restrictions to the loan program:
          1. Students must be full time and in good academic standing (grade average of C/6.0).
          2. Students may not borrow more than $5,000 or the total of their family contribution - whichever is less. (The
             maximum loan amount is set annually and may vary in future years.)

We require students to submit an application for financial aid so that our office may determine if you are eligible for need-
based grant assistance. Please review our application procedures and requirements on our website:
https://www.pomona.edu/financial-aid

Students that have been approved to borrow an institutional loan will need to complete a Master Promissory Note along
with loan application documents in order to be in compliance with Regulation Z of the Truth in Lending act (TILA). These
documents will be provided by Educational Computer Systems, Inc. (ECSI) on behalf of the Office of Financial Aid.
Approved students will receive an e-mail notification from ECSI when the documents may be completed online.

           To request or change your loan, please provide the information below and return this form to our office
