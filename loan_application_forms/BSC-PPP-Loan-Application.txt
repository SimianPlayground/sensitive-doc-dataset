 Purpose of this form:

 This form is to be completed by the authorized representative of the Applicant and submitted to your SBA Participating Lender. Submission of
 the requested information is required to make a determination regarding eligibility for financial assistance. Failure to submit the information
 would affect that determination.

 Instructions for completing this form:

 With respect to “purpose of the loan,” payroll costs consist of compensation to employees (whose principal place of residence is the United
 States) in the form of salary, wages, commissions, or similar compensation; cash tips or the equivalent (based on employer records of past tips
 or, in the absence of such records, a reasonable, good-faith employer estimate of such tips); payment for vacation, parental, family, medical, or
 sick leave; allowance for separation or dismissal; payment for the provision of employee benefits consisting of group health care coverage,
 including insurance premiums, and retirement; payment of state and local taxes assessed on compensation of employees; and for an
 independent contractor or sole proprietor, wage, commissions, income, or net earnings from self-employment or similar compensation.

 For purposes of calculating “Average Monthly Payroll,” most Applicants will use the average monthly payroll for 2019, excluding costs over
 $100,000 on an annualized basis for each employee. For seasonal businesses, the Applicant may elect to instead use average monthly payroll
 for the time period between February 15, 2019 and June 30, 2019, excluding costs over $100,000 on an annualized basis for each employee.
 For new businesses, average monthly payroll may be calculated using the time period from January 1, 2020 to February 29, 2020, excluding
 costs over $100,000 on an annualized basis for each employee.

 If Applicant is refinancing an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL): Add the outstanding amount of an EIDL made between January 31, 2020
 and April 3, 2020, less the amount of any “advance” under an EIDL COVID-19 loan, to Loan Request as indicated on the form.

 All parties listed below are considered owners of the Applicant as defined in 13 CFR § 120.10, as well as “principals”:

    For a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor;
    For a partnership, all general partners, and all limited partners owning 20% or more of the equity of the firm;
    For a corporation, all owners of 20% or more of the corporation;
    For limited liability companies, all members owning 20% or more of the company; and
    Any Trustor (if the Applicant is owned by a trust).
  Paperwork Reduction Act – You are not required to respond to this collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB
  Control Number. The estimated time for completing this application, including gathering data needed, is 8 minutes. Comments about this time
  or the information requested should be sent to : Small Business Administration, Director, Records Management Division, 409 3rd St., SW,
  Washington DC 20416., and/or SBA Desk Officer, Office of Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, Washington DC
  20503.
  Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) – Under the provisions of the Privacy Act, you are not required to provide your social security number. Failure to
  provide your social security number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to which you are entitled. (But see Debt Collection Notice
  regarding taxpayer identification number below.) Disclosures of name and other personal identifiers are required to provide SBA with
  sufficient information to make a character determination. When evaluating character, SBA considers the person’s integrity, candor, and
  disposition toward criminal actions. Additionally, SBA is specifically authorized to verify your criminal history, or lack thereof, pursuant to
  section 7(a)(1)(B), 15 USC Section 636(a)(1)(B) of the Small Business Act (the Act).

  Disclosure of Information – Requests for information about another party may be denied unless SBA has the written permission of the
  individual to release the information to the requestor or unless the information is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.
  The Privacy Act authorizes SBA to make certain “routine uses” of information protected by that Act. One such routine use is the disclosure of
  information maintained in SBA’s system of records when this information indicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil,
  criminal, or administrative in nature. Specifically, SBA may refer the information to the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local or
  foreign, charged with responsibility for, or otherwise involved in investigation, prosecution, enforcement or prevention of such violations.
  Another routine use is disclosure to other Federal agencies conducting background checks but only to the extent the information is relevant to
  the requesting agencies' function. See, 74 F.R. 14890 (2009), and as amended from time to time for additional background and other routine
  uses. In addition, the CARES Act, requires SBA to register every loan made under the Paycheck Protection Act using the Taxpayer
  Identification Number (TIN) assigned to the borrower.
  Debt Collection Act of 1982, Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq. and other titles) – SBA must obtain your taxpayer
  identification number when you apply for a loan. If you receive a loan, and do not make payments as they come due, SBA may: (1) report the
  status of your loan(s) to credit bureaus, (2) hire a collection agency to collect your loan, (3) offset your income tax refund or other amounts
  due to you from the Federal Government, (4) suspend or debar you or your company from doing business with the Federal Government, (5)
  refer your loan to the Department of Justice, or (6) foreclose on collateral or take other action permitted in the loan instruments.
  Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3401) – The Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, grants SBA access rights to
  financial records held by financial institutions that are or have been doing business with you or your business including any financial

                                                                         3

  institutions participating in a loan or loan guaranty. SBA is only required provide a certificate of its compliance with the Act to a financial
  institution in connection with its first request for access to your financial records. SBA's access rights continue for the term of any approved
  loan guaranty agreement. SBA is also authorized to transfer to another Government authority any financial records concerning an approved
  loan or loan guarantee, as necessary to process, service or foreclose on a loan guaranty or collect on a defaulted loan guaranty.
  Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) – Subject to certain exceptions, SBA must supply information reflected in agency files and
  records to a person requesting it. Information about approved loans that will be automatically released includes, among other things, statistics
  on our loan programs (individual borrowers are not identified in the statistics) and other information such as the names of the borrowers (and
  their officers, directors, stockholders or partners), the collateral pledged to secure the loan, the amount of the loan, its purpose in general terms
  and the maturity. Proprietary data on a borrower would not routinely be made available to third parties. All requests under this Act are to be
  addressed to the nearest SBA office and be identified as a Freedom of Information request.
  Occupational Safety and Health Act (15 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) – The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) can require
  businesses to modify facilities and procedures to protect employees. Businesses that do not comply may be fined, forced to cease operations,
  or prevented from starting operations. Signing this form is certification that the applicant, to the best of its knowledge, is in compliance with
  the applicable OSHA requirements, and will remain in compliance during the life of the loan.
  Civil Rights (13 C.F.R. 112, 113, 117) – All businesses receiving SBA financial assistance must agree not to discriminate in any business
  practice, including employment practices and services to the public on the basis of categories cited in 13 C.F.R., Parts 112, 113, and 117 of
  SBA Regulations. All borrowers must display the "Equal Employment Opportunity Poster" prescribed by SBA.
  Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691) – Creditors are prohibited from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race,
  color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all
  or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right
  under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
  Debarment and Suspension Executive Order 12549; (2 CFR Part 180 and Part 2700) – By submitting this loan application, you certify
  that neither the Applicant or any owner of the Applicant have within the past three years been: (a) debarred, suspended, declared ineligible or
  voluntarily excluded from participation in a transaction by any Federal Agency; (b) formally proposed for debarment, with a final
  determination still pending; (c) indicted, convicted, or had a civil judgment rendered against you for any of the offenses listed in the
  regulations or (d) delinquent on any amounts owed to the U.S. Government or its instrumentalities as of the date of execution of this
  certification.

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM (PPP)
INFORMATION SHEET: BORROWERS


The Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) authorizes up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to
small businesses to pay their employees during the COVID-19 crisis. All loan terms will be the
same for everyone.
The loan amounts will be forgiven as long as:

    •   The loan proceeds are used to cover payroll costs, and most mortgage interest, rent, and
        utility costs over the 8 week period after the loan is made; and
    •   Employee and compensation levels are maintained.

Payroll costs are capped at $100,000 on an annualized basis for each employee. Due to likely
high subscription, it is anticipated that not more than 25% of the forgiven amount may be for
non-payroll costs.
Loan payments will be deferred for 6 months.
When can I apply?

    •   Starting April 3, 2020, small businesses and sole proprietorships can apply for and
        receive loans to cover their payroll and other certain expenses through existing SBA
        lenders.
    •   Starting April 10, 2020, independent contractors and self-employed individuals can
        apply for and receive loans to cover their payroll and other certain expenses through
        existing SBA lenders.
    •   Other regulated lenders will be available to make these loans as soon as they are
        approved and enrolled in the program.

Where can I apply? You can apply through any existing SBA lender or through any federally
insured depository institution, federally insured credit union, and Farm Credit System institution
that is participating. Other regulated lenders will be available to make these loans once they are
approved and enrolled in the program. You should consult with your local lender as to whether it
is participating. Visit www.sba.gov for a list of SBA lenders.
Who can apply? All businesses – including nonprofits, veterans organizations, Tribal business
concerns, sole proprietorships, self-employed individuals, and independent contractors – with 500
or fewer employees can apply. Businesses in certain industries can have more than 500
employees if they meet applicable SBA employee-based size standards for those industries (click
HERE for additional detail).
For this program, the SBA’s affiliation standards are waived for small businesses (1) in the hotel
and food services industries (click HERE for NAICS code 72 to confirm); or (2) that are franchises
in the SBA’s Franchise Directory (click HERE to check); or (3) that receive financial assistance from
small business investment companies licensed by the SBA. Additional guidance may be released as
appropriate.
What do I need to apply? You will need to complete the Paycheck Protection Program loan
application and submit the application with the required documentation to an approved lender
that is available to process your application by June 30, 2020. Click HERE for the application.
What other documents will I need to include in my application? You will need to provide your
lender with payroll documentation.
Do I need to first look for other funds before applying to this program? No. We are waiving the
usual SBA requirement that you try to obtain some or all of the loan funds from other sources (i.e.,
we are waiving the Credit Elsewhere requirement).
How long will this program last? Although the program is open until June 30, 2020, we encourage
you to apply as quickly as you can because there is a funding cap and lenders need time to
process your loan.
How many loans can I take out under this program? Only one.
What can I use these loans for? You should use the proceeds from these loans on your:

    •   Payroll costs, including benefits;
    •   Interest on mortgage obligations, incurred before February 15, 2020;
    •   Rent, under lease agreements in force before February 15, 2020; and
    •   Utilities, for which service began before February 15, 2020.

What counts as payroll costs? Payroll costs include:

    •   Salary, wages, commissions, or tips (capped at $100,000 on an annualized basis for each
        employee);
    •   Employee benefits including costs for vacation, parental, family, medical, or sick leave;
        allowance for separation or dismissal; payments required for the provisions of group
        health care benefits including insurance premiums; and payment of any retirement benefit;
    •   State and local taxes assessed on compensation; and
    •   For a sole proprietor or independent contractor: wages, commissions, income, or net
        earnings from self-employment, capped at $100,000 on an annualized basis for each
        employee.

How large can my loan be? Loans can be for up to two months of your average monthly payroll
costs from the last year plus an additional 25% of that amount. That amount is subject to a $10
million cap. If you are a seasonal or new business, you will use different applicable time periods
for your calculation. Payroll costs will be capped at $100,000 annualized for each employee.
How much of my loan will be forgiven? You will owe money when your loan is due if you use the
loan amount for anything other than payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent, and utilities payments
over the 8 weeks after getting the loan. Due to likely high subscription, it is anticipated that not
more than 25% of the forgiven amount may be for non-payroll costs.
You will also owe money if you do not maintain your staff and payroll.
    •   Number of Staff: Your loan forgiveness will be reduced if you decrease your full-time
        employee headcount.
    •   Level of Payroll: Your loan forgiveness will also be reduced if you decrease salaries and
        wages by more than 25% for any employee that made less than $100,000 annualized in
        2019.
    •   Re-Hiring: You have until June 30, 2020 to restore your full-time employment and salary
        levels for any changes made between February 15, 2020 and April 26, 2020.
How can I request loan forgiveness? You can submit a request to the lender that is servicing the
loan. The request will include documents that verify the number of full-time equivalent
employees and pay rates, as well as the payments on eligible mortgage, lease, and utility
obligations. You must certify that the documents are true and that you used the forgiveness
amount to keep employees and make eligible mortgage interest, rent, and utility payments. The
lender must make a decision on the forgiveness within 60 days.
What is my interest rate? 1.00% fixed rate.
When do I need to start paying interest on my loan? All payments are deferred for 6 months;
however, interest will continue to accrue over this period.
When is my loan due? In 2 years.
Can I pay my loan earlier than 2 years? Yes. There are no prepayment penalties or fees.
Do I need to pledge any collateral for these loans? No. No collateral is required.
Do I need to personally guarantee this loan? No. There is no personal guarantee requirement.
***However, if the proceeds are used for fraudulent purposes, the U.S. government will pursue
criminal charges against you.***
What do I need to certify? As part of your application, you need to certify in good faith that:

    •   Current economic uncertainty makes the loan necessary to support your ongoing
        operations.
    •   The funds will be used to retain workers and maintain payroll or to make mortgage, lease,
        and utility payments.
    •   You have not and will not receive another loan under this program.
    •   You will provide to the lender documentation that verifies the number of full-time
        equivalent employees on payroll and the dollar amounts of payroll costs, covered
        mortgage interest payments, covered rent payments, and covered utilities for the eight
        weeks after getting this loan.
    •   Loan forgiveness will be provided for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered
        mortgage interest payments, covered rent payments, and covered utilities. Due to likely
        high subscription, it is anticipated that not more than 25% of the forgiven amount may be
        for non-payroll costs.
    •   All the information you provided in your application and in all supporting documents and
        forms is true and accurate. Knowingly making a false statement to get a loan under this
        program is punishable by law.
•   You acknowledge that the lender will calculate the eligible loan amount using the tax
    documents you submitted. You affirm that the tax documents are identical to those you
    submitted to the IRS. And you also understand, acknowledge, and agree that the lender
    can share the tax information with the SBA’s authorized representatives, including
    authorized representatives of the SBA Office of Inspector General, for the purpose of
    compliance with SBA Loan Program Requirements and all SBA reviews.
