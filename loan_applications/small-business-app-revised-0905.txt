Dear Small Business Applicant:

Thank you for contacting Self-Help about a loan for your small business. We look forward to
working with you to find financing that best meets your needs. To make this process easier,
please take time to read the following information about the application process.

What forms do I submit to apply for a loan?
A checklist of items you need to submit to us is on page 2 of this package. Most of the forms you
need to submit to us are in the pages attached to this letter. A few items we will need, such as
your tax returns, are not forms in this package. Just follow the checklist and you’ll stay
organized.

What do I do when I have my application package completed?
Please mail or deliver your completed application package to the loan officer listed on the
business card with this package. This is who will work with you on your application. (If there is
not a business card enclosed, then please call the nearest Self-Help branch and ask for the loan
officer’s name.)

What should I make sure not to forget?
Sign all forms where indicated. The items requiring your signature include the personal financial
statement, the commercial loan application form, and your tax returns. Also, before you mail
your completed loan application package to us, make a copy of the application package to keep
for yourself. We keep all application materials sent to us and cannot return submitted forms.

CAN GOING “GREEN” PUT MORE GREEN IN YOUR POCKET?
                    A WORD FROM OUR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE

Change Once, Save Every Month
Businesses and nonprofits often throw away hard-earned money through inefficient lighting, poor
insulation, water and material waste, and poorly maintained air conditioners/heaters. Instead of
profits for you, this money goes to utility companies, waste haulers and material suppliers.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Some solutions are free and simple. Others require an upfront
investment that pays back over time. By choosing to address these money-wasters today, you may
realize significant cost savings that will extend far into the future.

Common Ways Businesses Can Save
                     Heating/AC: Cleaning filters and heat-transfer coils can reduce energy
                     expenses. Window shades or awnings and strategically-planted trees can
                     produce big savings on air conditioning. Programmable thermostats are
                     another important energy saver. Caulking windows and doors, installing
                     storm windows and doors, and adding insulation may save on heating costs.

                     Lighting: Traditional bulbs and ballasts can be replaced with energy efficient
                     ones. Daylighting, room occupancy sensors, and task lighting can get quality
                     light where it is needed and reduce over-lighting.

                     Water: Quickly repairing leaky plumbing and putting faucet aerators on sinks
                     can reduce your water bill. EnergyStar water heaters save energy. Large
                     water users may want to consider preheating water with solar hot water
                     heaters. Drought-tolerant landscaping is another idea.
                     Office Settings: Consider EnergyStar computers and copiers; double-sided
                     printing; washable kitchenware rather than Styrofoam/plastic; refillable toner
                     cartridges; and paper and aluminum can recycling. Plants and non-toxic
                     cleaners help to keep the air clean and workers productive.



What Should I Do Next?

professional. Visit the websites on the back of this page for more details and contacts.

Self-Help is happy to discuss financing these improvements. Talk to your loan officer about your
options. Want more information about the sustainable business practices listed on this sheet?

Examples of N.C. Businesses That Save $$$’s with “Green” Methods

    •    The Bridge Street Café in Hot Springs lowers its electric bill by using energy efficient
         lighting and daylighting, and insulating its building well. The historic restaurant uses cloth
         napkins instead of paper and a soda fountain instead of aluminum cans. It recycles and
         composts.

    •    Burlington apparel manufacturer T.S. Designs has made many “green” changes. Most
         notable is the conversion to organic cotton and non-toxic dyes. Workers benefit from
         upgraded task lighting. The company mows and waters less after replacing their lawn with
         low-maintenance and attractive native plants. See www.tsdesigns.com.

    •    The Iredell-Statesville School District designed a new elementary school to use energy
         more efficiently. High-performance thermal windows, occupancy sensors that turn off lights
         automatically, and the use of natural light have cut the building’s utilities by 33%.
