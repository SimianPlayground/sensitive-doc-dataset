Module 4: Requisition/Purchase Orders




              A change order is a document entered to change the information contained in an open purchase
              order that has been posted and not fully liquidated by vendor invoices.

              What are some reasons for entering a Change Order?
                  •   Goods/services need to be adjusted (add/delete/clarify)
                  •   Accounting information is inaccurate
                  •   Vendor address needs to be changed
                  •   The dollar amount is inaccurate (requires decrease or increase)

              NOTE: To close the remaining balance on a PO, contact Purchasing. Do not enter a
              change order to perform this function.

                  The following fields cannot be modified:
                            Vendor ID – only vendor address type or sequence number can be changed



              When would a business unit enter a Change Order?
              Whenever the business unit becomes aware of a change needed, they should enter, and
              complete a change order. Final document approval will be applied by the campus purchasing
              office.

              Contact your Campus Purchasing Office if a copy of the purchase order needs to be sent to the
              vendor.


              What forms contain information about a Change Order?
                  •   Purchase Order Validation Form [FPIPOHD]
                  •   Purchase/Blanket/Change Order Query Form [FPIPURR]
                  •   Detail Encumbrance Activity Form [FGIENCD]


              Policies and Procedures
              As with any transaction, there are policies and procedures to follow for purchasing goods and
              services. You can find the specific details about when to use this process, what supporting
              documentation is required, etc. on-line in the USNH Financial and Administrative Procedures
              Manual at http://www.finadmin.unh.edu/pol_proc/chapter06/toc_06.html.

              This lesson will concentrate on the tasks and steps required to successfully enter a Change Order
              document according to USNH policies and procedures.

Lesson Summary

                           order.

               Task B      Next you learned about what data can be changed and how to enter the change
                           order document into the system as well as how to view the history of change
                           orders against a purchase order.

               Task C      Finally, you learned that there are no additional administrative tasks you need to
                           complete after entering the change order document.




Practice Exercise
               A purchase order has been previously entered for Fosters Clambake. The PO # is
               _______________________. You need to add the FOAPAL line 9U0000 YCFA10 060 to
               this order and split the total cost of the order between the existing FOAPAL and the new
               FOAPAL.

               Please enter a Change Order document to reflect this information.
