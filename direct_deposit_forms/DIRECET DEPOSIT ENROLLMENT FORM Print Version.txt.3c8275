                        BARRE CITY EMPLOYEE DIRECT DEPOSIT ENROLLMENT FORM

To enroll in direct deposit simply fill out this form and give it to the Payroll department. Attach a voided check for
each checking account – not a deposit slip. If depositing to a savings account, ask your bank to give you the routing
number/ transit number for your account. It isn’t always the same as the number on the savings deposit slip. This
will help insure that your funds are deposited correctly.

Below is a sample check MICR line, detailing where the information necessary to complete this form can be found.




IMPORTANT! Please read and sign before completing and submitting.

I hereby authorize the City of Barre to deposit any payroll amounts owed me, as instructed by my employer, by
initiating credit entries to my account at the financial institution (herein “bank”) indicated on this form. Further, I
authorize the the bank to accept and to credit any credit entries indicated by the City to my accounts. In the event the
City deposits funds erroneously into my account, I authorize the City to debit my account for an amount not to
exceed the original amount of the erroneous credit.

This authorization is to remain in force and effect until the City and Bank have received written notice from me of
its termination in such time and in such manner as to afford the City and Bank reasonable opportunity to act on it.
