Step 1:      Submit a completed Notice of Claim (claim form) via either by mail or by facsimile.

             The Participating Organization (not the Parent, Claimant or Agent) should:
              Fully answer each item in Part I, The Participating Organization Report.

                Read the fraud warning statement on page 3 and sign the form where indicated in Part I.

             The Parent/Guardian or Adult Claimant should:
                Fully answer each item in Part II, Other Insurance Statement.

                Review Part III, Authorizations

              Read the fraud warning statement on page 3 and sign where indicated on the bottom of the
             Claim Form.


Step 2:      Submit itemized medical bills for payment consideration to our office. If other insurance exists,
             include the other insurance company’s corresponding Explanation of Benefits (EOBs).


                      Helpful information for submitting claims and expediting payment.


   A fully completed Claim Form is required for each accident/injury. Claims submitted with incomplete
    information will not be paid pending receipt of the missing information.

   The acceptance of a claim form by an Insurance company is not an admission of coverage

   Providers may wish to bill us directly. If they do, please ensure a completed claim form has first been
    submitted to our office.

   In order to ensure we receive complete claim information, we suggest providers submit standardized
    billing statements (called “UB-04” for hospital charges and/or a “CMS-1500” for Physician Charges).

   Unless proof of payment is submitted with the medical bill (a copy of the check, a medical bill that
    indicates the claimant has made all or partial payment or zero balance information) claim payment is
    generally sent directly to the medical providers.
