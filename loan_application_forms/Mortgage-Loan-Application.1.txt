                                                        Uniform Residential Loan Application
This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as "Borrower" or "Co-Borrower," as applicable.
Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when                 the income or assets of a person other than the Borrower (including the Borrower's
spouse) will be used as a basis for loan qualification or        the income or assets of the Borrower's spouse or other person who has community property rights pursuant to state law
will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person has community property rights pursuant to applicable
law and Borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is located in a community property state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a
community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

If this is an application for joint credit, Borrower and Co-Borrower each agree that we intend to apply for joint credit (sign below):

 To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial
 institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.

 What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask you for your name, address, date of birth, and other
 information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents
 before opening the account.
