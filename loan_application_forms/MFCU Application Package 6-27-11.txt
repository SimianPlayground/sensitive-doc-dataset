Thank you for applying to Mission Federal Credit Union (Mission Fed) for your commercial real estate financing. We look forward to forming a solid relationship because your success is our
bottom line.
This loan application checklist lists the documentation Mission Fed requires to process any request for a multifamily or commercial real estate loan. All borrowers must provide all items in
section I. In addition, provide all items in section II, III and/or IV as applicable. Guarantees are required from all entities or individuals that have a 20 percent interest or more in the borrowing
entity, managing partner/member, or general partner. Mission Fed may require additional financial or other information in its sole discretion. Please do not hesitate to call us with any questions:
Frank Poole, (858) 546-2189.

The forms listed in Section I may be filled out electronically and e-mailed to Mission Fed to begin the underwriting process. The forms which require borrower signatures should be printed,
dated, signed and delivered to our office during preliminary loan processing to allow us to continue the processing. For those loan requests where there will be more than one guarantor providing
authorization and information, please copy the entire excel file and rename each file as that borrower's name.

To: Commercial Real Estate Loan Applicants (Applicant)

An Application Fee is required to be paid to Mission Fed upon submission to it of Applicant’s Commercial Real Estate Loan Application. The Fee is a good faith
deposit and is to be paid as partial payment of fees due Mission Fed when the Application is approved in addition to costs and expenses incurred related to the
Application, including, but are not limited to:
*   Mission Fed’s Loan Origination Fee
*   Appraisal (including costs of preparation and Mission Fed review)
*   Environmental Report(s) (including costs of preparation and Mission Fed review)
*   Title Report(s), Title Insurance and Escrow Fees
*   Flood Hazard Determination Fee
*   Tax Service Fee
*   Recording and Filing Fees
*   Mission Fed’s Documentation and Processing Fee for standard documentation (with no negotiated changes)
*   Credit Reports/Courier Fees/UCC Search Fees
* Legal Fees, if required. In the event that loan documentation modifications are required beyond the preparation of standard documentation covered by the
Documentation Fee referred to above, Applicant acknowledges that any such modifications may result in additional legal expenses, and that such expenses
may require pre-payment by Applicant.
* Fees due Broker(s) under an agreement or understanding for the purpose of obtaining a loan related to Applicant’s Application
* Other Fees and Costs not previously described
Applicant hereby authorizes Mission Fed to pay any such costs and expenses from the Application Fee. To the extent not so paid from the Application Fee,
Applicant will pay Mission Fed all such costs and expenses incurred by it upon termination or denial of the Application or expiration of any Commitment Letter or
the Closing of the Loan. If the Application Fee and/or other fees are paid at loan closing, Applicant authorizes Mission Fed to deduct such fees, costs and
expenses from the loan proceeds, through escrow. Nothing in this Agreement as to the anticipated source and timing of payment of fees, costs and expenses
shall condition or limit Applicant’s liability for such costs and expenses.
If the Application is declined or is approved by Mission Fed on substantially different but unacceptable terms to Applicant, said Fee will be returned less Mission
Fed's good faith fee and any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Mission Fed. Mission Fed's good faith fee of $1,000 will be credited to Mission Fed’s loan
costs but will not be refundable should the loan not fund for any reason.

Mission Fed is under no obligation to refund the Application Fee if it issues a Loan Commitment with substantially the same terms applied for and Applicant fails
to accept our commitment or the loan is not documented and closed on or before 30 days from the issuance of the Loan Commitment letter.

The amount of Application Fee to be submitted by Applicant with its Commercial Real Estate Loan Application is                         $_________________.

By signing below Applicant acknowledges its submission to Mission Fed of the Application Fee listed above, Applicant's understanding and acceptance of this
Agreement and acknowledges that payment of additional fees may be required in addition to those already submitted to Mission Fed in order to fulfill Applicant’s
obligations to Mission Fed for fees, costs and expenses incurred related to the Application. Additionally, Applicant acknowledges that all or a portion of the
Application Fee may not be returned to it in the event of denial, approval on substantially different terms unacceptable to Applicant or in the event that the
Applicant fails to accept our commitment or the loan is not documented and closed on or before 30 days from the issuance of the Loan Commitment letter.
