Important! Employees please read and sign the following before you complete and submit your account information.
The undersigned hereby authorizes his or her employer or its designee (“Employer”) to deposit any sums Employer owes to me
into the bank or other financial institution (“Financial Institution”) accounts identified below. The undersigned also authorizes
Financial Institution to receive and accept any such deposits and credit the same to my account. If any deposit is made to my
account in error by Employer, Financial Institution is authorized to return the erroneous payment to Employer and to debit my
account for the same in an amount not to exceed the amount of the erroneous deposit. Employees must verify all funds are
available prior to use of any funds posted. This authorization shall remain in effect until revoked by the undersigned in
writing so as to allow Employer and Financial Institution a reasonable opportunity to act. However, if hired after June 2013, a
Rapid Prepaid card will be set up to replace any closed accounts. Please note that all direct deposits will be pre-noted (with
the exception of Rapid Card), therefore you will receive a live check on the first payroll run that the direct deposit is set up.
Please note that The Employer deposits into Checking/ Savings accounts only. The Employer reserves the right to cancel direct
deposit without notice.
