I hereby give permission to medical personnel selected by the participant’s Church sponsor/his designee or camp staff to

I further authorize the release of the above medical information to appropriate medical personnel and/or the health cov-
erage insurance company. In addition, I have, and do hereby, release the church, its employees or agents from liability
associated with participation in a church activity.

I understand that if I do not have medical insurance, I, as the parent or guardian, will be responsible for any medical ex-
penses in the event of a sickness and/or injury.

I understand that there are risks involved in taking part in recreation activities and other activities related to participation in
youth functions.
