    DESCRIPTION OF THE SERVICES
    OR SUPPLIES PROVIDED


RETAIL PHARMACY PROGRAM
Prescription drugs and supplies purchased on and after January 1, 1994, from a Preferred retail pharmacy in the U.S. or Puerto Rico will be filed for the member. Preferred
pharmacies will not file claims for drugs requiring prior approval. Claims for drugs not filed by a retail pharmacy must be submitted to the Retail Pharmacy Program by the
member on the Retail Prescription Drug Claim Form. This form can be downloaded from www.fepblue.org.
You can also call 1-800-624-5060 for more information, claim forms and customer service assistance. The claim form provides detailed instructions for submission of the
form and should be mailed to: Service Benefit Plan Retail Pharmacy Program, P.O. Box 52057, Phoenix, AZ 85072-2057.
SPECIAL SERVICES
Certain services such as physical, speech and occupational therapy, durable medical equipment, home nursing care and dental care resulting from an accidental injury may
require additional information along with this claim form. Call your local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan before submitting your claim for such services; they will send
you additional forms, if needed.
FOR PATIENTS COVERED BY MEDICARE
When the patient is covered by Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and/or Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) and incurs expenses which are covered by Medicare, if
Medicare is primary (it pays first), your claim must be submitted to Medicare first (See Note Below). After the Medicare payment has been made, a claim for the expenses
not paid by Medicare, to include a copy of your Itemized bill, can be submitted to your local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan, along with the appropriate forms from
Medicare. For retail pharmacy prescription drug expenses, see the instructions above.
1. For Medicare Part A inpatient services, attach the “Explanation of Benefits” form from Medicare.
