                                                     EMPLOYEE AUTHORIZATION
          I hereby authorize The City of New York to deposit my net pay directly into my checking or savings account as requested. I also
          grant authorization for the reversal of a credit to my account in the event the credit was made in error. I understand that, under
          the "National Automated Clearing House Association" operating guidelines and rules, The City of New York can only reverse
          the amount of the incorrect direct deposit. I agree that this authorization will remain in effect until I provide to my agency a written
          cancellation to terminate the service.
