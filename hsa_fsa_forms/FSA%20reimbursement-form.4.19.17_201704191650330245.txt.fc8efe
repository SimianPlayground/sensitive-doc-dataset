To the best of my knowledge and belief, my statements on this Request for Reimbursement are complete and true. I am requesting reimbursement
only for eligible expenses incurred during the applicable Plan Year and for eligible Plan Participants. I certify that these expenses have not been
previously reimbursed under this or any other benefit plan and will not be claimed as an income tax deduction. I understand that the IRS regulates
my benefit account and that these guidelines are implemented as a means of ensuring compliance and approval for reimbursement. I further
understand that it is my responsibility to comply with these guidelines and to avoid submitting duplicate or ineligible requests, as doing so may
delay payment. I authorize my Benefit Account balance to be reduced by the amount requested.
