I, or my authorized representative, request that health information regarding my care and treatment be released as set forth on this form:
In accordance with New York State Law and the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA), I understand that:
1. This authorization may include disclosure of information relating to ALCOHOL and DRUG ABUSE, MENTAL HEALTH
TREATMENT, except psychotherapy notes, and CONFIDENTIAL HIV* RELATED INFORMATION only if I place my initials on
the appropriate line in Item 9(a). In the event the health information described below includes any of these types of information, and I
initial the line on the box in Item 9(a), I specifically authorize release of such information to the person(s) indicated in Item 8.
2. If I am authorizing the release of HIV-related, alcohol or drug treatment, or mental health treatment information, the recipient is
prohibited from redisclosing such information without my authorization unless permitted to do so under federal or state law. I
understand that I have the right to request a list of people who may receive or use my HIV-related information without authorization. If
I experience discrimination because of the release or disclosure of HIV-related information, I may contact the New York State Division
of Human Rights at (212) 480-2493 or the New York City Commission of Human Rights at (212) 306-7450. These agencies are
responsible for protecting my rights.
3. I have the right to revoke this authorization at any time by writing to the health care provider listed below. I understand that I may
revoke this authorization except to the extent that action has already been taken based on this authorization.
4. I understand that signing this authorization is voluntary. My treatment, payment, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for
benefits will not be conditioned upon my authorization of this disclosure.
5. Information disclosed under this authorization might be redisclosed by the recipient (except as noted above in Item 2), and this
redisclosure may no longer be protected by federal or state law.

                              Instructions for the Use
                   of the HIPAA-compliant Authorization Form to
                  Release Health Information Needed for Litigation



       This form is the product of a collaborative process between the New York State
Office of Court Administration, representatives of the medical provider community in
New York, and the bench and bar, designed to produce a standard official form that
complies with the privacy requirements of the federal Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and its implementing regulations, to be used to authorize
the release of health information needed for litigation in New York State courts. It can,
however, be used more broadly than this and be used before litigation has been
commenced, or whenever counsel would find it useful.

       The goal was to produce a standard HIPAA-compliant official form to obviate the
current disputes which often take place as to whether health information requests made in
the course of litigation meet the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. It should be
noted, though, that the form is optional. This form may be filled out on line and
downloaded to be signed by hand, or downloaded and filled out entirely on paper.

       When filing out Item 11, which requests the date or event when the authorization
will expire, the person filling out the form may designate an event such as “at the
conclusion of my court case” or provide a specific date amount of time, such as “3 years
from this date”.

        If a patient seeks to authorize the release of his or her entire medical record, but
only from a certain date, the first two boxes in section 9(a) should both be checked, and
the relevant date inserted on the first line containing the first box.
