  There is a $25 minimum payment amount.

  For claims reimbursed through Direct Deposit, I realize if I fail to notify Benefit Advantage of any bank account changes, a service
  fee of $10.00 will be charged for each direct deposit item. Returned items will be reissued as a paper reimbursement less the $10.00 fee.

  You must attach documentation that includes the following information for your claim to be paid:
                  Date(s) of Service Performed
                  Description of Service Performed *(i.e. eye exam, co-pay)
                  Amount of expense incurred
                  Name of Patient, & Service Provider
  *Undefined codes are not acceptable descriptions of your expense.
                                EMPLOYEE'S CERTIFICATION FOR REIMBURSEMENT
  I certify that the expenses for reimbursement requested from my accounts were incurred by me (and/or my spouse and/or eligible
  dependents), were not reimbursed by any other plan, and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, are eligible for reimbursement
  under my Reimbursement Plans. I (or we) will not use the expense reimbursed through this account as deductions or credits when
  filing my (our) individual income tax return.
