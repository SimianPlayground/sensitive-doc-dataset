    physician, other healthcare professional, hospital or any other healthcare organization (“providers”) to give Aetna or its agent information concerning the
    medical history, services or treatment provided to anyone listed on this Enrollment / Change Request form, including those involving mental health,
    substance abuse and HIV / AIDS. I further authorize Aetna to use such information and to disclose such information to affiliates, providers, payors, other
