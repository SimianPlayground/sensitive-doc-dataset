The Standards for Privacy of Personally identifiable Health Information, 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164, states that information used or disclosed pursuant to this
authorization may be subject to a re disclosure by the recipient of the information. The federal confidentiality Rules 42 CFR Part 2 prohibit making any further
disclosure of drug or alcohol information unless further disclosure of this information is expressly permitted by the written consent of the person to whom it pertains or
as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR Part 1. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information DOES NOT restrict any use of the information to
criminally investigate or prosecute any alcohol or drug abuse patient (52FR21809, June 9, 1987; 52 FR4 1997, November 2, 1987)
