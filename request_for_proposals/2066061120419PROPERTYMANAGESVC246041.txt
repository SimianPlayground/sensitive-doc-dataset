submitting proposals. All proposals shall remain firm for thirty (30) calendar days after the

proposal taking into consideration the evaluation criteria, responsiveness of the proposal to the
RFP requirements, program goals and objectives, benefits to the community, and overall costs to
the City.

The selected proposal will be presented before the City of College Park Mayor and City Council
for formal acceptance and authorization of an agreement.

    IX.      Proposal Rejections

The City reserves the right to accept or reject any or all responses and to waive technicalities as
deemed to be in the best interest of the City.

   B. Is delinquent in the payment of a loan(s) with the City;

    X.      Disclaimer / Reservation of Rights

The City does not make representations or warranties, express or implied, as to the accuracy and/or
completeness of the information provided in this RFP.

The City reserves the right to extend the deadline for submission of Proposals, to request
supplementary information, to conduct interviews with any or all of the responders submitting
proposals, to waive minor informalities, and to reject any or all proposals, in whole or in part, if in
its sole judgment the best interests of the City would be served in doing so. The City will reject
any and all proposals when required to do so by applicable law.

              this Agreement. Such assistance or cooperation by the City shall not be construed,
              and the Contractor agrees that it will not claim that any such assistance or
              cooperation operates, to relieve the Contractor from complete, proper and punctual
              performance of all the Contractor’s obligations under this Agreement.

              (a)   The City may, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (c) below, by written
                    notice of default to the Contractor, terminate the whole or any part of this
                    Agreement in any one of the following circumstances; (i) if the Contractor
                    fails to perform this Agreement within the time specified herein or any
                    extension thereof; or (ii) if the Contractor fails to perform any of the other
                    provisions of this Agreement, or so fails to make progress as to endanger
                    performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and does not

                    terminated, and the Contractor shall be liable to the City for any Excess costs
                    for the same, including without limitation all cost and expenses of the type
                    specified in the “WARRANTY” paragraph of this Agreement; provided, that
                    the Contractor shall continue the performance of this Agreement to the extent
                    not terminated hereunder.

              (c)   Except with regard to defaults of subcontractors, the Contractor shall not be
                    liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform this Agreement arises out
                    of causes beyond the control and without the fault of negligence of the
                    Contractor such causes may include, but are not limited to, acts of God, or
                    of the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or
                    contractual capacity, fires, flood, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes,
                    freight embargoes, and unusually severe weather, but in every case the
                    failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault or
                    negligence of the Contractor. If the failure to perform is caused by the default
                    of a subcontractor, and if such default arises out of causes beyond the control
                    of both the Contractor and the subcontractor, and without the fault of
                    negligence of either of them, the Contractor shall not be liable for any excess
                    costs for failure to perform, unless the services to be furnished by the
                    subcontractor were obtainable from other sources in sufficient time to permit
                    the Contractor to meet the required delivery schedule.                The term
                    “subcontractor” shall mean subcontractor at any tier.

              (d)   If, after notice of termination of this Agreement under the provisions of this
                    paragraph, it is determined for any reason that the Contractor was not in
                    default under the provisions above or that the default was excusable under
                    the provisions of this paragraph, the rights and obligations of the parties shall
                    be the same as if the notice of termination has been issued pursuant to the
                    “Termination for Convenience” paragraph of this Agreement.

              (e)   The rights and remedies of the City provided in this paragraph shall not be
                    exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by
                    law or under this Agreement.

       13.    TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE: The City may at any time by written notice
              terminate all or any part of this Agreement for the City’s convenience. If this
              Agreement is terminated, in whole or in part, for the City’s convenience, the
              Contractor shall be paid an amount, to be mutually agreed upon, which shall be
              adequate to cover the actual and reasonable cost paid by the Contractor for the
              actual goods and labor reasonably used by the Contractor to perform the work
              under this Agreement to the effective date of termination, plus a reasonable profit
              thereon; provided that no amount shall be paid to the Contractor for (i) any
              anticipatory profits related to work under this Agreement not yet performed, or (ii)
              costs incurred due to the Contractor’s failure to terminate work as ordered on the
              effective date of termination. In no event shall the total amount paid under the
              provisions of this paragraph exceed the prices set forth in this Agreement for the
              work terminated.
