SBA Form 1919 (Revised 4/14)                                      3
Please read the following restrictions regarding use of federal financial assistance programs. If you
understand them fully and agree to them, sign your name at the end of this document.
SBA is required to withhold or limit financial assistance, to impose special conditions on approved loans, to provide special
notices to applicants or borrowers and to require special reports and data from borrowers in order to comply with legislation
passed by the Congress and Executive Orders issued by the President and by the provisions of various inter-agency agreements.
SBA has issued regulations and procedures that implement these laws and executive orders. These are contained in Parts 112,
113, and 117 of Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations and in Standard Operating Procedures.

Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) -- Any person can request to see or get copies of any personal information that SBA has in his or
her file when that file is retrieved by individual identifiers such as name or social security numbers. Requests for information
about another party may be denied unless SBA has the written permission of the individual to release the information to the
requestor or unless the information is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

Under the provisions of the Privacy Act, you are not required to provide your social security number. Failure to provide your
social security number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to which you are entitled. Disclosures of name and other
personal identifiers are, however, required for a benefit, as SBA requires an individual seeking assistance from SBA to provide it
with sufficient information for it to make a character determination. In determining whether an individual is of good character,
SBA considers the person’s integrity, candor, and disposition toward criminal actions. Additionally, SBA is specifically
authorized to verify your criminal history, or lack thereof, pursuant to section 7(a)(1)(B), 15 USC Section 636(a)(1)(B) of the
Small Business Act ( the Act). Further, for all forms of assistance, SBA is authorized to make all investigations necessary to
ensure that a person has not engaged in acts that violate or will violate the Act or the Small Business Investment Act, 15 USC
Sections 634(b)(11) and 687(b)(a), respectively. For these purposes, you are asked to voluntarily provide your social security
number to assist SBA in making a character determination and to distinguish you from other individuals with the same or similar
name or other personal identifier.

The Privacy Act authorizes SBA to make certain “routine uses” of information protected by that Act. One such routine use is the
disclosure of information maintained in SBA’s investigative files system of records when this information indicates a violation
or potential violation of law, whether civil, criminal, or administrative in nature. Specifically, SBA may refer the information to
the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local or foreign, charged with responsibility for, or otherwise involved in
investigation, prosecution, enforcement or prevention of such violations. Another routine use is disclosure to other Federal
agencies conducting background checks; only to the extent the information is relevant to the requesting agencies' function. See,
74 F.R. 14890 (2009), and as amended from time to time for additional background and other routine uses.

Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3401) -- This is notice to you as required by the Right to Financial Privacy
Act of 1978, of SBA's access rights to financial records held by financial institutions that are or have been doing business with
you or your business, including any financial institutions participating in a loan or loan guaranty. The law provides that SBA
shall have a right of access to your financial records in connection with its consideration or administration of assistance to you in
the form of a Government guaranteed loan. SBA is required to provide a certificate of its compliance with the Act to a financial
institution in connection with its first request for access to your financial records, after which no further certification is required
for subsequent accesses. The law also provides that SBA's access rights continue for the term of any approved loan guaranty
agreement. No further notice to you of SBA's access rights is required during the term of any such agreement. The law also
authorizes SBA to transfer to another Government authority any financial records included in an application for a loan, or
concerning an approved loan or loan guarantee, as necessary to process, service or foreclose on a loan guaranty or collect on a
defaulted loan guaranty.

Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) -- This law provides, with some exceptions, that SBA must supply information
reflected in agency files and records to a person requesting it. Information about approved loans that will be automatically
released includes, among other things, statistics on our loan programs (individual borrowers are not identified in the statistics)
and other information such as the names of the borrowers (and their officers, directors, stockholders or partners), the collateral
pledged to secure the loan, the amount of the loan, its purpose in general terms and the maturity. Proprietary data on a borrower
would not routinely be made available to third parties. All requests under this Act are to be addressed to the nearest SBA office
and be identified as a Freedom of Information request.


Flood Disaster Protection Act (42 U.S.C. 4011) -- Regulations have been issued by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
and by SBA implementing this Act and its amendments. These regulations prohibit SBA from making certain loans in an FIA
designated floodplain unless Federal Flood insurance is purchased as a condition of the loan. Failure to maintain the required
level of flood insurance makes the applicant ineligible for any financial assistance from SBA, including disaster assistance.


SBA Form 1919 (Revised 4/14)                                       4
Executive Orders -- Floodplain Management and Wetland Protection (42 F.R. 26951 and 42 F.R. 26961) -- SBA
discourages settlement in or development of a floodplain or a wetland. This statement is to notify all SBA loan applicants that
such actions are hazardous to both life and property and should be avoided. The additional cost of flood preventive construction
must be considered in addition to the possible loss of all assets and investments due to a future flood.

Occupational Safety and Health Act (15 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) -- This legislation authorizes the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration in the Department of Labor to require businesses to modify facilities and procedures to protect employees or pay
penalty fees. Businesses can be forced to cease operations or be prevented from starting operations in a new facility. Therefore,
SBA may require additional information from an applicant to determine whether the business will be in compliance with OSHA
regulations and allowed to operate its facility after the loan is approved and disbursed. Signing this form as an applicant is
certification that the OSHA requirements that apply to the applicant business have been determined and that the applicant, to the
best of its knowledge, is in compliance. Furthermore, applicant certifies that it will remain in compliance during the life of the
loan.

Civil Rights Legislation (13 C.F.R. 112, 113, 117) -- All businesses receiving SBA financial assistance must agree not to
discriminate in any business practice, including employment practices and services to the public on the basis of categories cited
in 13 C.F.R., Parts 112, 113, and 117 of SBA Regulations. This includes making their goods and services available to
handicapped clients or customers. All business borrowers will be required to display the "Equal Employment Opportunity
Poster" prescribed by SBA.

Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691) -- The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from
discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or age (provided
the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any
public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection
Act.

Executive Order 11738 -- Environmental Protection (38 F.R. 251621) -- The Executive Order charges SBA with
administering its loan programs in a manner that will result in effective enforcement of the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water
Pollution Act and other environment protection legislation.

Debt Collection Act of 1982, Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq. and other titles) -- These laws require
SBA to collect aggressively any loan payments which become delinquent. SBA must obtain your taxpayer identification number
when you apply for a loan. If you receive a loan, and do not make payments as they come due, SBA may take one or more of
the following actions: (1) report the status of your loan(s) to credit bureaus, (2) hire a collection agency to collect your loan, (3)
offset your income tax refund or other amounts due to you from the Federal Government, (4) suspend or debar you or your
company from doing business with the Federal Government, (5) refer your loan to the Department of Justice or other attorneys
for litigation, or (6) foreclose on collateral or take other action permitted in the loan instruments.

Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-603) -- If you are an alien who was in this country illegally since
before January 1, 1982, you may have been granted lawful temporary resident status by the United States Immigration and
Naturalization Service pursuant to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. For five years from the date you are
granted such status, you are not eligible for financial assistance from the SBA in the form of a loan guaranty under Section 7(a)
of the Small Business Act unless you are disabled or a Cuban or Haitian entrant. When you sign this document, you are making
the certification that the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 does not apply to you, or if it does apply, more than five
years have elapsed since you have been granted lawful temporary resident status pursuant to such 1986 legislation.

Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821 et seq.)
Borrowers using SBA funds for the construction or rehabilitation of a residential structure are prohibited from using lead-based
paint (as defined in SBA regulations) on all interior surfaces, whether accessible or not, and exterior surfaces, such as stairs,
decks, porches, railings, windows and doors, which are readily accessible to children under 7 years of age. A "residential
structure" is any home, apartment, hotel, motel, orphanage, boarding school, dormitory, day care center, extended care facility,
college or other school housing, hospital, group practice or community facility and all other residential or institutional structures
where persons reside.

Executive Order 12549, Debarment and Suspension (13 C.F.R. 145) -- The prospective lower tier participant certifies, by
submission of this loan application, that neither it nor its principals are presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment,
declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction by any Federal department or agency. Where
the prospective lower tier participant is unable to certify to any of the statements in this certification, such prospective
participants shall attach an explanation to the loan application.
