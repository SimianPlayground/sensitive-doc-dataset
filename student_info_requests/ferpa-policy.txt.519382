  POLICY
  Pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the UTHSC Confidentiality
  and Disclosure of Student Records Policy, this notice is for students, faculty, and staff to advise
  that the following student information is directory information subject to disclosure by the
  University upon request: name; email address (university-supplied); classification; full-time or
  part-time status; major field of study; dates of attendance; degrees and awards received;
  photographic, video, or electronic images and / or voice of students taken and maintained by the
  university; and most recent previous educational institution attended.

  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT FERPA

  What is FERPA?
  FERPA is an acronym for the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, also known as the
  Buckley Amendment. This federal enactment establishes the legal parameters governing access
  to and release of student educational records.

  Who is required to comply with the standards set forth in FERPA?
  Any educational institution or educational administrative service that receives funds from the
  United States Secretary of Education must comply with the terms set forth in FERPA.

  What does FERPA require of colleges and universities?
  The Act encompasses six basic requirements of colleges and universities.
     1. Students must be annually notified of their FERPA rights.
     2. Students must be allowed to review their education records.
     3. Students must be allowed to request to amend their education records, with limited
         exceptions.
     4. Students must be allowed to limit disclosure of personally identifiable information
         contained in their education records.
     5. The college or university must undertake reasonable efforts to ensure that third parties


  SA100 – Annual Comprehensive FERPA Notice for Students                                                  PAGE 1
      do not re-disclose personally identifiable information and that the information is utilized
      by third parties only for its intended purpose.
   6. Records must be maintained of requests for and disclosure of student education records.

What are the consequences of non-compliance with FERPA requirements?
The consequences of non-compliance with FERPA requirements are serious. The Department of
Education may cite the offending institution with official notice to cease the practice of non-
compliance, and all funds administered by the Secretary of Education could be withheld from the
institution.

Who has FERPA rights?
According to the law, a person becomes a student and has FERPA rights when they are "in
attendance" at an institution. At UTHSC, we define a "student in attendance" as someone
currently or previously enrolled in any academic program offering. This does not include
prospective students or applicants to any UTHSC academic program. Students in attendance
include attendance in person, via distance education or remotely by videoconference, satellite,
Internet, other electronic telecommunication technologies, and individuals who are auditing
course(s) and taking continuing education classes. FERPA becomes effective on the term of the
first day of classes for those newly matriculating students who have scheduled at least one
course. A newly admitted student who accepts an admissions offer but does not schedule at least
one course and does not matriculate, or a newly admitted student who cancels his/her
registration either before or after the semester begins, is not covered by FERPA. A student’s
FERPA rights only expire upon the death of the student.

What are "education records"?
FERPA defines education records as any record that directly relates to a student and is maintained
by an educational agency or a party acting on behalf of the institution. Examples of education
records include, but are not limited to
   • Transcripts
   • Degree Audit Reports
   • Schedules of Classes
   • Class Rolls
   • Academic History Reports
   • Grade Rolls
   • Financial Records

The following items are NOT education records, as defined by FERPA
   • Sole possession records (records kept in the sole possession of the maker, used as a
        personal memory aid and not revealed to others)
   • Law enforcement records
   • Employment records, provided the employment is not contingent upon being a student.
   • Medical, psychological, counseling, or mental health records, that are maintained for


SA100 – Annual Comprehensive FERPA Notice for Students                                    PAGE 2
       treatment purposes
   •   Peer-graded papers, before they are collected and recorded by the instructor
   •   Post Attendance, education records created or received by the educational institution
       after the individual is no longer in attendance
   •   Education records, not directly related to the individual’s attendance as a student

Who may have access to personally identifiable education records?
FERPA allows University officials and officials of agencies acting on behalf of the university with
"legitimate educational interest" to access personally identifiable education records. A University
official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or
research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff);
contractors, consultants, volunteers and other outside parties to whom the institution has
outsourced institutional services or functions instead of using University employees or officials
(such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or
a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or
assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.

What is directory information?
Directory information is information about a student that is not generally considered harmful if
disclosed. Directory information may be disclosed UNLESS the student has invoked the FERPA
right to limit disclosure of that information.
    • Name
    • Email address (university-supplied)
    • Classification
    • Most recent previous educational institution attended
    • Graduate or Undergraduate level (full or part-time)
    • Full-time or Part-time status
    • College
            o Major Field of Study
            o Dates of Attendance
            o Degrees and Awards
            o Participation in Officially Recognized Activities
            o Photographic, video, or electronic images and / or voice of students taken and
                 maintained by the university

What is NOT directory information?
All non-directory information the university maintains about a particular student, including such
information as
    • Social security number
    • Grades
    • Term and cumulative GPAs



SA100 – Annual Comprehensive FERPA Notice for Students                                     PAGE 3
   •   Student schedule
   •   Academic history
   •   Academic standing

Are UTHSC students notified about FERPA rights?
UTHSC students are informed each semester about their FERPA rights. Updates are also posted
at https://www.uthsc.edu/registrar/documents/ferpa-faculty-and-students-notice.pdf

How do students invoke their rights to limit the disclosure of directory
information?
Students wishing limited disclosure may submit a request with the University Registrar. We will
suppress your directory information in the UTHSC Directory, and will exclude the directory
information by contacting the IT department and notifying the Banner Student Information
System that you have restricted release of public or student directory information without
written consent. Students who have questions may visit the Office of the Registrar, 910 Madison
Ave, Suite 520, Memphis, TN, or contact us at 901-448-5568 or registrar@uthsc.edu.
The Restrict Release of Directory Information Form is available to view online at:
http://www.uthsc.edu/registrar/documents/Restrict_Release_of_Directory_Information_Form.
pdf. A paper copy will be provided upon request.

FERPA permits the University to disclose directory information without a student's consent
unless a student, prior to the 14th calendar day after the term begins, notifies the Office the
Registrar in writing of his or her desire to restrict directory information from being published.

If students opt out of the release of directory information, how will this impact
inclusion in the University Commencement Program and UTHSC marketing and
communication materials?
By opting out of directory information, the University will not include or use the student's photo,
image, and/or voice in any and all University of Tennessee Health Science Center and/or
University of Tennessee newsletters, articles, news releases, brochures or other communications
and marketing materials. During the first day of classes for the term in which the student plans
to graduate, the student MUST file a written request with the Registrar's Office to have his or her
name included in the official Commencement Program.

May faculty members post the grades of their students?
Grades MAY NOT be publicly posted by student names, by Student ID numbers, by Social Security
Numbers, or by any other personally identifiable means, unless students give permission in
writing. Public posting includes printed lists or Web sites. Grades may be posted if the instructor
has implemented a system of code words or randomly assigned numbers known only by the
instructor and the individual student. Under these conditions, posting should NOT be done
alphabetically.



SA100 – Annual Comprehensive FERPA Notice for Students                                     PAGE 4
What may faculty members include in their letters of recommendation for
students?
Recommendations that are made by personal observation or knowledge do not require a
student’s written permission. If personally identifiable information from a student’s education
record, such as grades or GPAs, is included, a signed release from the student is required. The
release must:
    • Specify the records that may be disclosed;
    • State the purpose of disclosure;
    • Identify the party or class of parties to which disclosure may be made;
    • Be signed and dated by the student.

Can UTHSC verify the authenticity of my educational records?
UTHSC may attempt to confirm the authenticity of a transcript, letter of recommendation, or
other record by sending the suspicious record back to the school official from whom the record
supposedly originated. The school official may confirm or deny that the record is authentic and,
if it is not authentic, the school official may send the correct record. The institution is not required
to notify the student that the institution suspects a document is fraudulent.

In the event of a health or safety emergency, can the school disclose information
to my parents?
Yes. If a health emergency involves their child, UTHSC is permitted to disclose information from
education records to parents. However, the disclosure of the information is limited to what is
deemed necessary to manage the emergency situation.

If a student is in violation of alcohol consumption and controlled substance rules
can parents be informed?
Yes. If a student is under the age of 21, UTHSC is permitted to inform parents of any violation of
law or policy concerning the possession of alcohol or controlled substances.

Can law enforcement unit records be disclosed to my parents?
Law enforcement unit records can be disclosed to anyone including parents, federal, state and
local law authorities WITHOUT the consent of the student. UTHSC has its own campus police unit,
as do many colleges and universities. Any records maintained by these units are exempt from
privacy restrictions of FERPA.

Can UTHSC disclose information to parents of dependent students?
Under FERPA, UTHSC may disclose any and all information to parents who have students that are
dependent for tax purposes or if students voluntarily provide a waiver consenting to release of
information WITHOUT their consent.

FERPA and parents of dependent students
A “dependent student” means a child under the age of 23 who is a student and who is claimed
by a parent as a dependent of the parent on the parents’ Federal Income Tax Form (104). FERPA
allows the disclosure of non-directory information about the student to the parent if the
institution can establish the dependency status of the student.

   •   The parent(s) should make their request in writing, indicating the particular records
       requested and declaring specifically that the student is the requestor(s)’s dependent.
   •   The institution must ask for the Federal Income Tax Form filed by the parents for the most
       recent tax year. The institution is not entitled to maintain a copy of that federal tax form;
       so verification is made and noted on the written request for records and the tax forms
       are returned to the parent(s).
   •   Since FERPA rights belong to the eligible student, the institution should notify the student
       that his or her parent(s) have asked to review records. Like the advice that is mailed out
       upon receipt of a subpoena for records, the institution should instruct students that
       records will be provided to their parents for review on a particular date. If a student
       responds that he or she does not want the records shared with his or her parent(s), the
       institution should refer the parent(s) back to the student. At this point, in order to provide
       access to the student's records, a prior, written consent is required from the student.

Of course, the problem may arise when students indicate that they do not wish the institution to
share records with their parent(s). Because the student is an adult and guaranteed full rights
under FERPA, the recommendation in this case is that the institution refer the parent(s) back to
the student. Our effective, non-emotional approach is to provide the parent(s) with a copy of our
Annual Notification and explain that the privacy of student records is governed by federal
regulations that guarantee students certain rights.

What are possible federal and state data collection and uses?
As of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education's FERPA regulations expand the
circumstances under which education records and personally identifiable information (PII)
contained in such records – including Social Security Number, grades, or other private
information – may be accessed without student consent. First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the
U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities
("Federal and State Authorities") may allow access to student records and PII without student
consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal – or
state – supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is
"principally engaged in the provision of education," such as early childhood education and job
training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution.
Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to education records and PII without
student consent to researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when
we object to or do not request such research. Federal and State Authorities must obtain certain
use-restriction and data security promises from the entities that they authorize to receive PII, but



SA100 – Annual Comprehensive FERPA Notice for Students                                       PAGE 6
the Authorities need not maintain direct control over such entities. In addition, in connection
with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile, permanently
retain, and share without student consent PII from education records, and they may track
participation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information
that they obtain from other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development,
unemployment insurance, child welfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student
records systems.

What is the complaint procedure?
A complaint must contain specific allegations of fact giving reasonable cause to believe that a
violation of the Act has occurred.

The Office investigates each timely complaint to determine whether the educational agency or
institution has failed to comply with the provisions of the Act.

A timely complaint is defined as an allegation of a violation of the Act that is submitted to the
Office within 180 days of the date of the alleged violation or of the date that the complainant
knew or reasonably should have known of the alleged violation.

The Office may extend the time limit for good cause shown.
