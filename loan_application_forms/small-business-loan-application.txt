The undersigned represents that the information contained in this application and related documents are true and correct to the best of their knowledge and was given to induce the lender to grant the loan for
which this application was made and further states that no information which may relate to the credit worthiness of the undersigned or borrower has been omitted. The undersigned authorizes MBC or its agent
to verify the information submitted herein and conduct necessary investigations with credit unions, banks, credit bureaus, employers and any references listed in the application. The borrower acknowledges
that maintaining a membership in a Credit Union affiliated with MBC will be a requirement of receiving funds from MBC. Borrower, in applying to MBC, is not applying directly to a Credit Union although the
eventual credit approval of one or more Credit Unions will be required. Consideration to the Credit Union listed in this application's membership section shall generally be given. MBC may choose to sell or
participate this loan with other lenders and Borrower grants permission to MBC to share the application materials and other investigative reports as appropriate. In the event MBC's Credit Unions are unable to
extend credit as requested in this application, Borrower gives authorization to MBC to release information regarding the business and any related personal information to alternative lending sources in order to
facilitate the possibility of receiving financing. Borrower agrees to hold MBC and its Credit Unions harmless against any liability that may arise out of their referral of the above mentioned business to an
alternative lending source. The lender may at its option, cancel any Commitment or Loan granted if this application contains any false or misleading information; the credit investigation discloses any
unsatisfactory credit record; a lien search or title examination discloses unsatisfactory conditions which are not correctable within a reasonable time or if the undersigned has borrowed any portion of the
investment or equity in the property not indicated in this application. I further authorize MBC and/or its lender to share my information with other parties for products and services that would be of benefit.
This application and all accompanying information shall remain the property of MBC or the lender. If needed, please request copies at the point of application.
