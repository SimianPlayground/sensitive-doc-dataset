providing public safety software systems to submit proposals for a comprehensive Internal Affairs
Software Solution.

I.    INTRODUCTION

The Internal Affairs Unit of DeKalb County Government, a business unit within DeKalb County
Police Department is seeking to procure a business-critical Internal Affairs Software solution that
supports its public safety operations to help mitigate regulatory and compliance risks. This solution
must be reliable, scalable and have the capabilities to interface with other software systems. The
application must also be accessible via desktop computer or Police mobile unit. The Internal Affairs
Unit requires a system that is robust, configurable and delivers a product that enables cross-functional
departmental collaboration.

This need is driven by the new federal request on the issue of “use of force” in law enforcement and
the overall business practices within the Internal Affairs Unit. To ensure compliance with policies and
accountability to its citizenry and increase productivity, it is preferable that the solution proposed
meets the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requirements. The
department requires the services of a vendor who would demonstrate competences in articulating and
turning its business need into a fully functional solution using best practice.




                                                                           3

      SCHEDULE OF LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PARTICIPATION
                     OPPORTUNITY TRACKING FORM

The Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Commissioners of DeKalb County believe that it is
important to encourage the participation of small and local businesses in the continuing business of
County government; and that the participation of these types of businesses in procurement will
strengthen the overall economic fabric of DeKalb County, contribute to the County’s economy and tax
base, and provide employment to local residents. Therefore, the Chief Executive Officer and the Board
of Commissioners have made the success of local small businesses a permanent goal of DeKalb County
by implementing the DeKalb First Local Small Business Enterprise Ordinance.

     PROVISIONS OF DEKALB FIRST LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (LSBE)
                                 ORDINANCE

                              Percentage of LSBE Participation Required
                                         20% of Total Award

                  Certification Designation                  Request For Proposals
                                                                     (RFP)
                  LSBE Within DeKalb (LSBE-                Ten (10) Preference
                  DeKalb)                                  Points
                  LSBE Outside DeKalb (LSBE-               Five (5) Preference Points
                  MSA)
                  Demonstrated GFE                         Two (2) Preference Points

Certified Local Small Business Enterprises (LSBEs) located within DeKalb County and prime
contractors utilizing LSBEs that are locally-based inside DeKalb County shall receive ten (10) points
in the initial evaluation of their response to any Request for Proposal. Certified LSBEs located outside
of DeKalb County but within the nine (9) County Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) consisting of
Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale Counties shall
receive five (5) points in the initial evaluation of their response to any Request for Proposal. Prime
Contractors who demonstrate sufficient good faith efforts in accordance with the requirements of the
ordinance shall be granted two (2) points in their initial evaluation of responses to any Request for
Proposal. Pro-rated points shall be granted where a mixture of LSBE-DeKalb and LSBE MSA firms
are utilized. Utilization of each firm shall be based upon the terms of the qualified sealed solicitation.

Prime Contractor(s) deemed responsible and remains responsive to an Invitation to Bid (ITB) because
they are either a certified LSBE-DeKalb or LSBE-MSA firm or has obtained 20% participation of
an LSBE-DeKalb or LSBE-MSA firm, submits the lowest bid price shall be deemed the
lowest, responsive and responsible bidder.

Prime Contractor(s) deemed responsible and remains responsive to an Invitation to Bid (ITB) and
documented good faith efforts, submits a lower bid price than a Prime Contractor that achieved 20%
LSBE participation, or otherwise required benchmark, then the Prime Contractor who actually met the



                                                   25
benchmark will be given the opportunity to match the lowest bid price of the Prime Contractor who
only made good faith efforts. Prime Contractor(s) who choose not to match the lowest bid price, then
the Prime Contractor who made the good faith efforts will be deemed the lowest, responsive and
responsible bidder.

For all qualified sealed solicitations, the Director of Purchasing and Contracting, DeKalb County
Government, shall determine if the bidder/proposer has included written documentation showing that
at least twenty percent (20%) of the total contract award will be performed by a certified LSBE. This
written documentation shall be in the form of a notarized Schedule of LSBE Participation (Attached
hereto as “Exhibit A”.) For all contracts, a signed letter of intent from all certified LSBEs describing
the work, material, equipment and/or services to be performed or provided by the LSBE(s) and the
agreed upon percentage shall be due with the bid or proposal documents and included with “Exhibit A”.
The certified vendor list establishes the group of Certified LSBE’s from which the bidder/proposer must
solicit subcontractors for LSBE participation. This list can be found on our website
http://www.dekalbcountyga.gov/purchasing-contracting/about-purchasing-and-contracting or obtained
from the Special Projects LSBE Program team.

Prime Contractors failing to meet the LSBE benchmark must document and demonstrate Good Faith
Efforts in accordance with the attached “Checklist for Good Faith Efforts” portion of “Exhibit A.” The
notarized Schedule of LSBE Participation shall be due and submitted with each bid or proposal. Failure
to achieve the LSBE benchmark or demonstrate good faith efforts shall result in a bid or proposal being
rejected. Prime Contractors that fail to attend the mandatory LSBE meeting in person or via video
conference shall mean that the Prime Contractor has not demonstrated sufficient good faith efforts and
its bid or proposal if submitted, shall be deemed non-responsive without any further review.

Upon award, Prime Contractors are required to submit a report detailing LSBE Sub-Contractor usage
with each request for payment and not less than on a monthly basis. Prime Contractors shall ensure that
all LSBE sub-contractors have been paid within seven (7) days of the Prime’s receipt of payment from
the County. Failure to provide requested reports/documentation shall constitute a material breach of
contract, entitling the County to terminate the Contract for default or pursue other remedies. LSBE sub-
contractors must confirm payments received from the Prime(s) for each County contract they participate
in.

For eligible bids/proposals valued over $5,000,000.00, the Mentor-Protégé provision of the Ordinance
shall apply. Prime Contractors must agree to become mentors and take on an LSBE protégé in an effort
to enhance the potential of future LSBEs. Qualifying projects shall be performed by both Mentor and
Protégé through a subcontract between both parties. This requirement is in addition to all other
applicable sections of the DeKalb First Ordinance. Please review the ordinance, section 2-214 or contact
the LSBE Program Representative for detailed information regarding this initiative.

or not any of these actions were taken:

           Yes          No         Description of Actions
1.                                 Prime Contractors shall attend a MANDATORY LSBE Meeting in
                                   person or via video conference within two-weeks of advertisement of
                                   the solicitation.
2.                                 Provide a contact log showing the company’s name, contact person,
                                   address, email and contact number (phone or fax) used to contact the

                                   any, at least 5 business days prior to submission of the bid or proposal.
4.                                 Efforts made to divide the work for LSBE subcontracting areas likely
                                   to be successful and to identify portions of work available to LSBEs
                                   consistent with their availability. Include a list of divisions of work not
                                   subcontracted and the corresponding reasons for not including them.
                                   The ability or desire of a bidder/proposer to perform the contract work
                                   with its own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to
                                   make good faith efforts on all scopes of work subject to subcontracting.
5.                                 Efforts were made to assist potential LSBE subcontractors meet
                                   bonding, insurance, or other governmental contracting requirements.

                                   they are of such a specialized nature that the LSBE could not readily

6.                                 Communication via email or phone with DeKalb First Program Staff

for Proposals (RFP) No. XX-XXXXXX for _______________________, attached hereto as Appendix
I and incorporated herein by reference, and the Contractor’s response thereto, attached hereto as
Appendix II and incorporated herein by reference.




              SAMPLE
The Contractor’s services shall include all things, personnel, and materials necessary to accomplish
specific projects authorized by the County. Specific Work Authorizations will have precedence over
any interpretation within the Contract.
                                     ARTICLE V. GENERAL CONDITIONS
     A. Accuracy of Work The Contractor shall be responsible for the accuracy of the Work and any
error and/or omission made by the Contractor in any phase of the Work under this Agreement.
     B. Additional Work The County shall in no way be held liable for any work performed under
this section which has not first been approved in writing by the County in the manner required by
applicable law and/or the terms of this Contract. The County may at any time order changes within
the scope of the Work without invalidating the Contract upon seven (7) days written notice to the
Contractor. The Contractor shall proceed with the performance of any changes in the Work so ordered
by the County unless such change entitles the Contractor to a change in Contract Price, and/or Contract
Term, in which event the Contractor shall give the County written notice thereof within fifteen (15)
days after the receipt of the ordered change, and the Contractor shall not execute such changes until it
receives an executed Change Order from the County. No extra cost or extension of time shall be
allowed unless approved by the County and authorized by execution of a Change Order. The parties’
execution of any Change Order constitutes a final settlement of all matters relating to the change in the
Work which is the subject of the Change Order. The County shall not be liable for payment for any
work performed under this section which has not first been approved in writing by the County in the
manner required by applicable law and/or the terms of this Contract.
     C. Ownership of Documents All documents, including drawings, estimates, specifications, and
data are and remain the property of the County. The Contractor agrees that the County may reuse any
and all plans, specifications, drawings, estimates, or any other data or documents described herein in
its sole discretion without first obtaining permission of the Contractor and without any payment of any
monies to the Contractor therefore. However, any reuse of the documents by the County on a different
site shall be at its risk and the Contractor shall have no liability where such documents are reused.




                                                   36
     D. Right to Audit The County shall have the right to audit all books and records, including
electronic records, relating or pertaining to this contract or agreement, including but not limited to all
financial and performance related records, property, and equipment purchased in whole or in part with
County funds and any documents or materials which support those records, kept under the control of
the Contractor, including but not limited to those kept by the Contractor’s employees, agents, assigns,
successors and subcontractors. The County also has the right to communicate with Contractor’s
employees related to the audited records.
    The Contractor shall maintain such books and records, together with such supporting or underlying
documents and materials, for the duration of this contract and for seven (7) years after termination or
expiration, including any and all renewals thereof. The books and records, together with supporting
documents and materials shall be made available, upon request to the County or its designee, during
normal business hours at the Contractor’s office or place of business. In the event that no such location
is available, then the books, records, and supporting documents shall be made available for audit at a
time and location which is convenient for the County.
     E. Successors and Assigns The Contractor agrees it shall not sublet, assign, transfer, pledge,
convey, sell, or otherwise dispose of the whole or any part of this Contract or his right, title, or interest
therein to any person, firm, or corporation without the previous written consent of the County. If the
County consents to any such assignment or transfer, then the Contractor binds itself, its partners,
successors and assigns to all covenants of this Contract. Nothing contained in this Contract shall create,
nor be interpreted to create privity, or any other relationship whatsoever, between the County and any
person, or entity or than Contractor.




              SAMPLE
     F. Reviews and Acceptance Work performed by the Contractor shall be subject to review and
acceptance in stages as required by the County. Acceptance shall not relieve the Contractor of its
professional obligation to correct, at his own expense, any errors in the Work.
     G. Termination of Agreement The Contractor understands and agrees that the date of the
beginning of Work, rate of progress, and time for completion of the Work are essential conditions of
this Contract. The County may, for its own convenience and at its sole option, without cause and
without prejudice to any other right or remedy of County, elect to terminate the Contract by delivering
to the Contractor, at the address listed in the Notices article of this Contract, a written notice of
termination specifying the effective date of termination. Such notice shall be delivered to Contractor
at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of termination. If Contractor’s services are terminated
by the County, the termination will not affect any rights or remedies of the County then existing or
which may thereafter accrue against Contractor or its surety. In case of termination of this Contract
before completion of the Work, Contractor will be paid only for the portion of the Work satisfactorily
performed through the effective date of termination as determined by the County. Neither party shall
be entitled to recover lost profits, special, consequential or punitive damages, attorney’s fees or costs
from the other party to this Contract for any reason whatsoever. This Contract shall not be deemed to
provide any third-party with any remedy, claim, right of action, or other right. The parties’ obligations
pursuant to this Section shall survive any acceptance of Work, or termination or expiration of this
Contract.
     H. Indemnification Agreement The Contractor shall be responsible from the execution date or
from the time of the beginning of the Work, whichever shall be the earlier, for all injury or damage of
any kind resulting from the Work, to persons or property, including employees and property of the
County. The Contractor shall exonerate, indemnify, and save harmless the County, its elected officials,
officers, employees, agents and servants, hereinafter collectively referred to in this Section as “the
County Indemnitees,” from and against all claims or actions based upon or arising out of any damage
or injury (including without limitation any injury or death to persons and any damage to property)
caused by or sustained in connection with the performance of this Contract or by conditions created
thereby or arising out of or any way connected with Work performed under this Contract, as well as



                                                     37
all expenses incidental to the defense of any such claims, litigation, and actions. Furthermore,
Contractor shall assume and pay for, without cost to the County Indemnitees, the defense of any and
all claims, litigation, and actions suffered through any act or omission of the Contractor, or any
Subcontractor, or anyone directly or indirectly employed by or under the supervision of any of them.
Notwithstanding any language or provision in this Contract, Contractor shall not be required to
indemnify any County Indemnitee against claims, actions, or expenses based upon or arising out of the
County Indemnitee’s sole negligence. As between the County Indemnitees and the Contractor as the
other party, the Contractor shall assume responsibility and liability for any damage, loss, or injury,
including death, of any kind or nature whatever to person or property, resulting from any kind of claim
made by Contractor’s employees, agents, vendors, Suppliers or Subcontractors caused by or resulting
from the performance of Work under this Contract, or caused by or resulting from any error, omission,
or the negligent or intentional act of the Contractor, vendors, Suppliers, or Subcontractors, or any of
their officers, agents, servants, or employees. The Contractor shall defend, indemnify, and hold
harmless the County Indemnitees from and against any and all claims, loss, damage, charge, or expense
to which they or any of them may be put or subjected by reason of any such damage, loss, or injury.
The Contractor expressly agrees to provide a full and complete defense against any claims brought or
actions filed against the County Indemnitees, where such claim or action involves, in whole or in part,
the subject of the indemnity contained in this Contract, whether such claims or actions are rightfully
or wrongfully brought or filed. The County has the sole discretion to choose the counsel who will
provide the defense. No provision of this Contract and nothing herein shall be construed as creating
any individual or personal liability on the part of any elected official, officer, employee, agent or




             SAMPLE
servant of the County, nor shall the Contract be construed as giving any rights or benefits hereunder to
anyone other than the parties to this Contract. The parties’ obligations pursuant to this Section shall
survive any acceptance of Work, or termination or expiration of this Contract.

                   or the joint venture will be a named insured under each respective policy

         (e)     Certificates are to be issued to:
                                 DeKalb County, Georgia
                                 Director of Purchasing & Contracting
                                 The Maloof Center, 2nd Floor
                                 1300 Commerce Drive
                                 Decatur, Georgia 30030
     5. The Contractor shall be wholly responsible for securing certificates of insurance
         coverage as set forth above from all subcontractors who are engaged in this work.
     6. The Contractor agrees to carry statutory Workers’ Compensation Insurance and to have
         all subcontractors likewise carry statutory Workers’ Compensation Insurance.
     7. Contractor agrees to waive all rights of subrogation and other rights of recovery against
         the County and its officers and shall cause each Subcontractor to waive all rights of
         subrogation for all coverage, excluding Professional E&O.
     8. Failure of the County to demand such certificate or other evidence of full compliance
         with these insurance requirements or failure of the County to identify a deficiency from



                                            39
               evidence provided will not be construed as a waiver of the Contractor’s obligation to
               maintain such coverage. Contractor understands and agrees that the purchase of
               insurance in no way limits the liability of the Contractor.
           9. Certificates shall state that the policy or policies shall not expire, be cancelled or altered
               without at least sixty (60) days prior written notice to the County. Policies and

               and approval such policies of insurance with all endorsements, or confirmed specimens
               thereof certified by the insurance company to be true and correct copies. Contractor
               shall be responsible and have the financial wherewithal to cover any deductibles or
               retentions included on the certificate of insurance.

    J. Georgia Laws Govern The laws of the State of Georgia shall govern the construction of this
Contract without regard for conflicts of laws. Should any provision of this Contract require judicial
interpretation, it is agreed that the court interpreting or construing the same shall not apply a
presumption that the terms hereof shall be more strictly construed against one party, by reason of the

              SAMPLE
preparation hereof, and all parties have had an adequate opportunity to consult with legal counsel. In

written or typed hereon, shall be given equal weight, and there shall be no inference by operation of
law or otherwise; that any provision of this Contract shall be construed against either party hereto.

Georgia. For the purposes of venue, all suits or causes of action arising out of this Agreement shall be
brought in the courts of DeKalb County, Georgia.
