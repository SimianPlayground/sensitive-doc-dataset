While price alone is not the sole basis for award, price remains the primary consideration when awarding a contract under the
competitive proposal method.

The LEA’s officers, employees, board members, or agents shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, nor anything of
monetary value from contractors nor potential contractors. To the extent permissible under state law, rules, or
regulations, such standards shall be provided for appropriate penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions to be applied for
violations of such standards.

Competition

 All procurement transactions must be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the standards of
this section. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that
develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, or invitations for bids or requests for proposals must be excluded
from competing for such procurements. (2 CFR 200.319)

Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:

(1) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business;
(2) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding;
(3) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies;
(4) Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer contracts;
(5) Organizational conflicts of interest;
(6) Specifying only a ‘‘brand name’’ product instead of allowing ‘‘an equal’’ product to be offered and describing the
performance or other relevant requirements of the procurement; and
(7) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process

General Information – Terms and Conditions to be Included in RFP\Contract (Pages 14-27)

The LEA wishes to retain the FSMC to provide certain food and food related services at the sites specified by the LEA. The contract
is acknowledged by the LEA and FSMC to be satisfactory and adequate. Both parties agree as follows:


   1. The food service program provided shall be operated and maintained as a benefit to the LEA students, faculty, and staff.
   2. The FSMC must give evidence of financial stability.
   3. The FSMC must be licensed to do business in the State of Missouri.
   4. Award shall be made to a qualified and responsible offer whose proposal is most responsive to this solicitation. A responsible
      offer is one who’s financial, technical, and other resources indicate an ability to perform the services required by this solicitation.
   5. The FSMC or their authorized representatives are expected to fully inform themselves as to the conditions, requirements, and
      specifications before submitting proposals; failure to do so will be at the FSMCs own risk and cannot secure relief on the plea of
      error.
   6. The LEA is not liable for any cost incurred by the FSMC prior to the signing of a contract by all parties. Paying the FSMC from the
      Child Nutrition Program funds is prohibited until the contract is approved by the SA, and signed by both parties.
   7. Provisions for equipment purchases that entail repayment to the FSMC over a period in excess of one year are not
      permitted.
   8. No oral interpretation will be made to any FSMC as to the meaning of the RFP. Any oral communication will be considered
      unofficial and non-binding on the LEA. Unauthorized contact by the FSMC with other LEA employees or LEA Board Member
      regarding the RFP may result in disqualification. Each request for such interpretation shall be made in writing to the LEA. Every
      interpretation made to the FSMC will be in the form of an addendum to the specification, mailed to each FSMC, and will be on
      file at the school. All such addenda shall become part of the final contract and FSMC shall be bound by such addenda.
   9. In the event the contract initially awarded by the LEA is terminated for any reason within 120 days of the due date for proposals,
      the LEA reserves the right to accept any other submitted proposal in conformance to the requirements of this solicitation
      including submission by the original date by which such proposals where due.
  10. A material change is a change that, had other bidders known of the change at the time they submitted their responses, would
      have caused them to bid differently. In this instance, the LEA should publish a new solicitation that accounts for anticipated
      changes in labor fees and award a new contract for the next school year. Scenario: fees requested by a FSMC that are in addition
      to the fixed price as agreed to in a contract awarded through means of an (a)IFB or (b)an RFP cannot be paid from the nonprofit
      school food service account (NSFSA). The additional fees represent a material change to the contract.

Intent

  1. The FSMC shall conduct the food service in such a manner as will ensure compliance with the rules and regulations of the
     SA and the USDA regarding Child Nutrition Programs.
  2. The LEA is prohibited from entering into contracts that are on a “cost-plus-a-percentage of cost” or “cost-plus-a-
     percentage-of-income” basis.
  3. If the LEA determines that significant changes are necessary, the LEA must rebid the contract. The following changes would
     normally not substantially change the contract.
     Number of schools - new schools added;
     Changes in enrollment - decreased and increased in student enrollment and the corresponding
     change expected in participation;
     Changes in meal prices charged to students by LEA - meal price changes (determined by the LEA);
     Cost increases - cost increases limited to a measurable index (such as the Consumer Price Index for all Urban
     Consumers).Examples of substantive changes which could require the LEA to rebid the contract include; the addition of
     a program, such as the SBP; major changes to the formula for determining meal equivalence; or major shift in
     responsibilities for the LEA/FSMC staff.
     Economic price adjustment - subject to the percent change in the CPI. The specific CPI must be used for all additional fees
     requested by the FSMC. Contract management would require that the LEA verifies all increase/decrease in price
     adjustment.



  Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, November 2019                                                         14
  4.    The FSMC shall cooperate with the LEA in promoting nutrition education and coordinating the LEA’s food service with
        classroom instructions.
  5.    The LEA reserves the right to maintain present food and beverage vending machines in its facilities.
  6.    The FSMC will be required to use the LEA’s point of sale software. Information regarding the software will be available at the
        pre-bid conference.
  7.    The FSMC shall be an independent contractor and not an employee of the LEA. The employees of the FSMC shall not be
        employees of the LEA.
  8.    The FSMC shall provide additional food service, such as banquets, parties, refreshments for meetings, etc, as requested by
        the LEA. The LEA or requesting organization will be billed for the actual cost of food, supplies, labor, and the FSMC’s
        overhead and administrative expense if applicable to providing such service. USDA donated foods shall not be used for
        these special functions.
  9.    This contract constitutes the entire agreement between the LEA and the FSMC and may not be changed, extended orally, or
        altered by cause of conduct.
  10. No provision of this contract shall be assigned or subcontracted without prior written consent of the LEA.
  11. Any agreement between the LEA and the FSMC shall be subject to approval by the SA.


Duration and Termination
  1.    This contract shall be for duration of no longer than one year; and options for the yearly renewal of a contract may not
        exceed four (4) additional years. (7 CFR 210.16(d))

  2.    Either party may cancel for cause with 60 day notification. (7CFR 210.16(d))

  3.    Any amendment, addendum, and/or renewal to the contract shall become effective at the time specified and must be sent
        to the SA.

  4.    Neither the FSMC nor the LEA shall be responsible for any losses resulting if the fulfillment of the terms of the contract is
        delayed or prevented by wars, acts of public enemies, strikes, fires, floods, acts of God, or any other acts which could not
        have been prevented by the exercise of due diligence.

  5.    Ensure that the SA has reviewed and approved contract terms and that the LEA has incorporated all SA required changes
        into the contract or amendment before any contract or amendment to an existing FSMC contract is executed. Any changes
        made by the LEA or FSMC to a SA pre-approved prototype contract or SA approved contract term must be approved in
        writing by the SA before the contract is executed. When requested, the LEA must submit all procurement documents,
        including responses submitted by potential contractors, to the SA, by the due date established by the SA.
        (7 CFR 210.16(a)(10))

 Fixed Price Financial Agreements

   1.   Meal equivalent factor to be used is mandated by the SA. The LEA will require the FSMC to convert all receipts from cash or a
        la carte sales to equivalent meals and charges to LEA made at the student lunch contract rate according to the following
        formula:


        Amount LEA is to be billed for a la carte program = (total a la carte sales) / (meal equivalent factor) (X) fixed price per meal.


        Example: a la carte revenue $100,000 / (divide) meal equivalent factor (mandated by SA) 3.75= (equals) meal equivalents 26,667
        meal equivalents 26,667 X (times) fixed price per meal (mandated by SA) $2.00 = (equals) charge to LEA by FSMC $53,334.




                                                                                                                                            15
Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, November 2019
  2.   Meal equivalent factors shall be utilized in determining equivalent meals for a la carte sales and sales accruing from a LEA sponsored
       catered events.

  3.   For outside catered events not directly invoiced to the LEA the meal equivalent factor will be utilized to determine the appropriate
       credit to the LEA.

  4.   The fixed price must include all labor (including bonuses, if any) and expenses as shown below. They may not be charged back to
       the LEA in any other manner.
                  • Menu development specific to the operation
                  • Nutrition education materials and program expense
                  • Design services specific to the operation
                  • Education program via assembly programs, school room programs, parent/teacher meetings, and school food
                       advisory committee meetings
                  • Personal representation, visitation, and coverage on a regular basis by a principle ofFSMC
                  • All accounting
                  • All payroll costs and documentation
                  • Administrative dietetic, nutritional, sanitation, and personnel advice
                  • All costs incurred in hiring and relocating, if necessary, the FSMC management team
                  • All training costs for FSMC employees
                  • All miscellaneous costs to operate the program; i.e., consumable marketing materials
                  • One-time performance bond

  5.   The FSMC shall submit an invoice to the LEA weekly based upon the actual number of meals served during that calendar week, or
       monthly based upon the actual number of meals served during the calendar month multiplied by the daily rates for the total
       billing.

  6.   The LEA’s failure to pay as invoiced shall constitute a breach of the contract. In the event any invoice is unpaid for more than 45
       days, the FSMC shall have the right upon ten (10) days written notice to terminate performance under this contract. The LEA
       further agrees to pay all costs of collection of amounts due including a reasonable attorney’s fee. Waiver by FSMC of the right
       to terminate for one or more late payments shall not constitute waiver of FSMC’s rights for future last payments.

  7.   Fixed price per meal contracts awarded on a per meal basis and revenues from nonprogram foods sales converted into meal
       equivalents to which the fixed price cost is applied, the FSMC will annually provide infromation on food costs and revenues. The
       information must include food cost for reimbursable meals, food cost for non-program foods, revenue from non-program foods,
       and total revenue. Nonprogram foods include: a la carte; catering; vending; and student stores operated, or any other sales
       generated through the nonprofit school food service account not already described. This information is used to determine
       compliance with revenue from nonprogram foods a 7 CFR 201.14(f).

 Professional Standards for Local School Nutrition Personnel

  The final rule seeks to insure that local school nutrition personnel in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs have the
  knowledge and skills to manage and operate the programs correctly and successfully. The training standards apply to contract
  employees that are involved in the management or operation of the school nutrition programs, regardless of the contract duration. The
  LEA must request documentation from the FSMC to show compliance with the annual training standards.

  Training standards do not apply to a vended meal provider commercial entity off-site from the school food service that provided pre
  plated meals. However, the LEA director must insure that vendors providing meals for the school nutrition programs have the
  knowledge and skills to supply safe and nutritious meals that meet the meal patterns and dietary specifications.

 Contracting with small and minority businesses, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms (2 CFR 200.321)

  (a) The non-Federal entity must take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority businesses, women's business
  enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when possible.

             she is otherwise entitled. The non-Federal entity must report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal awarding
             agency.




                                                                                                                                      22

Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, November 2019
         2. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701–3708). Where applicable, all contracts awarded by the
            non-Federal entity in excess of $100,000 that involve the employment of mechanics or laborers must include a provision
            for compliance with 40 U.S.C. 3702 and 3704, as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5).
            Under 40U.S.C. 3702 of the Act, each contractor must be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer
            on the basis of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible provided that
            the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than one and a half times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in
            excess of 40 hours in the work week. The requirements of 40 U.S.C. 3704 are applicable to construction work and
            provide that no laborer or mechanic must be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are
            unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or
            articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of intelligence.

         3. Rights to Inventions Made Under a Contract or Agreement. If the Federal award meets the definition of
            ‘‘fundingagreement’’ under 37 CFR § 401.2 (a) and the recipient or sub-recipient wishes to enter into a contract with a
            small business firm or nonprofit organization regarding the substitution of parties, assignment or performance of
            experimental,developmental, or research work under that ‘‘funding 21 agreement,’’ the recipient or sub-recipient must
            comply with the requirements of 37 CFR Part 401, ‘‘Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small
            Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements,’’ and any implementing regulations
            issued by the awarding agency.

         4. Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401–7671q.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33U.S.C. 1251–1387), as amended
            Contracts and sub grants of amounts in excess of $150,000 must contain a provision that requires the non-Federal award
            to agree to comply with all applicable standards, orders or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act (42
            U.S.C.7401–7671q) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended (33 U.S.C.1251–1387). Violations must be
            reported to the Federal awarding agency and the Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

         5. Equal Employment Opportunity. Except as otherwise provided under 41 CFR Part 60, all contracts that meet the
            definition of ‘‘federally assisted construction contract’’ in 41 CFR Part 60–1.3 must include the equal opportunity clause
            provided under 41 CFR 60–1.4(b), in accordance with Executive Order 11246, ‘‘Equal Employment Opportunity’’ (30 FR
            12319, 12935, 3 CFR Part, 1964–1965 Comp., p. 339), as amended by Executive Order 11375, ‘‘Amending Executive
            Order 11246 Relating to Equal Employment Opportunity,’’ and implementing regulations at 41 CFR part 60, ‘‘Office of
            Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor.’’

         6. Debarment and Suspension (Executive Orders 12549 and 12689)—A contract award (see 2 CFR 180.220) must not be
            made to parties listed on the government wide exclusions in the System for Award Management (SAM), in accordance
            with the OMB guidelines at 2 CFR 180 that implement Executive Orders 12549 (3 CFR part 1986 Comp., p.189)and 12689
           (3 CFR part 1989 Comp., p. 235), ‘‘Debarment and Suspension.’’ SAM Exclusions contains the names of parties debarred,
           suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, as well as parties declared ineligible under statutory or regulatory
           authority other than Executive Order 12549.

         7. Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352)—Contractors that apply or bid for an award exceeding
            $100,000 must file the required certification. Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not and has not used Federal
            appropriated funds to pay any person or organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee
            of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in
            connection with obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 U.S.C. 1352. Each tier must also
            disclose any lobbying with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. Such
            disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the non-Federal award.

             do not otherwise meet the requirements of the contract. (7CFR 210.16(c)(3))

        5.   The FSMC must not directly or indirectly restrict the sale or marketing of fluid milk at any time or in any place on school

             materials of the FSMC, including menus, recipes, signage, food service surveys and studies, management guidelines
             and procedures, operating manuals, software (both owned by and licensed by the FSMC), and similar compilations
             regularly used in FSMC business operations (trade secrets). The LEA shall not disclose any of the FSMC’s trade secrets
             or other confidential information, directly or indirectly, during or after the term of the contract. The LEA shall not

             FSMC immediately upon termination of the contract. The LEA shall not use any confusingly similar names, marks,

              SA and USDA shall have unrestricted rights.

          13. The FSMC certifies that it and its principals are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment,

 Buy American

 The Buy American provision for contracts that involve the purchase of food, as required by the Buy American provision, all products
 must be of domestic origin as required by 7 CFR Part 210.21(d).
         i)    The LEA participates in the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program and is required to use the
               nonprofit food service funds, to the maximum extent practical, to buy domestic commodities or products for Program
               meals. A “domestic commodity or product” is defined as one that is either produced in the U.S. or is processed in the
               U.S. substantially using agricultural commodities that are produced in the U.S. as provided in 7 CFR Part 210.21(d).

         ii)   Exceptions to the Buy American provision should be used as a last resort; however, an alternative or exception may be
               approved upon request. To be considered for the alternative or exception, the request must be submitted in writing to
               SFA and approved and will be retained with purchase records. The request must include the:

               (1) Alternative substitute (s) that are domestic and meet the required specifications:

                   (a) Price of the domestic food alternative substitute (s); and

                   (b) Availability of the domestic alternative substitute (s) in relation to the quantity ordered.

               (2) Reason for exception: limited/lack of availability or price (include price):

                   (a) Price of the domestic food product; and

                   (b) Price of the non-domestic product that meets the required specification of the domestic product.




                                                                                                                                        24
Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, November 2019
Geographic Preference
LEAs may apply a geographic preference when procuring unprocessed locally grown or locally raised agricultural products. When
utilizing geographic preference to procure such products, the LEA making the purchase has the discretion to determine the local area
to which the geographic preference option will be applied; For the purpose of applying the optional geographic procurement
preference, “unprocessed locally grown or locally raised agricultural products” means only those agricultural products that retain
their inherent character. The effects of the following food handling and preservation techniques shall not be considered as changing
an agricultural product into a product of a different kind or character: Cooling; refrigerating; freezing; size adjustment made by
peeling, slicing, dicing, cutting, chopping, shucking, and grinding; forming ground products into patties without any additives or fillers;
drying/dehydration; washing; packaging (such as placing eggs in cartons), vacuum packing and bagging (such as placing vegetables in
bags or combining two or more types of vegetables or fruits in a single package); the addition of ascorbic acid or other preservatives
to prevent oxidation of produce; butchering livestock and poultry; cleaning fish; and the pasteurization of milk. (7CFR210.21).
Locally Grown

The FSMC, as the agent of the LEA, will maximize the use of Missouri (MO) grown/locally grown products, included but not limited to,
fruits, vegetables and dairy products, whenever possible, and when purchased by the LEA directly, such fruits, vegetables, and dairy
products must be used by the FSMC in the SFA's Food Service Program.

The FSMC shall engage in MO's Farm-to-School initiative in an effort to connect schools (K-12) with MO/local farms in order to serve
healthy meals using locally grown produced foods.

The FSMC shall produce a monthly report with documents the procurement of MO grow/locally products including the local farm
source, the product(s) purchased and the value of the products purchased on behalf of the LEA.

Department of Defense Produce

The LEA, at its discretion, may procure fresh produce through the USDA Department of Defense (DOD) contracts utilizing commodity
entitlement dollars. The LEA may use another vendor for these items at their discretion.

Civil Rights

          In accordance with Federal civil rights law and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) civil rights regulations
          and policies, the USDA, its Agencies, offices, and employees, and institutions participating in or
          administering USDA programs are prohibited from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, sex,
          disability, age, or reprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights activity in any program or activity conducted or
          funded by USDA.

          Persons with disabilities who require alternative means of communication for program information (e.g.
          Braille, large print, audiotape, American Sign Language, etc.), should contact the Agency (State or local)
          where they applied for benefits. Individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech disabilities may
          contact USDA through the Federal Relay Service at (800) 877-8339. Additionally, program information may
          be made available in languages other than English.
