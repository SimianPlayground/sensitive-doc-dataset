                    Employee Direct Deposit Enrollment Form
To enroll in Full Service Direct Deposit, simply complete this form and submit to your Staffing
Representative. Attach a voided check or direct deposit letter from your bank for each
checking/savings account listed – not a deposit slip.



Important! Please read and sign before completing and submitting.

I hereby authorize The Houston Jackson Group (hereinafter “Employer”), either directly or through its
payroll service provider, to deposit any amounts owed to me, by initiating credit entries to my account at the
financial institution (hereinafter “Bank”) indicated on this form. Further, I authorize Bank to accept and to
credit any credit entries indicated by Employer, either directly or through its payroll service provider, to my
account. In the event that Employer deposits funds erroneously into my account, I authorize Employer,
either directly or through its payroll service provider, to debit my account for an amount not to exceed the
original amount of the erroneous credit.
This authorization is to remain in full force and effect until Employer and Bank have received written notice
from me of its termination in such time and in such manner as to afford Employer and Bank reasonable
opportunity to act on it.
