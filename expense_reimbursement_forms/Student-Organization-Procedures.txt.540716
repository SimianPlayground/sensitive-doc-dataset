Paying an individual speaker/performer/or group/business:

     1) The Student Club Business Office will need the following if we are paying an individual:
           a. An Independent Contract Form will need to be filled out with original signatures
               from the speaker/performer: http://www.unco.edu/purchasing/accounts-
               payable/hiring-independent-contractors.aspx The form is located under Helpful
               Links
           b. A W-9 will need to be filled out if they have not been hired by UNC before; either
               with a social security number (individual) or an EIN (group or business)

Reimbursing individuals for Club Purchases:

If you make purchases for your club with your own funds reimbursement can be made, as long as
you have club approval. A Request for Reimbursement form will need to be filled out with two
signatures from the club before we can process the reimbursement. The person being reimbursed
cannot be one of the signatures on the form.

Student Travel (Club Travel, GSA Grants, and AEC Grants):

The Student Club Business Office can assist clubs with their travel arrangements. Most airfare is
paid out-of-pocket by the student, however, if a club is covering part of the cost then
reimbursement can be made. When this happens, the student needs to submit a Work Copy prior
to making their travel arrangements. After travel is complete they will return their receipts to the
Student Business Office and expenses will be reallocated into the appropriate Club FOAP.

If a student received a GSA or Senate grant they will bring the signed copy of their award letter
along with their receipts to the Student Club Business Office be reimbursed from the appropriate
fund.

Vehicle Rental / UNC Motor Pool:

To reserve a motor pool vehicle a student or staff calls Motor Pool (Michael Stadler: 351-1243)
to check if a vehicle is available. If there is a vehicle available, you will come to the Student
Club Business Office to take care of the paperwork.
