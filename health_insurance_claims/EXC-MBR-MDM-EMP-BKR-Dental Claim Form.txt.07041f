NATIONAL PROVIDER IDENTIFIER (NPI)
49 and 54  NPI (National Provider Indentifier): This is an identifier assigned by the Federal government to all providers considered to be HlPAA
           covered entities. An NPI is unique to an individual dentist (Type 1 NPI) or dental entity (Type 2 NPI), and has no intrinsic meaning.
           Additional information on NPI and enumeration can be obtained from the ADA's Internet Web Site: www.ada.org/goto/npi

ADDITIONAL PROVIDER IDENTIFIER
52A and 58 Additional Provider ID: This is an identifier assigned to the billing dentist or dental entity other than a Social Security Number (SSN)
            or Tax Identification Number (TIN). It is not the provider's NPI. The additional identifier is sometimes referred to as a Legacy
            Identifier (LID). LIDs may not be unique as they are assigned by different entities (e.g., third-party payer; Federal government). Some
            Legacy IDs have an intrinsic meaning.
