CLAIM SUBMISSION REMINDERS:
• Credit card statements, cancelled checks and balance forward/prior balance statements are not acceptable.
• The service being claimed must be provided to you or a qualifying individual within the time frame indicated in your Plan Highlights.
• In general, IRS regulations do not require that you pay for a service before requesting reimbursement. A request for reimbursement must be based on the date when the service was
  provided, not the date when a payment was made. (The IRS allows one exception: orthodontia expenses can be based on date of payment, date of service or payment due date on
  statements/coupons.)
• Claims must be submitted after a service is provided, but before the end of the run-out period following the end of your plan year.
• Claims must be received by Benefit Resource, Inc. within the time frames specified in the Plan Highlights.
• An expense paid with the Beniversal Card or that has been reimbursed from any other source cannot be submitted for reimbursement.
• Items on a claim form or supporting documentation should never be highlighted since highlighted items can be hard to read.
