Mental Health / Substance Abuse Treatment Claim Form
DIRECTIONS FOR COMPLETION
If you are in treatment with a non-participating Beacon Health Options, Inc. (Beacon) provider and your
provider has indicated that you will be responsible to file your claim, please take this claim form with you to
your visit.
In order to facilitate payment of your claim, please be sure that Parts I and II are completed in their entirety.
An explanation of each field is provided below. The fields in BOLD lettering are required in order for the
claim to be considered for payment.

You must complete Part I in its entirety.

Your provider must complete Part II in its entirety. Even if your provider provides you with their custom
claim form, Beacon requires that they complete Box 7 under Part II. If you are unable to get the signature of
the provider, please print his/her name in Box 7, Part II. Please be sure that as much of Part II is completed
as possible. You may attach your provider’s custom claim form for our review.
Please make every effort to have this form printed in red ink. Please use a black ballpoint pen when filling in
the required fields. This allows the claim to be scanned through technology that expedites the claims
payment process. (However, black and white forms are accepted.)
