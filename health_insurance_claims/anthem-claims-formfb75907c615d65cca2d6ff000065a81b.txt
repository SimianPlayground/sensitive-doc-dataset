Dear Member:

Usually, all providers of health care will bill us for services to you and your enrolled dependents. This is the preferred procedure. You are not
bothered with claim forms and we often need more details than are ordinarily provided on bills to patients.

Sometimes, a physician may not bill us, or an ambulance company, for example, may send the bill directly to you. In either instance, we have
no way of knowing about your claim. This Member Claim Form was developed to notify us of any covered health service for which we have not
already been billed. Please read the following instructions about how to report Health Care Services.

We are happy to serve you.
