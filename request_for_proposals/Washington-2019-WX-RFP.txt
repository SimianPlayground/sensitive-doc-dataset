1. INTRODUCTION
   1.1.   PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND

   The Washington State Department of Commerce hereafter called "COMMERCE,” is initiating this
   Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals from firms interested in participating in a project to
   administer a Low-Income Weatherization (WX) Program in Washington for the following territories:

                    1. Klickitat County
                    2. Skamania County

   The State of Washington, through the Washington State Department of Commerce (COM), Housing
   Improvements and Preservation (HIP) Unit, intends to use the results of this Request for Proposal
   (RFP) to select a qualified grantee(s) to provide weatherization services. Grantee(s) will be selected
   through the process dictated by state and federal laws and procurement practices, and must be a
   Washington-based local public or private non-profit agency, Community Action Agency, or unit of local
   government. The purpose of the weatherization program is to:

                   Increase energy efficiency of dwellings owned or occupied by low-income persons,
                    (especially low-income persons who meet one of the following: elderly, persons with
                    disabilities, families with young children, high residential energy users, and
                    households with high energy burden);
                   Reduce household energy expenditures: and
                   Address identified health and safety concerns within the scope of the program.

   During the 2019 contract period (July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019), approximately $24 million in funding
   was available and 2,000 units are expected to be weatherized in the State of Washington.

   Funding for Program Year (PY) 2019 (April 1, 2019 - September 30, 2020) will be allocated by county
   based on a formula allocation plan that takes into account eligible population and heating and cooling
   degree days as designated by Commerce. The following chart offers information on funding and
   production estimated for PY 2020 that can be used for reference when writing this proposal. Klickitat
   and Skamania Counties have historically been served as one region, the chart below reflects this:

   COMMERCE intends to award one/multiple contract(s) to provide the services described in this RFP.

   1.2.   OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF WORK

   COMMERCE is soliciting Applications from which to select provider(s) of weatherization services to
   low-income households located in the above-referenced territories in Washington. Said services will be
   performed in accordance with the regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in 10
   CFR 440 and the Uniform Administrative Guidance as outlined in 2 CFR 200, and in accordance with
   the provisions and procedures contained in the Washington State Weatherization Policy and
   Procedures Manual and the Standard Work Specifications (SWS).

   COMMERCE intends to select a qualified provider(s) to enter into an initial grant agreement for Program
   Year2019. The contract period for the chosen qualified provider(s) will be from April 1, 2019 to
   September 31, 2019. Additional grant agreements may follow contingent upon grantee performance

   Annual funding for the State of Washington Weatherization (WX) Program is derived from four separate
   funding sources: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and U.S. Department of Health and Human
   Services (HHS), Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and Washington State’s Matchmaker (MM)
   Program. Budget allocations are made per county using a formula allocation method and are subject
   to change. Total allocation(s) will be made based on actual grant amount for PY 2020. Grant
   agreements signed by grantees will reflect actual funding and scope of work. COMMERCE reserves
   the right to further negotiate the terms and conditions of the grant with the selected provider(s).

   The provision of weatherization services includes all aspects of managing and implementing the WX
   Program. The selected grantee(s) shall be responsible for client intake and eligibility determinations,
   determining the weatherization and health and safety needs of each unit, conducting valid energy
   audits, installation of weatherization measures, conducting quality control final inspections, and fulfilling
   all necessary reporting requirements. In addition, the initial inspection/energy audit and final inspection
   must not be completed by the same staff person, although there is a waiver process available for
   providers that are unable to comply with this separation requirement. Final inspections must be
   completed by a Home Energy Performance Quality Control Inspector. Proposals should allow for this
   separation of duties and must show proof that final inspectors meet this credential.

   Services provided under the weatherization program include but are not limited to insulation of attics,
   walls, and floors; heating system tune-up, repair, or replacement; water heater repair or replacement;
   air sealing; mechanical ventilation; and other repairs necessary to address identified health and safety
   concerns, as allowable.

   Organizations providing Low-Income Weatherization must maintain a good working relationship with
   local utilities providing service in the area being served. Partners for the territory served by this RFP
   include Northwest Natural Gas and Avista. Additionally, organizations will work collaboratively with the
   Energy Project to further program goals and leverage state and federal dollars as a result of those
   relationships.


   1.3    MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

   Minimum qualifications include:
        Licensed to do business in the State of Washington or provide a commitment that provider will
         become licensed in Washington within thirty (30) calendar days of being selected as the
         Apparently Successful Contractor.
        Must be a local public or private non-profit agency, Community Action Agency, or unit of local
         government based in Washington or a neighboring state.
        Experience with providing weatherization services to low-income households.

   The final determination of the protest shall:
          Find the protest lacking in merit and uphold COMMERCE’S action; or

           COMMERCE to be in substantial compliance and reject the protest; or
          Find merit in the protest and provide COMMERCE options which may include:

     Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) Weatherization Assistance Program Grant (WAP)


1.   AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE
     This grant is made available under the provisions of the Human Services Amendments of 1994 (Public Law
     103-252) reauthorized the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) through fiscal year 1999.
     The Coats Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998, Public Law 105-285, subsequently reauthorized the
     program through FY 2004. Public Law 103-252 allows the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
     to permit LIHEAP grantees to follow Department of Energy (DOE) rules applicable to the DOE Low Income
     Weatherization Assistance Program (LIWAP) when spending LIHEAP funds for weatherization activities.
     Washington State Department of Commerce (Commerce) requested to follow DOE rules in the 2016 LIHEAP
     State Plan with minimum exceptions. Refer to the Wx Manual for additional guidance.
     The purpose of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is to help keep families safe and
     healthy through initiatives that assist families with energy costs. Federal funding assistance in managing
     costs are associated with home energy bills, energy crises, and weatherization and energy-related minor
     home repairs.
     The Washington State Department of Commerce (Commerce), Energy Division, Housing Improvements
     and Preservation administer these funds through local agencies to provide administration and delivery
     of low-income weatherization services to eligible homes.
2.   BILLING PROCEDURES AND PAYMENT
     The Grantee payment is based on monthly reimbursement in the amount of actual expenditures from the
     previous month. No payment will be made until Commerce receives an accurate and complete request for
     reimbursement through the Contract Management System (CMS) Online A19s Portal. Grantee must submit
     their requests for reimbursement with verified electronic signature on or before the 15th of every month for
     the previous month’s expenditures. If there was no production or fiscal activity during the previous month
     the Grantee must still submit a monthly request for reimbursement showing a zero balance.
     The Grantee may request an initial working capital advance one month prior to the planned expenditure.
     The advance cannot exceed the Grantee’s planned expenditures for the first sixty days’
     Administration/Program or ten percent (10%) of the total Administration/Program.
     In any given year, all outstanding local agency advance amounts must be applied to allowable program
     costs on the June request for reimbursement and submitted to Commerce no later than July 15th.
     Outstanding advance amounts not cleared by July 15th will be billed to the local agency for payment.
     The Grantee shall submit a Final Grant Closeout Report for each funding source that accurately reflects the
     work completed and funds expended during the program year. The Grantee shall submit electronic reports
     to Commerce no later than 45 days after the program year closes. Exception: local agencies may submit
     hard copy reports. Grantee must submit the complete list of Weatherization Information Data System
     (WIDS) project numbers the Grant funded.
     Payments under this Grant may be suspended if the Final Grant Closeout Report and Request
     for Reimbursement for the prior year Grant are not received by the due date.
     Commerce may, in its sole discretion, terminate the Grant or withhold payments claimed by the Grantee
     for services rendered if the Grantee fails to satisfactorily comply with any term or condition of this Grant.
     ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ALLOCATION
     Allowable administrative costs actually incurred in operating activities funded under this Grant may
     be charged to this Grant.
     Administrative services shared by other programs shall be assigned to this Grant based on an allocation
     plan that reflects allowable administrative costs that support services provided under each Grant
     administered by Commerce. An approved current federal indirect cost rate may be applied up to the
     maximum administrative budget allowed.
     ALLOWABLE COSTS
  For allowable use of program funds refer to the Weatherization Manual.

BUDGET REVISIONS
The approved budget is included on the Grant Face Sheet/Amendment Face Sheet, and Attachment B-Budget.
The Grantee may transfer up to and including a cumulative total less than or equal to five percent (5%) of
the sum of all Program Operations categories among approved Budget line items. Budget revisions in
excess of five percent (5%) must be submitted to Commerce in writing with a Weatherization Grant
Budget Change Request Form (email acceptable) and approved by Commerce before local agencies submit
expenditure reports reflecting the revisions. The Grantee must provide the previously approved budgets
(most recent budget or previously approved Grant Budget Change Request Form) and the proposed
changes to the appropriate Commerce Weatherization Program Manager. Refer to the Weatherization
Manual for additional guidance.
DISALLOWED COSTS
The Grantee is responsible for any audit exceptions or disallowed costs incurred by its own organization
or that of its Contractors/Subcontractors.
PROGRAM INCOME
Program income generated under this Grant may be used for costs not included in the total approved
budget, if Commerce determines such costs are directly related to the objectives of the statute under
which the grant was awarded. Such program income shall be used in the manner and in accordance with
the terms and conditions established by the grant through which the program income was derived unless
otherwise permitted by Commerce.
PROPORTIONAL RETURN OF UNEXPENDED FUNDS
A Grantee who returns unexpended funds to Commerce at the end of the Grant period shall return
administrative and program operation funds in proportion to the Grant award unless Grant spending limits
are more restrictive. In the case of more restrictive spending limits, the spending limits shall apply.
REDUCTION IN FUNDS
If funding from the state, federal government, or other source is withdrawn, reduced, reallocated, or
limited, after the effective date of this Grant and prior to normal completion, Commerce may immediately
and unilaterally terminate the Grant, withdraw funding, or renegotiate the Grant subject to those new
funding limitations and conditions. Commerce shall promptly notify the Grantee of such termination,
withdrawal of funds, or intent to renegotiate the Grant. If the source of funding for this Grant is eliminated
on a temporary or permanent basis, Commerce will not be responsible for reimbursing the Grantee for any
work performed after the receipt of the notification.
Failure of the Grantee to meet performance standards, production projections, or comply with federal or
state requirements may result in reduction of funds.
REQUIRED DOCUMENTS
