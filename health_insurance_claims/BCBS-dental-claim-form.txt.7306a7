3. The patient (or parent, if the patient is a minor) must sign the “Authorization to Release Information”.

4. If total charges for the planned course of treatment can reasonably be expected to be $300 or more, it is recommended that a pre-treatment estimate
   be submitted prior to the commencement of the course of treatment. Blue Cross will notify you and your dentist of benefits payable.

     Estimated benefits are subject to your coverage being in force at time services are performed and are subject to the specific limitations and exclusions
     listed in your benefit plan.

     Please refer to your Certificate of Coverage for a description of covered services, percentage of fees payable, limitations and exclusions.
