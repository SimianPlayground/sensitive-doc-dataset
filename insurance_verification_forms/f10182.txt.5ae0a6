 SECTION 5 – SIGNATURE
 Please read the following statements before signing. If you don’t understand any part of this application, contact your
 agency.
 Under penalties of law and/or perjury, I declare I have read and understand this application and any attachments and to
 the best of my knowledge, the information I have given is true, correct and complete. I understand the penalties for giving
 false information or breaking the rules. I understand I will have to provide proof that what I have said is true. I understand I
 will have to repay any benefits paid on my behalf that are issued incorrectly due to my failure to report changes or provide
 complete and correct information.

 I understand my rights as well as my responsibilities and agree to abide by them.

 I know that federal rules state any information I have given must be reviewed and verified by state staff. Also, I understand
 that I must cooperate fully with state and federal workers if my case is reviewed. No additional permission by me is
 needed to get any proof or other information.

 I know that BadgerCare Plus does not pay medical costs that a third party, such as a private health insurance company or
 someone who injures me, is supposed to pay. I therefore assign and give my rights to any payments from a liable third
 party to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services up to the payment amount that BadgerCare Plus has made for my
 medical care. This assignment applies to any of my minor children. These payments may include payments from hospital
 and health insurance policies or payments received as a settlement from an accident.

 I understand that my signature authorizes the local agency and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services to request
 any information that is appropriate and necessary for the proper administration of BadgerCare Plus as authorized under
 Wisconsin law.

 I understand that if I do not meet the rules to enroll in BadgerCare Plus and/or Medicaid, the agency may send my
 information to the federal Health Insurance Marketplace. The Marketplace will use this information to see if I can get help
 with paying for private health insurance.

at grocery stores that accept FoodShare.

benefits within seven days if you qualify for immediate help.

religious creed, national origin, or political beliefs.

   perjury, that all your answers are true and correct.
• Providing proof of all information needed to determine eligibility.

COLLECTION OF INFORMATION / USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS / PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
The collection of this information, including the Social Security number of each household member, is authorized
under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 2011-2036. The information will be used to
determine whether your household is eligible or continues to be eligible to participate in SNAP. We will verify this
information through computer matching programs. This information will also be used to monitor compliance with
program regulations and for program management.
The information will be used to determine if your household can get or keep getting benefits.
Information you give will be verified through computer matching programs. This information will also be used to
monitor compliance with program rules and for program management.
This information may be disclosed to other federal and state agencies for official examination and to law
enforcement officials for the purpose of apprehending persons fleeing to avoid the law.
If a SNAP claim arises against your household, the information on this application, including all Social Security
numbers, may be referred to federal and state agencies, as well as private claims collection agencies, for claims
collection action.
Providing the requested information, including the Social Security numbers of each household member, is
voluntary. However, failure to provide a Social Security number will result in the denial of SNAP benefits to each
individual failing to provide a Social Security number. Any Social Security numbers provided will be used and
disclosed in the same manner as Social Security numbers of eligible household members.
Your Social Security number will not be shared with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services
(USCIS).
IMMIGRATION STATUS
To be able to get FoodShare, you must be a U.S. citizen or have qualifying immigration status with USCIS. Immigration
status of all individuals applying for FoodShare will be verified with USCIS and may affect FoodShare enrollment and
benefits. Immigration status will not be verified with USCIS for any individual who is not applying for FoodShare or who
indicates he or she does not have qualifying immigration status with USCIS. However, income from those individuals
may affect FoodShare enrollment or benefits.
QUALITY CONTROL REVIEW
Your FoodShare case may be randomly selected by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services for a quality control
review. A FoodShare quality control review is a review of your FoodShare case to make sure the agency that enrolled you
in FoodShare issued your benefits correctly and is following the rules set by the federal government. Federal law states
FOODSHARE WISCONSIN REGISTRATION
F-16019A
Page 5 of 8

that you must cooperate with the quality control review. If you do not give the information requested and do not cooperate
with the review, your FoodShare case may be closed. If this happens, you will be told how long your case may be closed.
WORK REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS AGES 16 THROUGH 59
All FoodShare applicants and members ages 16 through 59 must be registered for work unless they are considered
exempt. You will be registered for work at the time you are determined eligible for FoodShare unless you meet an
exemption.
You meet an exemption from the work registration requirements if any of the following is true:
• You are 16 or 17 years old and are not the primary person in the FoodShare group.
• You are 16 or 17 years old and are the primary person in the FoodShare group but are enrolled in school or in an
   employment and training program at least half time.
• You are found to be unfit for work. This applies if:
   o You get temporary or permanent disability benefits from the government or a private source.
   o You are found to be mentally or physically unable to work by your agency.
   o You are verified as unable to work by a statement from a health care professional or social worker.
• You are enrolled in W-2 and complying with the W-2 work requirements.
• You are the primary caregiver for a dependent child younger than age 6 (whether the child lives in your home or out
   of your home). However, if you and another person both have parental control of the child, only one of you can be
   exempt from the work registration requirements as the primary caregiver of that child.
• You are the primary caregiver for another person who cannot care for himself or herself (whether the person lives in
   your home or out of your home).
• You have applied for or are receiving unemployment compensation.
• You are regularly taking part in an alcohol or other drug abuse treatment or rehabilitation program.
• You are working 30 or more hours per week or earning wages equal to 30 or more hours per week at the federal
   minimum wage.
• You are enrolled at least half time in a recognized school, training program, or institution of higher education.
You may need to provide proof to your agency if you meet one of these exemptions. Although registration for work is
required, taking part in a work program is voluntary.
WORK REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT SANCTION
If you do not comply with the work registration requirements and you do not meet an exemption, you will not be able to
get FoodShare benefits for a specified sanction period. This includes if you voluntarily and without good cause do any of
the following:
• Turn down a suitable job offer
• Quit a job of 30 or more hours per week (or a job with earnings equal to 30 hours per week at the federal minimum
    wage)
• Reduce your work hours to less than 30 hours per week (or your earnings to less than 30 times the federal minimum
    wage)
• Take part in W-2 but do not meet the W-2 program work requirements
• Apply for or get unemployment benefits but do not meet the unemployment compensation program work
    requirements
If, during the sanction period, you move to another FoodShare household, the remainder of your sanction period will
transfer with you to that household. The length of a sanction period is:
• One month for the first sanction.
• Three months for the second sanction.
• Six months for the third or subsequent sanctions.
You can end a sanction period early if you become exempt from the work registration requirements.
You will need to reapply for FoodShare if you want to get benefits after the sanction period ends. If you are part of a
FoodShare group, you will need to let your worker know to update your case instead of having to reapply.

WORK REQUIREMENT FOR ABLE-BODIED ADULTS AGES 18 THROUGH 49
Certain adults ages 18 through 49 with no minor children living in the home may only get three months of time-limited
FoodShare benefits in a 36-month (three-year) period unless they meet the FoodShare work requirement or are considered
exempt. This work requirement is different from the work registration requirement.
There are three ways to meet the work requirement:
1. Work at least 80 hours each month.
2. Take part in an allowable work program at least 80 hours each month, such as:
   • FoodShare Employment and Training (FSET).
   • W-2.
   • Certain programs under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).
3. Both work and take part in an allowable work program for a combined total of at least 80 hours each month.
You will get information about the FSET program if you are enrolled in FoodShare.
You may be considered exempt and may not need to meet the work requirement if any of the following is true:
• You are living with a child under age 18 who is part of the same FoodShare household.
• You are the primary caregiver for a person who cannot care for himself or herself.
• You are the primary caregiver for a dependent child under age 6.
• You are physically or mentally unable to work. This includes being homeless long term. Being homeless long term
   means you will not have a regular place to stay for the next 30 nights.
• You are pregnant.
• You are receiving or have applied for unemployment insurance.
• You are taking part in an alcohol or other drug abuse (AODA) treatment or rehabilitation program.
• You are enrolled in an institution of higher learning at least half-time.
• You are age 18 or older attending high school at least half-time.
• You are enrolled in W-2 and complying with W-2 requirements.
• You are working 30 or more hours per week or are earning wages equal to 30 or more hours per week at the federal
   minimum wage.
• You are living in an unemployment exemption county or are a tribal member living on tribal land or a reservation that
   has an unemployment exemption. These areas have an unemployment rate higher than the national average. For a list
   of the unemployment exemption counties and tribal lands or reservations, go to
   www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/fset/exemptions.htm.

    Note: You may need to provide proof that you have an exemption.

SECTION 13 – RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Fair Hearings: I understand I have the right to file a fair hearing request to appeal any action taken concerning my
application or ongoing benefits if I do not agree with that action. I understand I can ask for a fair hearing by writing to:
Department of Administration, Division of Hearings and Appeals, PO Box 7875, Madison, WI 53708-7875 or by
calling 608-266-7709. I may also contact the agency office where I applied and ask for a fair hearing verbally or in
writing. I understand I can refer to the ForwardHealth Enrollment and Benefits handbook (P-00079) for more information.

Rights and Responsibilities: I have received the “Important Information” section of the FoodShare Wisconsin
Application that includes my rights and responsibilities.

Reporting Changes: I understand that failure to report any changes that result in incorrect benefits will mean recovery of
any amounts overpaid and could also lead to prosecution for fraud, which is a felony.

Expenses: I understand that expenses I report, such as shelter, utilities, child care, child support, or medical costs, may
affect the level of FoodShare benefits my household receives. I understand that failure to report or verify an expense
means that I do not want to receive a deduction for this expense.

Income Reduction: I understand that I am not required to report a reduction or loss of income; however, I may be entitled
to a higher FoodShare benefit if I do. I understand that as long as I do not report a reduction in my household’s monthly
income or the loss of any household income, I will not receive any resulting increase in my FoodShare benefit.

Immigration Status: I understand that I and all other persons living in my household who apply for aid must be citizens
or in a satisfactory immigration status in order to receive assistance. I understand that the immigration status of any person
in my household applying for benefits will be verified with USCIS; this information provided to USCIS may affect my
household’s eligibility and amount of benefits. I understand that my status will not be verified with USCIS if I am not
requesting assistance for myself or if I state that I am an immigrant without satisfactory immigration status.

Any person, including any financial institution, credit reporting agency, employer, or educational institution, is authorized
to release this information, according to Wis. Stat. § 49.22 (2) (2m): “The department may request from any person any
information it determines appropriate and necessary for the administration of programs carrying out the purposes of 7USC
2011 to 2029. Any person in this state shall provide this information within seven days after receiving a request under this
subsection.”

I understand the questions and statements on this application form. I understand the penalties for giving false information
or breaking the rules. I certify, under penalty of perjury and false swearing, that all my answers, including information
provided about the citizenship status of each household member applying for benefits, are correct and complete to the best
of my knowledge. I understand and agree to provide documents to prove what I have said. I understand that the local
agency may contact other persons or organizations to obtain the necessary proof of my eligibility and level of benefits.

By signing this application, I am acknowledging that I have read and understand the rights and responsibilities as stated
above.
