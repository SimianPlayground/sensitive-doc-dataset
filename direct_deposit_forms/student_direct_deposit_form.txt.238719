                     Important Information for opening a Card account: To help the federal government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, the USA
                     PATRIOT Act requires all financial institutions and their third parties to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens a Card
                     account. What this means for you: When you open a Card account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us
                     to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.
