To enroll in Direct Deposit, fill out this form and submit to the Payroll Department in the District Office. Provide your Routing and
Account information as noted on your personal checks for each checking account. Do not use the information from your deposit slips.
If depositing to a savings account, ask your bank to give you the Routing/Transit Number for your account. It isn’t always the same
as the number on a savings deposit slip. This will help ensure that you are paid correctly.
Below is a sample check MICR line, detailing where the information necessary to complete this form can be found.




  You may have up to five active accounts at any time. Use a separate enrollment form to report additional accounts.
Account Information Make sure to indicate what kind of account, along with the amount to be deposited if less than your total net paycheck.

written notice from me of its termination in such time and in such manner as to afford the San Diego Community College District
and Bank reasonable opportunity to act on it.
