                                            HIPPA CONSENT FORM

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) provides safeguards to protect your privacy.
Many of the policies have been our practice for years. This form is a “friendly” version. A more complete text
is posted in the office.

Patient information will be kept confidential except as is necessary to provide services or to ensure that all
administrative matters related to your care are handled appropriately. This specifically includes the sharing of
information with other healthcare providers, laboratories, health insurance payers as is necessary and
appropriate for your care. Patient files may be stored in open file racks and will not contain any coding which
identifies a patient’s condition or information which is not already a matter of public record. The normal
course of providing care means that such records may be left, temporarily, in administrative areas such as the
front office, examination room, etc. Those records will not be available to persons other than office staff. You
agree to the normal procedures utilized within the office for the handling of charts, patient records, (PHI,
protected health information) and other documents or information. Record requests can take up to 30 days
with a $35.00 charge assessed to the patient. Requests from physicians will be done at no charge.

We may change, add, delete or modify any of these provisions to better serve the needs of both the practice
and the patient. You have the right to request restrictions in the use of your protected health information and
to request change in certain policies used within the office concerning your PHI. However, we are not
obligated to alter internal policies to conform to your request.

It is the policy of this office to remind patients of their appointments. We may do this by telephone or e-mail.

I, ___________________________________________date_________________do hereby consent and
acknowledge my agreement to the terms set forth in the HIPPA CONSENT FORM and any subsequent
changes in office policy. I understand that this consent shall remain in force from this time forward.
