                            Request for Proposal for Artist’s Services

1. INTRODUCTION

The City of Palo Alto is requesting proposals from qualified professional artists to submit
proposals for the design of a fountain to replace the existing fountain on California Avenue. This
fountain site is located at the end of South California Avenue (near the Caltrain California
Avenue station) at the intersection of California Avenue and Park (Attachment B). The City of
Palo Alto Public Art Commission (PAPAC) has budgeted a maximum of $50,000 for the artist’s
fee. Artist finalists will be selected by the Public Art Commission. Members of the Community
will then be invited to provide feedback on preferences for the final design option. Artist finalist
will be selected by the Public Art Commission after weighing the community’s preference in the
final design option. Artists may be required to either present their proposal at a community
meeting, to a review panel, or develop and submit a detailed rendering or maquette, which will
be supported by a stipend.

2. BACKGROUND

The current fountain has been in place for over thirty years, has fallen into major disrepair
(Attachment C) and needs to be replaced.

3. SCOPE OF WORK

The PAPAC encourages artists to use sustainable materials and incorporate environmentally
friendly elements in their proposals. It is essential that the fountain make a splashing water
sound. The pump in the existing fountain has a 5HP Marathon motor, 208 volt Single Phase that
the City of Palo Alto Parks Department has scheduled for repair or replacement (see Attachment
D for pump information). Fountain design should reflect the site-specific spirit of California
Avenue. California Avenue in Palo Alto is known as the “Avenue of the Arts”. The design of the
fountain should fit within the existing fountain footprint which measures 16-feet in diameter.
Proposals may include benches or bollard elements in efforts to prevent vehicular traffic damage
to the fountain without obstructing traffic at this site. These elements must be carefully
considered so as not to restrict pedestrian, bicycle or vehicular traffic. Fountain design should
reflect a fountain that is easy to maintain and durable.
The artist budget is inclusive of the material costs, fabrication, delivery of fountain to site and
installation. The selected artist is also responsible for developing engineered drawings to scale of
fountain to be approved by the City’s Public Works Engineering Division. Artist will install
fountain and/or make arrangements for fountain to be installed onsite and supervise the
installation. The Artist may work in collaboration with a contractor who will remove existing
fountain, prepare site and install mechanicals, i.e. pump and electrical (separate and not included
in artist fee), and if required for fountain, construct pool.
