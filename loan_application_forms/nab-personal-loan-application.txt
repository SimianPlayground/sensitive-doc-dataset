Electronic Identity Verification
If you’re new to NAB, we will need to verify your identify. NAB is progressively rolling out enhanced system capability to manage it’s identity verification process.
We may be able to perform electronic verification in some circumstances, if you agree to it.
Electronic Identity Verification means that NAB may provide your name, address and date of birth to a Credit Reporting Body (CRB), such as Veda, and ask it to provide
an assessment of whether the information provided matches information already held by the CRB. The CRB will use the information provided by NAB in addition to its
own information to make its assessment. This is NOT a credit check.
In addition, where identification documents such as passport or driver’s license are used for identification purposes, NAB may contact the authority that issued the
documents to verify them by using the Government’s Document Verification Service. You do not have to be verified electronically, instead you may choose to provide
100 points of identification in person.
If available, do you consent to electronic identity verification for this application?
