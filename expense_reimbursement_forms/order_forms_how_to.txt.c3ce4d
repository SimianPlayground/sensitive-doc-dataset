                        documentation in the Orders slot of the wall file outside

                        mail the documents to the Department Purchasing

                  *P number is a 7 digit number assigned to the ProCard; it is NOT the 16
                  digit credit card number. If you do not know your cardâ€™s P number, see
                  an office staff member for assistance.
