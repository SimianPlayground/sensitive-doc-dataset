            general administration
2.1     Contact and general claim information
Patients may arrive at your office and present varying types of BCBSNC member
identification cards. This is because members can enroll in BCBSNC health care plans
and add dental coverage as an option. Members can also select a dental plan as a stand
alone coverage choice. Subsequently, a member may have an identification card for a
dental coverage only plan that displays the name and logo of the dental product
prominently in the upper right corner, on the front of the member’s identification card.
Or, if a member has health and dental coverage, the name and logo of the health care
coverage plan will be displayed in the upper right corner and the dental product’s name
and logo will typically be printed in the lower left corner.

     Provider Demographic Form
     It is a participating provider’s/group’s contractual obligation to notify Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina
     (BCBSNC) of any change in demographic information. This is critical to ensure BCBSNC and Blue Medicare
     HMO and Blue Medicare PPO members can access care through your practice by displaying the correct
     demographic information in the Provider Directory.

     Notice Contact – What is it?                For non-Medicare provider agreements, the Notice Contact is
     the name or title and address that you and BCBSNC are required to use to send certain notices regarding your

     agreement with us must contain a “Notice Contact” provision listing the name or title and address of the person
     to whom contractual notices and other communications regarding our agreement shall be sent.

     and the provider manual for more details. The “Notice Contact” may be different from your billing address and
     physical address. It is a participating provider’s/group’s contractual obligation to notify BCBSNC of any change
     to the Notice Contact.

             Pediatric Oral Health
BCBSNC medical plans offer limited dental benefits were applicable.
Effective January 1, 2014, Pediatric Oral Health benefits were added
to BCBSNC health plans as mandated under the Affordable Care Act
(ACA). The ACA mandate made Pediatric Oral Health (Pediatric Dental)
benefits available to children up to age nineteen (19). Pediatric
Dental benefit is an essential health benefit for all BCBSNC ACA
compliant plans for fully insured small groups and non-grandfathered
individual plans.

Pediatric Dental benefits offer a full range of dental services including
preventive, basic, major and medically necessary orthodontia services
covered under a small group or a non-grandfathered individual medical
policy with BCBSNC. Prior approval is required for medically necessary
orthodontia covered under Pediatric Oral Health.

Members covered under BCBSNC medical plan with Pediatric Dental
benefits may visit a dental network provider or an out-of-network provider
for dental services. If members choose to visit a network dentist they
may save on their out-of-pocket cost.

A participating dentist rendering dental care to a member with Pediatric
Dental benefits must submit claims using the 2012 ADA claim form to
BCBSNC medical plan first for reimbursement. The member’s medical
plan is considered primary. Once the claim is processed and payment
issued, the provider or member may submit a claim to the member’s
dental carrier for reimbursement. BCBSNC dental plan will always be
considered secondary to the member’s medical plan for Pediatric
Dental services.

4.7.1        Member eligibility, benefits and claim status
Dental providers should always verify a member’s actual eligibility
and benefits prior to providing dental care services. To verify eligibility,
benefits and claim status for pediatric dental services, contact medical
customer service at the phone number listed on the back of the
member’s ID card. Providers may also verify benefits by visiting the
Blue e website.

CHAPTER 6   GRID+
6.1       The National GRID+ Dental Network
The National GRID+ Dental Network, administered by the GRID Dental Corporation (GDC)*, is a national
dental network and includes many of the nation’s Blue plans. In addition, the GRID+ coordinates access to
networks wherever local Blue plans do not participate.



6.2       Participation in the GRID+ network
The following applies to dental providers participating with BCBSNC dental network.
+ Providers participating with the BCBSNC dental network are automatically included as a participating
  provider in the GRID+ network.
+ When members of other Blue plans are in North Carolina and searching for a participating dental provider,
  your practice will appear in the provider directory. This may assist you in growing your practice, should
  those members choose you as their dental provider.
+ In order to verify that a member of an out-of-state Blue plan qualifies as a “member” under your
  agreement, look for a “GRID+” indicator on the member’s Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield branded card or
  on the notification of payment. Claims processing, benefits, and customer service for these members will
  be handled by the out-of-state Blue plan that issued the card to the applicable member. Providers should
  reference the information on the back of the identification card.

CHAPTER 7
            billing and reimbursement
7.1     Administration of dental claims
With the implementation of the ACA mandated Pediatric Oral Health benefits, the processing of dental claims
have become more complex. The following is a general guideline for dental claims processing:

+ Dental benefits such as preventive, basic or major care are typically covered under a member’s dental benefit.
  BCBSNC utilizes the services of ACS Benefit Services, Inc. for the administration of claims for services covered
  under a member’s supplemental dental policy.
+ Services such as Pediatric Oral Health benefits, medically necessary orthodontia or medically necessary dental
  reconstructive services are typically covered under the member’s BCBSNC medical benefit. BCBSNC administers
  benefits for dental services covered under a member’s medical plan.
+ Dental services covered under the Federal Employee Benefit Health Plan are handled through BCBSNC.

Note: Claims administration for the Federal Employee Program is handled through BCBSNC for both dental
and medical services.


7.1.1   ACS Benefit Services, Inc. (ACS) – dental claims for services
        covered under a supplemental dental policy
BCBSNC utilizes the services of our wholly owned subsidiary ACS Benefit Services, Inc. (ACS), for the
administration of customer service and claims processing for BCBSNC dental products. ACS is a third party
administrator of self-funded medical and dental benefit plans. ACS has developed an advanced claims system for
servicing the BCBSNC dental products, which allows ACS to process claims with extreme accuracy because
benefits processing can be tailored for each employer group. ACS as our administrator for BCBSNC dental
products maintains procedures, policies and guidelines for dental providers transacting dental business. This
e-manual acts as a supplement to those procedures, policies and guidelines as determined by BCBSNC. In the
event there is a discrepancy, BCBSNC rules and guidelines administered by ACS will supersede this e-manual.


7.1.2   Dental claims for services covered under a medical benefit/Pediatric
        Oral Health benefit
Effective January 1, 2014, dental provider contracts apply to medical services. BCBSNC under our health benefit
plans provide benefits for services provided by a duly licensed doctor, doctor of dental surgery or doctor of dental
medicine for diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedures, including oral surgery involving bones or joints of the
jaw, when the procedure or dental treatment is related to one of the following conditions:

+ Accidental injury of the sound teeth, jaw, cheeks, lips, tongue, roof and floor of the mouth
+ Congenital deformity, including cleft lip and cleft palate
+ Removal of tumors, cysts which are not related to teeth or associate dental procedures
+ Tumors cysts exostoses for reasons other than for preparation for dentures

In addition, ACA mandated “Pediatric Oral Health Benefits” such as diagnostic and preventive, basic, major and
medically necessary orthodontia are covered under the medical plan for certain members. If the patient does not
have a BCBSNC medical benefit plan, submit Pediatric Oral Health electronic claims to Emdeon payer #61472.

BCBSNC administers these benefits through our advanced claims payment system. BCBSNC rules and
guidelines will supersede this e-manual. Providers are encouraged to access the BCBSNC website bcbsnc.com
to obtain copies of the procedures, policies and guidelines.



                                                                                                                       7-1

 relating to dental benefits.         relating to medical benefits.


Important note: Providers should always verify a member’s individual benefits and coverage prior to
rendering any dental service. The presentation of BCBSNC identification cards should not serve as a method
for verifying a member’s status or eligibility to receive dental benefits. In addition, all payments are subject to the
terms of the contract under which the individual is eligible to receive benefits.


7.2     BCBSNC dental claims submission
BCBSNC accepts dental claims in the following formats: EDI (electronic data interchange) submissions via the
Emdeon clearinghouse and paper claims.

Emdeon is the preferred and most efficient method.

An interactive paper claim form is available online. Using the bcbsnc-dental.com site, register and log in as a
provider. (Refer to Chapter 2 for instructions on registration.) You will then have access to the appropriate dental
claim form for each of the dental products which include the correct mailing address.


7.3     National Provider Identifiers
BCBSNC requires that all electronically transmitted claims include billing and rendering NPI (national provider
identifier) numbers. Providers with a Group NPI should list the Group NPI in box 49 of the claim form and the
Individual NPI in box 54 (rendering provider). The Individual NPI will apply to box 49 and 54 for solo providers.


7.4     Emdeon clearinghouse
Dental providers are encouraged to submit their claims via Emdeon. Claims are received by BCBSNC through
separate Emdeon payer numbers that identify product lines. Submitting claims using an incorrect payer ID
number will delay processing. Always refer to the member’s BCBSNC ID card to properly identify the correct plan
and the correct Emdeon payer ID number:

+ 61472 – Federal employees/Pediatric Oral Health/medical-dental claims
+ 61473 – BCBSNC Dental Blue for Group/Individual/Senior plans and Dental Blue for Federal employees
+ 61474 – BCBSNC Dental Blue Select (group enrollment only)



                                                                                                                          7-2
7.5     NEA FastAttach and Fast Look TM




Dental providers can send electronic attachments using FastAttach,
made available from National Electronic Attachment Inc. (NEA).
FastAttach enables dental providers to transmit electronic attachments
in support of electronic claims via the internet. Attachments can also be
stored for providers requesting the service. Attachments include: X-rays,
lab reports, EOBs, narratives, OP reports, dental notes, perio-charts
and most other documents required to process a claim.

Dental providers can receive additional information about FastAttach
services and/or sign up for FastAttach, by calling 1-800-782-5150,
option 2 or by visiting NEA on the Web at www.nea-fast.com. If
signing up for FastAttach use, enter the promotional code of
BCBSNCZ1M to receive special promotional information. Please note
this is a promotional rate and subject to expiration.

Additionally, NEA offers the FastLook system, which gives providers
one central site to view the attachment requirements for multiple
payers (BCBSNC), as well as, other dental care payers. Using
FastLook dental care providers can search by payer name and
procedure code to determine what, or if any, attachments need to
be sent to a member’s payer plan. For more information about the
FastLook system, please visit FastLook on the Web at
www.welcometonea.com or call 1-800-782-5150, ext #2.

Please note that costs and/or fees can be associated with the use
of FastAttach and/or the FastLook systems. Dental providers enrolling
for use of the NEA offered applications assume all associated
expenses. See Chapter 11 for specific details.


7.6     Paper claims
Claims for dental services must be submitted on the 2012 version of
the American Dental Association (ADA) claim form. 2012 ADA claim
forms may be purchased from a vendor or directly from the ADA by
calling 1-800-947-4746 or visiting ADA on the Web at www.ada.org.

7.7     Claim form completion
Dental claim forms must be submitted with all required fields complete, using acceptable data and
coding sets needed to complete processing of a claim (please note that additional information may be
requested). Claim submissions should report all rendered services and include procedure codes from
the most current ADA Current Dental Terminology (CDT) user’s manual.

All participating dental providers must submit claims within one hundred and eighty (180) days from
the date of completion of the dental treatment. Below is a summary (not all-inclusive) of what’s
needed to comply with claims submission requirements:

+ Use of the 2012 version of the American Dental Association (ADA) claim form is required.
  Complete by following the 2012 ADA claim form instructions.
+ Essential data elements must be completed (essential data elements include, but are not limited to,
  place of service codes and procedure codes).
+ Claims must be completed using the ADA standard code set. Claims missing an essential data
  element or listing inappropriate code sets, or are otherwise illegible, will be returned.
+ Include necessary supporting documentation (i.e., X-rays and dental provider notes).
+ Claim forms must include the member’s name and ID number (including alpha prefix and suffix)
  and patient’s date of birth.
+ The dental provider’s identifying information and the location where service was provided must be
  clearly identified on the claim form.
+ A date of service must be provided on the claim form for each service line submitted.
+ Each separate (individual calendar date) of service must be submitted as a single claim. Individual
  claims may not span dates of service with the exception of certain orthodontia services.
+ List all quadrants, tooth numbers and surfaces for dental codes that necessitate identification
  (extractions, root canals, amalgams and resin fillings). Failure to provide tooth and surface
  identification codes can result in the delay or denial of claims payment.

NOTE: The NPI is an identifier assigned by the Federal government to all providers considered to be HIPAA
covered entities. Dentists who are not covered entities may elect to obtain an NPI at their discretion, or
may be enumerated if required by a participating provider agreement with a third-party payer, or applicable
state law/regulation.


  An NPI is unique to an individual dentist or dental entity, and has no intrinsic meaning. There are 2
  types of NPI available to dentists and dental practices:
  + Type 1 Individual Provider - All individual dentists are eligible to apply for Type 1 NPIs, regardless
    of whether they are covered by HIPAA.
  + Type 2 Organization Provider - A health care provider that is an organization, such as a group
    practice or corporation. Individual dentists who are incorporated may enumerate as Type 2
    providers, in addition to being enumerated as a Type 1. All incorporated dental practices and group
    practices are eligible for enumeration as Type 2 providers.

7.10      Required identifying information
+ Member’s name, BCBSNC identification number (including alpha prefix and suffix) and date of birth
  must be listed on all claims submitted. If the member’s identification number is missing or miscoded on
  the claim form, the patient cannot be identified. This could result in the claim being returned to the
  submitting provider’s office, causing a delay in payment. The member’s ID is located on the member’s
  BCBSNC identification card. (Do not use “nick names” when submitting claims.)
+ The rendering and billing office must be clearly identified on the claim. Please include a typed
  dentist (practice) name, NPI and tax identification number for both the rendering provider and the billing
  entity. The provider name, tax ID and billing address must match the provider’s contract with BCBSNC.
  Note: Providers with a Group NPI number should list the Group NPI number in field forty-nine (49)
  and the individual NPI number in box fifty-four (54) (rendering provider). The individual NPI will apply to
  box forty-nine (49) and fifty-four (54) for solo providers.
+ The date of service must be provided on the claim form for each service line submitted.
+ Use approved ADA dental codes as published in the current CDT book.
+ Claims must be submitted within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the date of service.
+ List all quadrants, tooth numbers and surfaces for dental codes that necessitate identification
  (extractions, root canals, amalgams and resin fillings). Failure to provide tooth and surface identification
  codes can result in the delay or denial of claim payment.

Note: The Blue Book      SM
                             Dental e-Manual, available at bcbsnc.com/content/providers/blue-book.htm,
offers additional information about medical/dental and pediatric billing.


7.11      Documentation, treatment plans, charting and X-rays
Please send only copies of X-rays or readable images. X-rays will not be returned.

Dental providers can send electronic attachments using FastAttach available on the Web at
nea-fast.com/.

For a listing of CDT specific codes and corresponding documentation that can be accepted by NEA for
transmission per BCBSNC coverage plan type, please see Chapter 11 of this e-manual.


7.12      Postage
Affix the proper postage when mailing bulk documentation to BCBSNC. BCBSNC does not accept postage
due mail. This mail will be returned to the sender and will result in delay of processing and payment.


7.13      Timely filing of claims
To be eligible for payment, claims must be received no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days
of the date of service. Participating dental providers may not collect, or attempt to collect payment from
BCBSNC members for any claim that was not submitted within the one hundred and eighty (180) day
time period.

7.14      Dental coding terminology, dental
          procedures and nomenclature
Dental providers should report services using codes found in the most
current edition of the Current Dental Terminology (CDT) manual. The CDT
manual is published by the American Dental Association (ADA) for reporting
services for treatment. The existence of a procedure code does not guarantee
coverage; the benefit is determined based on the member’s contract. The
CDT manual can be purchased directly from the ADA by calling 1-800-947-4746
or by accessing their website at www.ada.org.


7.14.1     Deletion and addition of ADA codes
Once the ADA deletes codes, we will no longer accept the codes as of the
effective date of the deletion. Submitted claims will be rejected or returned to
the provider’s office. All new ADA codes added will be considered at 80% of
charge until adequate data is obtained for fair pricing.



7.15      Dental claims processing
In an effort to process claims accurately and consistently, ACS as our
claims processing administrator has developed processing standards that
represent current community standards of dental care and are derived
through consultation with dental practices, academic communities and
current scientific literature. These standards are supported by system edits
designed to adjudicate claims efficiently and accurately based on the
member’s contract. These edits use the most cost-effective, clinically
appropriate claim reimbursement, based on clinical standards and
contractual limitations.




                                                                                   7 - 14
7.16      Mutually exclusive edits
Mutually exclusive edits are designed to identify the billing for two (2) or more procedures that by dental care
standards would not usually be billed for the same patient, on the same date of service.

7.23      General criteria
Procedures should be performed based on dental necessity and as

P&R Dental Strategies, Inc. is an industry leader in dental utilization
management services that offers a comprehensive set of solutions to
support the business needs of dental benefit payers. BCBSNC has
entered into an agreement with P&R Dental Strategies, Inc. to facilitate

Although P&R Dental Strategies, Inc. is based in New York, dentists who
are reviewing the claims are licensed in North Carolina. If you receive a
letter requiring additional information, please send the information
directly to P&R Dental Strategies, Inc. at the address on the letter.
Sending it to the normal claims address will delay the review.

7.25      Dental (CDT) accidental
          procedure codes
Claims coded with (CDT) accidental procedure codes are processed
under the member’s medical coverage instead of their dental coverage.
Oral surgical services and services rendered as a result of an accidental
injury must be reported on the most current version of the American
Dental Association (ADA) claim form. Services not covered under the
dental plan should be submitted to the member’s medical plan using a
CMS-1500 claim form.




                                                                            7 - 26
7.26        Dental-medical claims CPT/HCPC
Claims for “dental-medical” (dental related services that fall under a patient’s medical benefit), such as accidental
injury and/or TMJ services, should be filed to BCBSNC (or the patient’s medical benefit carrier) using the most
current version of the CMS-1500 claim form. Essential data elements must be completed.

Essential data elements include, but are not limited to, place of service codes and procedure codes (including
modifiers if applicable). Claims must be completed using CPT and/or HCPC standard code sets. Claims missing
an essential data element or that use an inappropriate code or are otherwise illegible will be returned.

BCBSNC accepts medical service claims when filed using the CMS-1500 paper claim form and when filed
electronically. If sending a paper claim form to BCBSNC, please submit to the medical claims address listed on
the member’s BCBSNC identification card. Providers electing to transmit claims electronically for medical services
can obtain resources and required forms on the BCBSNC electronic solutions website located at bcbsnc.com/
content/providers/edi/bluee/signingup.htm.

BCBSNC can accept claims for Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield member’s having medical benefits coverage from
a Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plan other than BCBSNC, when services are provided for accidental injuries or
other services that qualify under the out-of-state member’s medical benefit plan.

+ Send claims for “dental-medical” services provided to out-of-state Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan members to:
  Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina
  PO Box 35
  Durham, NC 27702
  Questions about claims filed for out-of-state members should be placed by calling 1-800-487-5522. Dental
  providers can also verify an out-of-state Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plan member’s medical eligibility or
  benefits by calling 1-800-676-BLUE (2583).
+ The Pediatric Oral Health process dictates that claims are processed by the specific plan and does not flow
  through the current IPP process.


7.28        Payment guidelines
Providers are notified of payment determination via messages contained on the notification of benefit (NOB).
For example, a message will appear when services that are considered incidental to the primary service are not
eligible for separate reimbursement.




                                                                                                                        7 - 27
7.29      Payment for covered
          services only
Participating dental providers are eligible for payment, only when,
the services provided are clinically necessary and covered as
part of the member’s benefit plan. The issuance of the member’s
benefit payment amount is considered payment in full, with the
exception of any applicable deductible, coinsurance, and/or
copayment amounts.



7.30      Appeals and review of
          benefit determinations
Please contact BCBSNC Dental Blue® customer service for
assistance with making a request for appeal or benefit
determination review. Please use the call center appropriate
for the member’s benefit coverage type as outlined in Chapter 2
of this e-manual.



7.31      Billing BCBSNC members
Participating providers agree not to bill members for services
until after receipt of the BCBSNC issued notification of benefits,
except for member’s copayments. Member’s copayment amounts,
when applicable, are listed on the member’s BCBSNC identification
card. However, dental providers may bill BCBSNC members
prior to the receipt of the Notification of Benefits (NOB) for
services verified in advance as non-covered. Any amounts
that both you and the member agree were collected erroneously
for any reason must be refunded to the member within forty-five
(45) days of the receipt of the NOB or your discovery of the error.




                                                                  7 - 28
7.32      Payment options
BCBSNC offers two (2) available payment options to participating providers. Please see the table below for details

Important note: Members receive payments directly when services are rendered by a
non-participating provider.




                                                                                                                     7 - 29
7.33      Amounts billable to members
Providers may collect any applicable copayments at the time service is rendered. Any applicable coinsurance
and/or deductible amounts may be collected from BCBSNC members only after receipt of the notification of
benefits. Amounts for non-covered services may only be collected if they meet the criteria outlined in the
instructions for the hold harmless provision as contained in Section 7.37 of this e-manual. Any amounts
collected erroneously by a dental care provider, from a member, for any reason, shall be refunded to the member
within forty-five (45) days of the error being identified.



7.34      Amounts not billable to members
Participating providers may not collect any payments from members for covered services, except for any applicable
copayment, coinsurance and deductible amounts. Participating providers may not balance bill BCBSNC members
for the difference between billed charges and the amount allowed on the notification of benefits for a processed
claim. Any differences between a dental provider’s charges and the allowed amount are considered contractual
adjustments and are not billable to members. Participating providers may not seek payment from either members
or BCBSNC if a proper claim has not been submitted to BCBSNC within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the
date a service is rendered. Participating providers charging fees for administrative services, such as paper work
completion or furnishing clinical records may not bill BCBSNC members for these fees.



7.35      Billing members for non-covered services
Sometimes a dental provider may be asked by a member to provide services that are not covered by the
member’s benefit plan. Only under the following conditions may the provider bill the member for such
services:

+ The provider informs the member in advance of providing the service, in a written notification, that the specific
  service might not be covered.
+ The member signs a written acknowledgment that he/she received such notification prior to receiving the
  specific service at issue. That notification must inform the member that the particular service at issue may not
  be covered.
+ The member also acknowledges in advance and in writing that he/she has chosen to have the service at issue
  and if it is indeed not covered, the member is responsible for the expense and will pay the dental provider directly.
+ The written notice regarding a particular service must be specific, defining the exact treatment of care being
  provided to the member. It is not acceptable to use a generic release form with a general statement regarding
  member’s obligations to pay for non-covered services.




                                                                                                                          7 - 30
7.36      Coordination of benefits
When a member is covered by more than one (1) coverage plan, one plan must be designated as primary and
the other as secondary. Coordination of benefits (COB) logic is used to determine which plan pays first on the claim.

If BCBSNC is primary and another insurance plan is secondary, use the following guidelines:
+ Any prior approval and/or certification requirements must be followed according to the member’s BCBSNC plan.
+ File a claim first with BCBSNC. The secondary plan may be billed any copayment, coinsurance and/or deductible
  amounts and for services not covered under the BCBSNC member’s benefit plan.

If BCBSNC is secondary, use the following guidelines:
+ Any prior approval and/or certification requirements must be followed according to the member’s BCBSNC plan.
+ File a claim with the primary plan first, after the primary plan pays its benefits, then file the secondary claim
  along with the primary payment information to BCBSNC.

BCBSNC and our member’s combined liability are limited to the BCBSNC contractual allowed amount. The
contract between the provider and BCBSNC allows that benefits will be coordinated up to the contractual
allowance. Disallowed amounts and/or services cannot be billed to the member.

Pediatric Oral Health benefits covered under the health plan will always be considered primary. Stand-alone
dental will be considered secondary. Coordination of benefits rules will apply.


7.37      Hold harmless provision
Providers agree not to bill or otherwise hold members, BCBSNC or any third party responsible for payment for
services and/or supplies provided to members, which are determined not to be clinically necessary and/or not
eligible under the member’s benefit plan, except when the following conditions shall have been met:
+ The dental provider obtained prior authorization or certification in advance of providing the specific services
  and/or supplies to the member – and/or – the dental provider gave specific written notification to the member in
  advance of providing the non-medically necessary services or other non-covered services, explaining that such
  service might not be covered under the member’s benefit plan; and the member signed a written authorization
  stating that:
  - The member received from the provider notification that the specific services and/or supplies may not be
    covered by his or her benefit plan.
  - The member received the notification prior to receiving the specific services and/or supplies.
  - The notification informed the member that the particular services and/or supplies, if not covered by member’s
    benefit plan, are provided at the member’s own expense, if the member elects to receive the specific services
    and/or supplies.
  - The provider obtained the member’s written authorization prior to rendering the specific services and/or supplies.
  - The member’s authorization includes that such services and/or supplies may not be covered by his or her
    benefit plan and the member agrees to pay for such services and/or supplies apart from his or her benefit plan.
  - The member’s authorization specifies that the member elects to receive such services and/or supplies at the
    member’s own expense and the provider has obtained the member’s written authorization.
  - The notification by the provider and the authorization by the member, as set forth in the agreement, shall be given
    regarding a particular service at issue in the specific treatment of a member and not as a matter of general or
    standard procedure in all cases.

Dental providers agree to provide BCBSNC and/or ACS with a copy of any and all such written authorizations upon
request. Please refer to your dental care practice’s contractual agreement with BCBSNC to review the hold
harmless provision and how the provision applies. If you have questions regarding the hold harmless provision,
please contact your regional BCBSNC Network Management representative at 1-800-777-1643.

                                                                                                                          7 - 31
            Pre-treatment estimates
CHAPTER 8
            and prior approval
8.1     Pre-treatment estimate of benefits
A pre-estimate of benefits is a request made prior to a procedure being performed, to verify benefits and clinical
appropriateness of a procedure. This allows both the dental care provider and the patient to make an informed
decision of potential coverage for a given procedure in advance.

When the charges from a dentist for a proposed course of treatment are expected to be over $250, a pre-treatment
estimate of benefits is strongly recommended before any services are performed. The member or the dentist
can make a request for a pre-treatment estimate of benefits (however, certain procedural and dental necessity
information will most often be needed from the dental provider rendering care). Once received, the information will
be reviewed and a pre-treatment estimate of benefits will be provided.

When requesting a pre-estimate of benefits, please send a written request along with any supporting documentation
to the claims mailing address that’s listed on the member’s identification card, or use the claims mailing information
located in Chapter 2 of this e-manual.

Pre-treatment requests for a specific diagnosis or procedure must be submitted in writing. This chart provides
information regarding required documentation needed before a pre-treatment estimate of benefits can be determined:

8.2     Prior plan approval
Prior approval (also referred to as prior review and prior
authorization) is the process by which BCBSNC reviews the
provision of certain “dental-medical” services (dental services
paid under a member’s medical benefit, such as, TMJ, accidental
injury or medically necessary orthodontia covered under Pediatric
Oral Health) against health care management guidelines prior to
the services being provided.

Reviews are done to confirm the following:
+ Member eligibility
+ Benefit coverage
+ Compliance with BCBSNC corporate medical policy regarding
  medical necessity
+ Appropriateness of setting
+ Requirements for utilization of in-network and out-of-network
  facilities and/or providers

It’s important for in-network providers to remember that hold
harmless is a contractual agreement between BCBSNC and
participating providers. The agreement states that the provider
may not balance bill a member for services or supplies that were
not prior authorized or certified in advance by BCBSNC and/or
deemed not medically necessary by BCBSNC. Members are not
to be held responsible for any failure to obtain PPA.

If a request for PPA is submitted and not approved for medical
necessity, and the member elects to continue with the service,
then you would need to have the member sign a waiver that they
are aware of the denial of services and responsible for the cost.

When a BCBSNC member seeks care from a dental provider
that is nonparticipating with BCBSNC, the care will be reimbursed
at the lower benefit level, with the member having liability for a
higher out-of-pocket expense. The member is responsible for
making sure that the PPA is obtained.




                                                                     8-2
8.2.1     Submitting a request
Requests for prior plan approval can be submitted to BCBSNC’s Care Management and Operations department in
one (1) of the following ways:
+ Call 1-800-672-7897 Monday- Friday, 8:00 am – 5:00 pm
+ Fax clinical information to: 1-800-571-7942
+ Mail clinical information to:
  Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina
  Attention: Care Management and Operations
  PO Box 2291
  Durham, NC 27702-2291

Include the following information when submitting a request:
+ Practice name and BCBSNC provider number
+ Contact name, phone number, and fax number
+ Patient’s name, BCBSNC member ID number, and date of birth
+ Attending physician’s name, BCBSNC provider number, and phone number
+ Treatment setting – i.e., physician’s/provider’s office
+ Expected dates of service
+ Description of diagnosis and diagnosis codes
+ Description of procedure and applicable codes
+ Clinical information, including history and physical, treatment plan, and orthodontic contract

If all clinical information is submitted with the request, then BCBSNC has three (3) business days to return a
decision. If the nurses or medical directors need additional information, then the process can take up to fifteen
(15) calendar days. A letter will be faxed to you with the determination.

The BCBSNC corporate medical policy for Pediatric Orthodontics includes documentation requirements,
along with guidelines for coverage. Dental providers can access the policy at bcbsnc.com/content/services/
medical-policy/index.htm.


8.2.2     Peer to peer review
BCBSNC medical directors are available to discuss clinical problems and benefit issues with network providers,
particularly where there are issues that complicate the management of the patient’s condition. If you have
questions about a certification request, you may request to speak directly to a medical director by calling
1-800-672-7897, extension 51019. The purpose of the peer to peer discussion is to give the requesting physicians
an opportunity to discuss the clinical details of a requested service. A peer to peer review may also be requested
by a BCBSNC medical director in order to obtain more clinical information from an attending physician before
making a final determination.




                                                                                                                     8-3
8.2.3     Reconsideration review
BCBSNC offers a provider courtesy review for denied services.
This is separate from the appeals process and is done if there
is relevant information that was not previously submitted. This
must be requested within one hundred and eighty (180) days
from the date of the adverse benefit determination letter. Dental
providers can submit this information by calling or faxing to
the same numbers for Care Management and Operations (see
Section 8.2.1, Submitting a request).


8.2.4     Appeals for medical
          necessity denials
Appeals for cases that are deemed not medically necessary by
BCBSNC, and are pre-service, are member appeals. Member
appeals must be initiated by the member. Providers can initiate
an appeal on the member’s behalf only with a signed member
consent form. Member benefit notification letters will include
instructions for members on how to file an appeal for medical
necessity denials. Post-service appeals are provider appeals,
and can continue to be submitted by providers. To find out more
about BCBSNC appeals and grievance procedures, please refer
to Chapter 12 of this e-manual.

9.2     Medically necessary orthodontia
The ACA requires that ten (10) essential health benefits are included on every qualified health plan. One (1) of
those essential benefits is pediatric dental coverage. Included in the pediatric dental essential health benefit is the
coverage of orthodontia when it is medically necessary. BCBSNC will administer this benefit as follows:
+ Covered members under the age of nineteen (19) – the benefit ends on the member’s nineteenth (19th) birthday.
+ Twelve (12) month waiting period for the member to be eligible for this coverage, beginning on the member’s
  plan effective date. For example, if a member’s plan began on 1/1/2014, then that member would be eligible for
  their orthodontia coverage on 1/1/2015.
+ Codes (D8010, D8020, D8030, D8040, D8050, D8060, D8070, D8080, D8090, D8210, D8220, D8660, D8670,
  D8680, D8690, and D8999) will be added to BCBSNC’s prior plan approval list, which can be found at
  bcbsnc.com/content/providers/ppa/services.htm. This list is updated quarterly. Please reference Chapter 8
  for additional information related to prior plan approval.

9.2.1   Claims
Since medical necessary orthodontia is a medical benefit, there are a few changes to how claims are filed:
+ Please be sure to use the 2012 ADA claims form with the appropriate CDT codes.

9.3     Notes on orthodontic claims
+ The dental provider must submit a complete treatment plan.
+ Initial fee/down payment (date braces are placed)
+ Number of treatment months
+ Monthly fee
+ File orthodontic claims on a monthly basis
+ Phase I treatment is minor orthodontic treatment and can be paid in
  one total fee when treatment begins. Phase II treatment is comprehensive
  orthodontics and is divided into multiple payments. The first benefit
  payment is 50% of your initial payment, but no more than half of the
  lifetime maximum for orthodontics. This is followed by monthly
  coinsurance payments based on the existing treatment plan, up to
  the lifetime maximum for orthodontics. In order for benefits to
  continue throughout the treatment plan, this dental benefit plan must
  remain in effect, the member must remain enrolled in the plan, and
  the member’s orthodontic lifetime maximum must not be met.
+ Liability for orthodontic treatments should be assumed with the
  effective date of coverage, even if the braces were in place prior to
  coverage. Coverage is available from the effective date forward but
  only for the remaining time and fees (even if only a part of a
  member’s lifetime orthodontic benefits are used).




                                                                             9-2
CHAPTER 10   Provider certification
10.1      Provider certification
BCBSNC electronically submits annual payment information to the IRS. An IRS form W-9 is required to be
submitted as requested for the registration process, or when you file your first claim with BCBSNC, or as the
result of an IRS action due to a CP2100 report. Failure to provide a W-9 or certified W-9 when requested, may
result in an IRS required withhold of payment. Dental providers may also find it necessary to re-file an IRS form
W-9 to reflect changes in a practice as recommended by a tax accountant.

BCBSNC participates in the IRS tax identification number (TIN) matching service to verify provider certification.
A description of the matching services is available on the Web at www.irs.gov. BCBSNC utilizes the matching
service to validate IRS forms W-9 submitted by dental providers. The tax name and TIN, either an employer
identification number (EIN) or social security number (SSN), submitted on the IRS form W-9 must match the
IRS records.


10.2      Credentialing and re-credentialing
BCBSNC credentials all practitioners of care applying for membership in the network(s) and re-credentials any
applicable contracted practitioner every three (3) years. Practitioners of care that are required to be credentialed
and re-credentialed include both doctors of dental surgery (DDS) and doctors of dental medicine (DMD).
Guidelines are followed for all providers applying for participation in the BCBSNC networks. These guidelines
have been adopted by BCBSNC and adhere to the guidelines established by the National Committee for Quality
Assurance (NCQA) and the North Carolina Department of Insurance (NCDOI). NCQA is responsible for
accrediting managed care organizations (MCO’s) using specific standards for credentialing, quality management,
utilization management, member rights and responsibilities, preventive care, and medical records. The NCDOI
is the regulatory body for the state of North Carolina for managed care organizations.

BCBSNC makes best efforts to process and complete all credentialing and re-credentialing applications within
sixty (60) days of receipt of a completed application. For further information about the credentialing and/or
re-credentialing process and to download forms and applications, please visit the “Providers Applying for
Credentialing” page located at bcbsnc.com/content/providers/dental-providers/join-network.htm.

Additional forms required by Network Management when enrolling in the BCBSNC network:
+ Individual provider number application and/or group provider number application
+ Substitute W-9 form*
*Available for download at bcbsnc.com/content/providers/dental-providers/join-network.htm.

11.1      NEA accepted codes for FastAttach                               TM




The following listing of CDT codes has been compiled for dental providers for use when sending electronic
attachments using FastAttach (when supplying the needed supporting documentation with electronic claims). This
chart has been designed to help dental providers distinguish the appropriate documentation accepted by NEA for
transmission, based on CDT code submission and BCBSNC coverage plan.

Please note that the below chart has been designed as a guide but is not intended to be all inclusive. The
absence of a code or attachment type does not preclude our requesting that other or additional information be
provided, if needed to properly administer a member’s dental benefits. Additionally, inclusion of a code does not
guarantee payment or a member’s eligibility for benefits. This listing is subject to change.
Dental care providers can view the attachment requirements for BCBSNC, as well as, other dental care payers
when using NEA FastLook.

             Appeal and grievance
CHAPTER 12
             procedures
12.1       Member appeal and
           grievance process
In accordance with state law and in response to heightened concerns
about member privacy and the confidentiality of medical information.
BCBSNC requires the member’s written authorization in order for
a third party, including the member’s provider, to pursue an appeal or
grievance on the member’s behalf. The appeal and grievance processes
are available to address member concerns about:
+ Adverse medical necessity decisions (non-certifications)
+ BCBSNC decisions related to the availability, delivery or quality of
  dental care
+ Claims payment, handling, or reimbursement
+ The relationship between BCBSNC and the member

Member appeals must be requested within one hundred and eighty (180)
days of the adverse benefit determination letter. Member appeals have
a thirty (30) day turnaround time once they are received by BCBSNC.
There are expedited processes if a situation is urgent. Benefit notification
letters will have instructions for how members can file an appeal. In order
for you, the provider, to represent the member in a level I member appeal,
a written authorization must be obtained from the member. The member
may obtain the member appeal representation authorization form by
calling the customer service phone number located on the back of their
ID card or the member can download a copy at bcbsnc.com. A copy of
the member representation authorization form is included in this section
of the Dental e-Manual. Requests for review should also include all
pertinent dental records information, not previously supplied to BCBSNC.
Member authorization must be received by BCBSNC for a specific issue.
A blanket authorization statement for appeal cannot be used. A signed
authorization will remain valid until the particular issue is resolved or until
authorization is rescinded by the member. Providers should submit
documents for a level I appeal along with the appeal representation form
to the following address:

12.2      Member grievance policy
Occasionally, BCBSNC receives complaints from members about a provider or their staff regarding quality of care
issues. In order to appropriately respond to our members, BCBSNC may ask you to review and provide a written
response to such cases. You are required to cooperate with BCBSNC member grievance policies and must respond
to BCBSNC direct inquiries within the timeframe specified in each request. This will ensure the best service to our
mutual customer, our member/your patient.


12.2.1      Level I provider appeals
Level I provider appeals consist of retrospective reviews and do not require a member signed authorization. A
post-service level I provider appeals of claims is performed based on your belief that a claim has been denied
or adjudicated incorrectly. The provider appeal process is separate from BCBSNC’s member rights and appeals
process. If at any time the member files an appeal during a provider appeal, the member’s appeal supersedes the
provider appeal. Providers may not appeal items related to member benefit or contractual issues. If you believe a
claim has been denied or adjudicated incorrectly, you may initiate a request for review by submitting a written
request for appeal. To request a claim review regarding a processed claim related to:
+ Coding, bundling, or fees
+ Medical necessity

Providers will have ninety (90) calendar days from the adjudication date to submit the level I billing/coding dispute.

organization. Dental providers may file a level II post-service provider appeal for clinical necessity or billing
disputes with MES Solutions, an independent review organization. There is a filing fee associated with all
requests for a level II post-service provider appeal.


12.2.3      Process for submitting a post-service level II provider appeal
The level II post-service provider appeal request should clearly identify the issue that is in dispute and rationale
for the appeal. Demographic information including subscriber name, patient name, patient BCBSNC ID number,
provider name, and provider ID number should also be included with any request for appeal. Level II post-service
provider appeals require a filing fee to be submitted before the review can begin. Providers may reduce
administrative cost associated with records submission by first verifying that the record document information is
consistent with BCBSNC dental policy, payment policy and clinical edit clarification guidelines.

post-service provider appeal billing dispute or clinical necessity denial, as described below:




                                                                                                                         12 - 2
12.2.4      Level II post-service provider
            appeal for billing disputes
The BCBSNC billing dispute resolution process is available to
resolve disputes over the application of coding and payment rules
and methodologies to specific patients. Dental providers must submit
a written request for level II post-service provider billing dispute
appeal within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of the level I
post-service provider appeal denial letter.

Dental providers must exhaust BCBSNC level I post-service provider
appeal process before submitting a level II post-service provider

additional similar submissions will be sent. If the one (1) year lapses

aggregate, the original dispute will be dismissed. The filing fee will be
refunded in the event that the dental provider prevails in the level II
post-service appeal process.

  devices that do not have unrestricted market approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
  final approval from any other governmental regulatory body for use in treatment of a specified
  condition. Any approval that is granted as an interim step in the regulatory process is not a substitute
  for final or unrestricted market approval.
+ There is insufficient or inconclusive scientific evidence in peer-reviewed medical or dental literature to
  permit BCBSNC’s evaluation of the therapeutic value of the service or supply.
+ There is inconclusive evidence that the service or supply has a beneficial effect on dental health
  outcomes.
+ The service or supply under consideration is not as beneficial as other established alternatives.
+ There is insufficient information or inconclusive scientific evidence that, when utilized in a non-
  investigational setting, the service or supply has a beneficial effect on dental health outcomes and is as
  beneficial as any established alternatives.
