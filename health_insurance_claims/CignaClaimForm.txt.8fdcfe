Comprehensive completion instructions for the ADA Dental Claim Form are found in Section 6 of the ADA Publication titled CDT-2005.
Key extracts from that section of CDT-2005 follow:
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
   A. The form is designed so that the Primary Payer’s (primary insurance company) name and address (Item 3) are visible in a standard
      #10 window envelope. Please fold the form using the ‘tick-marks’ printed in the margin.
   B. In the upper-right of the form, a blank space is provided for the convenience of the payer or insurance company, to allow the
      assignment of a claim or control number.
   C. All Items in the form must be completed unless it is noted on the form or in the comprehensive instructions that completion is not required.
   D. When a name and address field is required the full name of an individual or a business, address and zip code must be entered.
   E. All dates must include the four-digit year.
   F. If the number of procedures reported exceeds the number of lines available on one claim form, the remaining procedures must be
      listed on a separate, fully completed claim form.
COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB)
   When a claim is being submitted to a secondary payer, complete the form in its entirety and attach the primary payers Explanation of
   Benefits (EOB) showing the amount paid by the primary payer. You may indicate the amount the primary carrier paid in the “Remarks”
   field (Item # 35).
ITEMS OF NOTE
    39. Number of Enclosures (00 to 99): This item is completed whether or not radiographs, oral images, or study models are submitted
        with the claim. If no enclosures are submitted, enter 00 in each of the boxes to verify that nothing has been sent and therefore no
        possible attachments are missing.
         When supplementary material is sent with the claim, the number of each type is entered in the appropriate box, using two digits.
         If less than 10, use 0 in the first position. ‘Oral Images’ include digital radiographic images and photographs and are reported by the
         number of images.
     43. Replacement of Prosthesis?: This Item applies to Crowns and all Fixed or Removable Prostheses (e.g. bridges and dentures).
         Please review the following three situations in order to determine how to complete this Item.
               a) If the claim does not involve a prosthetic restoration check “NO” and proceed to Item 45.
               b) If the claim is for the initial placement of a crown, or a fixed or removable prosthesis, check “NO” and proceed to Item 45.
               c) If the patient has previously had these teeth replaced by a crown, or a fixed or removable prosthesis, or the claim is to replace
                  an existing crown, check the “YES” field and complete section 44.
     53. Certification: Signature of the treating or rendering dentist and the date the form is signed. This is the dentist who performed, or is in
         the process of performing, procedures indicated by date for the patient. If the claim form is being used to obtain a pre-estimate or
         pre-authorization, it is not necessary for the dentist to sign the form. Dentists should be aware that they have an ethical and legal
         obligation to refund fees for services that are paid in advance but are not completed.
