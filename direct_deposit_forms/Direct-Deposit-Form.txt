    To enroll in Full Service Direct Deposit, simply fill out this form and give it to your payroll manager. Attach a voided check for each checking
    account - not a deposit slip. If depositing into a savings account, ask your bank to give you the Routing/Transit Number for your account. It isn’t
    always the same as the number on a savings deposit slip. This will help ensure that you are paid correctly.

    Important! Please read and sign before completing and submitting.
    I hereby authorize CompuPay to deposit any amounts owed me as instructed by my employer by initiating credit entries to my accounts at the financial institutions
    (hereinafter “Bank”) indicated on this form. Further, I authorize Bank to accept and to credit any credit entries indicated by CompuPay to my accounts. In the
    event that CompuPay deposits funds erroneously into my account, I authorize CompuPay to debit my account for an amount not to exceed the original amount of
    the erroneous credit account. I further authorize CompuPay to debit my account in the event my employer does not provide funds to cover credits initiated by
    CompuPay.
        This authorization is to remain in full force and effect until CompuPay and Bank have received written notice from me of its termination in such time and in
    such manner as to afford CompuPay and Bank reasonable opportunity to act on it.
