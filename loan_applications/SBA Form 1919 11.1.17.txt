                                                Statements Required by Law and Executive Order                                         Expiration Date: 07/31/2020


              Please read the following notices regarding use of federal financial assistance programs and then sign and date the certification.

 SBA is required to withhold or limit financial assistance, to impose special conditions on approved loans, to provide special notices to applicants or
 borrowers and to require special reports and data from borrowers in order to comply with legislation passed by the Congress and Executive Orders
 issued by the President and by the provisions of various inter-agency agreements. SBA has issued regulations and procedures that implement these
 laws and executive orders. These are contained in Parts 112, 113, and 117 of Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations and in Standard Operating
 Procedures.
 Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) -- Under the provisions of the Privacy Act, you are not required to provide your social security number. Failure to
 provide your social security number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to which you are entitled. Disclosures of name and other personal
 identifiers are, however, required for a benefit, as SBA requires an individual seeking assistance from SBA to provide it with sufficient information
 for it to make a character determination. In determining whether an individual is of good character, SBA considers the person’s integrity, candor,
 and disposition toward criminal actions. Additionally, SBA is specifically authorized to verify your criminal history, or lack thereof, pursuant to
 section 7(a)(1)(B), 15 USC Section 636(a)(1)(B) of the Small Business Act ( the Act). Further, for all forms of assistance, SBA is authorized to
 make all investigations necessary to ensure that a person has not engaged in acts that violate or will violate the Act or the Small Business
 Investment Act, 15 USC Sections 634(b)(11) and 687(b)(a), respectively. For these purposes, you are asked to voluntarily provide your social
 security number to assist SBA in making a character determination and to distinguish you from other individuals with the same or similar name or
 other personal identifier.
 Any person can request to see or get copies of any personal information that SBA has in his or her file when that file is retrieved by individual
 identifiers such as name or social security numbers. Requests for information about another party may be denied unless SBA has the written
 permission of the individual to release the information to the requestor or unless the information is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of
 Information Act.

 The Privacy Act authorizes SBA to make certain “routine uses” of information protected by that Act. One such routine use is the disclosure of
 information maintained in SBA’s system of records when this information indicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil, criminal,
 or administrative in nature. Specifically, SBA may refer the information to the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local or foreign, charged
 with responsibility for, or otherwise involved in investigation, prosecution, enforcement or prevention of such violations. Another routine use is
 disclosure to other Federal agencies conducting background checks; only to the extent the information is relevant to the requesting agencies'
 function. See, 74 F.R. 14890 (2009), and as amended from time to time for additional background and other routine uses.
 Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3401) -- This is notice to you as required by the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, of
 SBA's access rights to financial records held by financial institutions that are or have been doing business with you or your business, including any
 financial institutions participating in a loan or loan guaranty. The law provides that SBA shall have a right of access to your financial records in
 connection with its consideration or administration of assistance to you in the form of a Government guaranteed loan. SBA is required to provide a
 certificate of its compliance with the Act to a financial institution in connection with its first request for access to your financial records, after which
 no further certification is required for subsequent accesses. The law also provides that SBA's access rights continue for the term of any approved
 loan guaranty agreement. No further notice to you of SBA's access rights is required during the term of any such agreement. The law also
 authorizes SBA to transfer to another Government authority any financial records included in an application for a loan, or concerning an approved
 loan or loan guarantee, as necessary to process, service or foreclose on a loan guaranty or collect on a defaulted loan guaranty.
 Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) -- This law provides, with some exceptions, that SBA must supply information reflected in agency
 files and records to a person requesting it. Information about approved loans that will be automatically released includes, among other things,
 statistics on our loan programs (individual borrowers are not identified in the statistics) and other information such as the names of the borrowers
 (and their officers, directors, stockholders or partners), the collateral pledged to secure the loan, the amount of the loan, its purpose in general terms
 and the maturity. Proprietary data on a borrower would not routinely be made available to third parties. All requests under this Act are to be
 addressed to the nearest SBA office and be identified as a Freedom of Information request.
 Flood Disaster Protection Act (42 U.S.C. 4011) -- Regulations have been issued by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) and by SBA
 implementing this Act and its amendments. These regulations prohibit SBA from making certain loans in an FIA designated floodplain unless
 Federal Flood insurance is purchased as a condition of the loan. Failure to maintain the required level of flood insurance makes the applicant
 ineligible for any financial assistance from SBA, including disaster assistance.
 Executive Orders -- Floodplain Management and Wetland Protection (42 F.R. 26951 and 42 F.R. 26961) -- SBA discourages settlement in or
 development of a floodplain or a wetland. This statement is to notify all SBA loan applicants that such actions are hazardous to both life and
 property and should be avoided. The additional cost of flood preventive construction must be considered in addition to the possible loss of all assets
 and investments due to a future flood.
 Occupational Safety and Health Act (15 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) -- This legislation authorizes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in
 the Department of Labor to require businesses to modify facilities and procedures to protect employees or pay penalty fees. Businesses can be
 forced to cease operations or be prevented from starting operations in a new facility. Therefore, SBA may require additional information from an
 applicant to determine whether the business will be in compliance with OSHA regulations and allowed to operate its facility after the loan is
 approved and disbursed. Signing this form as an applicant is certification that the OSHA requirements that apply to the applicant business have been
 determined and that the applicant, to the best of its knowledge, is in compliance. Furthermore, applicant certifies that it will remain in compliance
 during the life of the loan.

 Civil Rights Legislation (13 C.F.R. 112, 113, 117) -- All businesses receiving SBA financial assistance must agree not to discriminate in any
 business practice, including employment practices and services to the public on the basis of categories cited in 13 C.F.R., Parts 112, 113, and 117
 of SBA Regulations. This includes making their goods and services available to handicapped clients or customers. All business borrowers will be
 required to display the "Equal Employment Opportunity Poster" prescribed by SBA.

 Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691) -- The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against
 credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a
 binding contract); because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good
 faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
 Executive Order 11738 -- Environmental Protection (38 F.R. 251621) -- The Executive Order charges SBA with administering its loan programs
 in a manner that will result in effective enforcement of the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Act and other environment protection
 legislation.
 Debt Collection Act of 1982, Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq. and other titles) -- These laws require SBA to collect
 aggressively any loan payments which become delinquent. SBA must obtain your taxpayer identification number when you apply for a loan. If you
 receive a loan, and do not make payments as they come due, SBA may take one or more of the following actions: (1) report the status of your
 loan(s) to credit bureaus, (2) hire a collection agency to collect your loan, (3) offset your income tax refund or other amounts due to you from the
 Federal Government, (4) suspend or debar you or your company from doing business with the Federal Government, (5) refer your loan to the
 Department of Justice or other attorneys for litigation, or (6) foreclose on collateral or take other action permitted in the loan instruments.
 Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-603) -- If you are an alien who was in this country illegally since before January 1,
 1982, you may have been granted lawful temporary resident status by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service pursuant to the
 Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. For five years from the date you are granted such status, you are not eligible for financial assistance
 from the SBA in the form of a loan guaranty under Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act unless you are disabled or a Cuban or Haitian entrant.
 When you sign this document, you are making the certification that the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 does not apply to you, or if it
 does apply, more than five years have elapsed since you have been granted lawful temporary resident status pursuant to such 1986 legislation.
 Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821 et seq.) -- Borrowers using SBA funds for the construction or rehabilitation of a
 residential structure are prohibited from using lead-based paint (as defined in SBA regulations) on all interior surfaces, whether accessible or not,
 and exterior surfaces, such as stairs, decks, porches, railings, windows and doors, which are readily accessible to children under 7 years of age. A
 "residential structure" is any home, apartment, hotel, motel, orphanage, boarding school, dormitory, day care center, extended care facility, college
 or other school housing, hospital, group practice or community facility and all other residential or institutional structures where persons reside.
 Executive Order 12549, Debarment and Suspension (2 CFR 180, adopted by reference in 2 CFR Part 2700 (SBA Debarment Regulations))
 -- By submission of this loan application, you certify and acknowledge that neither you nor any Principals have within the past three years been: (a)
 debarred, suspended, declared ineligible from participating in, or voluntarily excluded from participation in a transaction by any Federal department
 or agency; (b) formally proposed for debarment, with a final determination still pending; (c) indicted, convicted, or had a civil judgment rendered
 against you for any of the offenses listed in the Regulations; or (d) delinquent on any amounts due and owing to the U.S. Government or its agencies
 or instrumentalities as of the date of execution of this certification.

 If you are unable to certify and acknowledge (a) through (d), you must obtain and attach a written statement of exception from SBA permitting
 participation in this loan. You further certify that you have not and will not knowingly enter into any agreement in connection with the goods
 and/or services purchased with the proceeds of this loan with any individual or entity that has been debarred, suspended, declared ineligible from
 participating in, or voluntarily excluded from participation in a Transaction. All capitalized terms have the meanings set forth in 2 C.F.R. Part 180.
