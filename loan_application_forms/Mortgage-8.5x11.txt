This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender’s assistance. Applicants should complete this form as “Borrower” or “Co-Borrower,” as applicable. Co-
Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when               
                                                                                            the income or assets of a person other than the “Borrower” (including the Borrower’s spouse)
will be used as a basis for loan qualification or   the income or assets of the Borrower’s spouse or other person who has community property rights pursuant to state law will not be
used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person has community property rights pursuant to applicable law and
Borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is located in a community property state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community prop-
erty state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

If this is an application for joint credit, Borrower and Co-Borrower each agree that we intend to apply for joint credit (sign below):

                                                        PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING CREDIT
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and
record information that identifies each person who obtains credit.
What this means for you: When you obtain credit, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify
you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.

NOTICE: We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be
reflected in your credit report.

NOTICE TO MARRIED APPLICANTS: No provision of any marital property agreement, unilateral statement under §766.59, Wis. Stats., or court decree
under §766.70 adversely affects the interest of the creditor unless the creditor, prior to the time the credit is granted or an open-end credit plan is entered
into, is furnished a copy of the agreement, statement or decree or has actual knowledge of the adverse provision.

I/We fully understand that it is a Federal crime punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both, to knowingly make any false statements concerning any of the above facts as applicable under
the provisions of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, et seq.

                         CRITICAL CLIENT INFORMATION REGARDING DEBT AND CREDIT



Thank you for allowing us to assist you with your home financing needs. Our top priority is to provide
our clients with outstanding, personalized service and a stress-free mortgage process. To help ensure
there are no surprises and your loan closes as expected, it is of critical importance that you are aware of
the following:

All existing and new debts must be considered for qualification purposes prior to funding your loan. This
means that your file could be subject to a pre-funding check to verify that:

    •   You have not acquired any new debt or opened any new accounts/loans;
    •   Your current loan balances have not increased (applies to loans, credit cards, lines of credit, etc.)
    •   You do not have any new delinquencies on any existing account or any new public records
        (judgments, bankruptcies, etc.)
    •   Your credit score has not decreased.

These requirements apply to the borrower and any co-borrowers on the loan. If any of the above
changes are discovered through verification or obtaining of a new credit report, the file is subject to re-
qualification and/or re-underwriting.

If we must re-qualify and/or re-underwrite your loan, you must qualify with your updated debt and
credit profile. If you no longer qualify, we may not be able to fund your loan and any charges incurred
would be your responsibility.

If you suspect your credit or debt profile may have changed at any point between your approval and
