                Electronic Identity Verification
   If you are new to NAB we will need to verify your identify. NAB is progressively rolling out enhanced system capability to manage it’s
   identity verification process. We may be able to perform electronic verification in some circumstances, if you agree to it.
   Electronic identity verification means that NAB may provide your name, address and date of birth to a credit reporting body (CRB), such
   as Equifax, and ask it to provide an assessment of whether the information provided matches information already held by the CRB. The CRB
   will use the information provided by NAB in addition to its own information to make its assessment. This is NOT a credit check.
   In addition where identification documents such as Passport or driver’s licence are used for identification purposes. NAB may contact the
   authority that issued the documents to verify them by using the Government’s Document Verification Service.
   You do not have to be verified electronically, instead you may choose to provide 100 points of identification in person.
   If available, do you consent to electronic identity verification for this application?

          Linking an existing credit card to your package
  For Home Loan package customers, your existing NAB credit card account may be eligible for a waiver of its annual card fee.
  If you have not already done so and wish to link your existing credit card account to your home loan package and receive the fee waiver please
  provide your eligible card number below.


  Note: If you have successfully applied for an eligible NAB credit card account in conjunction with your home loan application and have not
  provided another eligible existing credit card number to NAB (on this form or otherwise) we will link your new credit card account to your
  home loan package so that you can receive the fee waiver (unless you tell us otherwise).
