                       Medical Claim Form


What is this form for?
This form is for out-of-network claims ONLY, to ask for payment for eligible health care you have received.
To ensure faster processing of your claim, be sure to do the following:
If you write on the form, use black or blue ink and print clearly and legibly. You can also use your computer to complete
this form and then print it out to mail it to us. Complete all of the applicable felds on the form. Ask your provider for the
Provider Information, or have them fll that out for you. Be sure to submit a separate form for each claim.
If you have other insurance or Medicare and it is primary to your UnitedHealthcare plan, please include the explanation
of benefts (EOB) from your other insurance or Medicare.
Ask your provider to complete the Provider Information section on the form (below). All of the information in
that section is required to process the claim.

Ask your provider to give you a Superbill or Invoice that includes all of the following
for each date of service:
IMPORTANT: This information must be on the Superbill as it is required to process the claim. Missing information can
result in a delay or non-payment of the claim. Please be sure the information is clear and readable.
• Patient Name

• Units for each procedure code.
• The billed amount for each procedure code.
