           Health Reimbursement Account (HRA)
           Mandatory Second Payer (MSP) Form

Mandatory reporting requirements apply to all HRA participants and their spouse/dependents as a result of Section 111 of the
Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007. These Mandatory Second Payer (MSP) rules ensure that Medicare does
not pay for medical claims that should be first paid by another source and are designed to identify which entity is the primary
payer. You are required to complete this form. If you do not have any dependents, only complete the “Your Information” sec-
tion. If you are not eligible for, or currently participating in, a Medicare related program, you must still report basic census infor-
mation for yourself and each of your dependents. Dependents are the individuals claimed on your Federal Tax Return
(examples: spouse, children, etc). Please complete a second form to report additional dependents if necessary.

Use one of the Plan Code’s below to indicate the account from which payment should be made. Your employer may not offer
all the benefit types listed below and certain restrictions may apply. If your employer offers multiple benefit types, Lifetime
Benefit Solutions will process the reimbursement based on the rules established by your employer. For example, if you have
both an FSA and HRA account, and your employer has identified the FSA as the “pay first” account, your expenses will be
applied to your FSA until the balance is depleted with any additional expenses applied to your HRA.

For All Account Types (FSA, HRA, Parking/Transit, RRA, Insurance Premium)
   For faster reimbursement processing you may be able to submit your claims online at www.lifetimebenfitsolutions.com.
   Complete the top section, including Social Security Number or Employee ID.
   Submit one expense (either a product or service) per row, even if items are contained on the same receipt.
   Label the receipts to correspond to the Claim Ref #.
   If you have more items than the form can accept, use additional forms.
   Do not “lump” or group items together or write See Attached.
   All claims are subject to deadlines, as defined in your Summary Plan Description (SPD).
   The expenses you submit must qualify as valid expenses under the terms of the Plan, and the claimant receiving the ser-
     vices must be a qualifying individual as defined in the Plan.
   Lifetime Benefit Solutions can only process claims that are properly submitted. Claims that are not properly submitted may
     be delayed or denied.
   Retain a copy of the Reimbursement Request Form and receipts for your own personal records; Lifetime Benefit Solutions
     is not responsible for retaining copies of your receipts beyond the current Plan year.

     hours.

Reporting Medical Mileage
   Medical mileage rates are set by the IRS and can be applied to transportation primarily for and essential to medical care.
   Indicate the total number of miles incurred with each service provided (i.e. round trip miles to visit the doctor).
   Lifetime Benefit Solutions will apply the current mileage rate and include the mileage amount in your total reimbursement.
   You may be required to produce additional documentation for each mileage expense you claim.

Medical Claims for FSA, HRA and RRA
   For each medical claim covered by your insurance carrier, submit an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). If your claims are not
     submitted to your insurance carrier, provide an itemized bill showing: date of service, provider name, patient name,
     charged amount, and description of services rendered.
   Do not send credit card receipts, original receipts or cancelled checks.
   The IRS states that Over-the-Counter (OTC) items classified as drugs and medicine are only eligible if they are accompanied
     by a doctor’s prescription.
   Use Plan Code M to report medical mileage associated with a Debit Card transaction. For example, if you drove 20 miles to
     a doctor’s appointment, and paid your copayment amount with the Debit Card, you should use Plan Code M to be reim-
     bursed for the 20 miles you drove. You should still complete the full line of information, but you will only be reimbursed for
     the mileage, not the copayment amount.

Dependent Care Claims
   Please use the separate form titled Dependent Care Account Reimbursement Request Form.

Parking/Transit Claims
   Receipts are not required as long as page one of this form is properly completed and separate claims are itemized on sepa-
     rate claim lines.
   The only type of parking that is eligible for tax-free reimbursement is qualified parking on (or near) the employer’s facility,
     or on (or near) a location from which the employee commutes to work by public transportation. If the parking is on (or
     near) the employee’s residence, it is not eligible for tax-free reimbursement.
Individual Insurance Premium
   The bill from the insurance carrier must identify participant, premium amount, coverage period, and policy number.

                                                                                                                             Page 2 of 2
