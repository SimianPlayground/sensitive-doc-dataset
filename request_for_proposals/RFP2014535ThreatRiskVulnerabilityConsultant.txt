           WILLIAMSBURG-JAMES CITY COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOL DIVISION
                           REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS
                                 No. 20-14534
      CONSULTANT SERVICES FOR THREAT, RISK AND VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

I.        Purpose:

      James City County, Virginia (“the County”) on behalf of the Williamsburg-James City County Public
      School Division (“the Division”) is requesting proposals from qualified, interested parties to assess,
      identify recommendations and produce findings for the Williamsburg James City County Public School
      Division building and property. Consultants are invited to submit a proposal which includes an outline of
      their experience and qualifications in performing work directly related to the services required.

          Statement of Needs:

      STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
      In light of recent school tragedies, WJCC Public Schools is soliciting bids for a school security assessment
      to be performed on the school’s divisions building and property. The division is ultimately looking for
      qualified bidders to report the findings, commendations, and recommendations for both short term and long
      term security improvements. The security assessment provides decision makers with an audit of existing
      environmental conditions and future implications based on site design, access, and nature of business
      operations. It addresses the opportunity to identify security strengths and deficiencies while providing
      recommendations for improving these conditions through corrective security countermeasures.

II.       Background and Scope of Project:

      Scope of Project:

      Williamsburg / James City County School Division (hereinafter referred to as “WJCC”) intends to procure
      the services to conduct a Vulnerability and Risk Review (hereinafter referred to as the “Review”) of the
      Sixteen (16) Williamsburg / James City County Public Schools, the Central Office Building and the
      Operations Center.
      The proposal should outline in detail the methodology or approach, and best practices and industry standards
      incorporated in the methodology. In addition, a detailed timeline for completion of the project is required.
      The proposal should include but is not limited to the following:

      Scope of basic Services:

      • Conduct interviews with school personnel as appropriate which may include principals, faculty, staff,
      security personnel, school resource officers, and maintenance personnel.

      for safety and security matters.
      • Review of current operations, operating procedures and protective systems/measures currently in use.
      • Review of the types of crimes and/or incidents that have occurred in or around each facility for the previous
      twelve months.
      • Review of any available information or intelligence related to the safety or security of each of the facilities.
      • Review of any known threats made against the facilities or personnel assigned to each location.
      • Review of critical assets and redundancies.
      • Review of access control measures at all eighteen (18) facilities.

      • Complete a School Safety Inspection Checklist (as defined by the Virginia Department of Criminal
      Services and the Virginia Department of Education) for the sixteen (16) schools, the Central Office Building,
      and the Operations Center.
      • Conduct an In-brief and Out-brief of the Review with WJCC staff.
  • Provide a detailed written report to include commendations and recommendations for reducing risks and
  vulnerabilities.
  • Provide priority levels of consideration and urgency for recommendations, where appropriate.

III.        PROPOSAL PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION

       A.        GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:

                 1.   RFP Response: In order to be considered for selection, offerors must submit a complete response
                      to this RFP. One (1) original and six (6) copies of each proposal must be submitted to the
                      Division as a complete sealed proposal. No other distribution of the proposal shall be made by
                      the offeror.

                 2.   Proposal Preparation:

                      a.   Proposals shall be signed by an authorized representative of the offeror. All information
                           requested should be submitted. Failure to submit all information requested may result in
                           the Division requiring prompt submission of missing information and/or giving a lowered
                           evaluation of the proposal. Proposals which are substantially incomplete or lack key
                           information may be rejected by the Division. Mandatory requirements are those required
                           by law or regulation or are such that they cannot be waived and are not subject to
                           negotiation.

                      b.   Proposals should be prepared simply and economically, providing a straightforward,
                           concise description of capabilities to satisfy the requirements of the RFP. Emphasis should
                           be placed on completeness and clarity of content.

                      c.   Proposals should be organized in the order in which the requirements are presented in the
                           RFP. All pages of the proposal should be numbered. Each paragraph in the proposal should
                           reference the paragraph number of the corresponding section of the RFP. It is also helpful
                           to cite the paragraph number, subletter, and repeat the text of the requirement as it appears
                           in the RFP. If a response covers more than one page, the paragraph number and subletter
                           should be repeated at the top of the next page. The proposal should contain a table of
                           contents which cross-references the RFP requirements. Information which the offeror
                           desires to present that does not fall within any of the requirements of the RFP should be
                           inserted at an appropriate place or be attached at the end of the proposal and designated as
                           additional material. Proposals that are not organized in this manner risk elimination from
                           consideration if the evaluators are unable to find where the RFP requirements are
                           specifically addressed.

            d.        As used in this RFP, the terms "must", "shall", "should" and “may” identify the criticality of
                          requirements. "Must" and "shall" identify requirements whose absence will have a major
                          negative impact on the suitability of the proposed solution. Items labeled as "should" or
                          “may” are highly desirable, although their absence will not have a large impact and would
                          be useful, but are not necessary. Depending on the overall response to the RFP, some
                          individual "must" and "shall" items may not be fully satisfied, but it is the intent to satisfy
                          most, if not all, "must" and "shall" requirements. The inability of an Offeror to satisfy a
                          "must" or "shall" requirement does not automatically remove that Offeror from
                          consideration; however, it may seriously affect the overall rating of the Offerors’ proposal.

                      e.   Each copy of the proposal should be bound or contained in a single volume where practical.
                           All documentation submitted with the proposal should be contained in that single volume.

                      f.   All costs of proposal preparation and presentation shall be borne by each offeror. The
                           Division is not liable for any cost incurred by the offeror prior to issuance of a contract.
3.   Oral Presentation: Offerors who submit a proposal in response to this RFP may be required to give an oral
     presentation of their proposal to the Division. This provides an opportunity for the offeror to clarify or elaborate
     on the proposal. This is a fact finding and explanation session only and does not include negotiation. The
     Division will schedule the time and location of these presentations. Oral presentations are an option of the
     Division and may or may not be conducted.


B. SPECIFIC PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS:

     Interested parties are invited to respond to this RFP by submitting a proposal. Proposals should include ideas,
     information and recommendations that could result in a methodology for the strategic plan, suggestions for

These CONDITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS shall be binding on all bidders or offerors and are incorporated by
reference in all contracts resulting from any written Request for Quotes, Invitation to Bid or Request for Proposals issued, collectively
the (“Request”), to which they are attached. Use of the term “bid” in these General Terms & Conditions and Instructions to Bidders is

Proposals. The Purchasing Office is responsible for the purchasing activity of James City County, a political subdivision of the
Commonwealth of Virginia, and the James City Service Authority, herein referred to collectively as “James City County” or “County”.
Bidder/Offeror or their authorized representatives are expected to inform themselves fully as to the conditions, requirements, and
specifications before submitting bids/proposals: failure to do so will be at the bidder’s/offeror’s own risk and except as provided by law,
relief cannot be secured on the plea of error.

Subject to all Federal, State and local laws, policies, resolutions, regulations, rules, limitations and legislation including the County
Purchasing Policy and the County Purchasing Manual, bids/proposals on all solicitations issued by the Purchasing Office will bind
bidders/ offerors to applicable conditions and requirements herein set forth unless otherwise specified in the solicitation.

bodies, governmental jurisdictions and school divisions as may be interested. Should other entities decide to use the final contract, the
contractor shall deal directly with that jurisdiction or political subdivision concerning the placement of orders, issuance of the purchase
orders, contractual disputes, invoicing and payments. James City County acts only as the “Contracting Agent” for these jurisdictions

contract.

Each participating public body, jurisdiction and political subdivisions has the option of executing a separate contract with the contractor.
Such contracts may contain general terms and conditions unique to those jurisdictions and political subdivisions. If, when preparing
such a contract, the general terms and conditions of a jurisdiction are unacceptable to the contractor, the contractor may withdraw its
extension of the award to that jurisdiction.

James City County shall not be held liable for any costs or damages incurred by another public body or jurisdiction as a result of any
award extended to that public body, jurisdiction or political subdivision by the contractor.
