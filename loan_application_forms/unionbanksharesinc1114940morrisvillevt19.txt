*Vermont law recognizes a homestead right in the spouse or civil union partner of the
legal owner of real estate, which is used or kept as their primary home, even if the
spouse or civil union partner is not a co-owner of that home. This homestead interest
prevents creditors from attaching the entire homestead property without the written
consent of both spouses or partners. Therefore, the lender will require that both
spouses or civil union partners sign the mortgage deed, or otherwise waive their
homestead interest in the property, in order to insure that it is fully enforceable.

This Addendum has been prepared in response to Act 91 of the 2000 Legislative
Session, effective July 1, 2000, which provides that parties to a civil union shall have all
the same benefits, protections, and responsibilities afforded under Vermont law to
spouses in a marriage.

You should consult an attorney for specific legal advice regarding homestead rights and
for specific legal advice regarding benefits, protections, and responsibilities under Act
91.

                                                                    Vermont Residential Energy Code
                                                                         Disclosure Statement

On May 7, 1997, the Vermont Legislature enacted the Vermont Residential Energy Code (officially called the
“Residential Building Energy Standards”). If you are building a new single family dwelling, two family
dwelling, multi-family dwelling three stories in height or less or building an addition to your existing home
which is 500 square feet or more, there are certain energy requirements that must be met. This is effective
for all residential construction that was begun on or after July 1, 1998.

Enclosed is a brochure on the Energy Code with general information. For more detailed information for
builders, the Vermont Department of Public Service and Energy Code Assistance Center have also
published a 65 page “Vermont Residential Energy Code Handbook” that specifies the requirements for
complying with the Code.

CONTRACTOR-BUILT HOMES AND ADDITIONS
Your builder or contractor is required to certify that your new home or addition is built to these standards.
Within 30 day of completion of construction, your builder must:
        1) Fill out a “VT Residential Building Energy Standards Certificate”;
        2) Post the Certificate in the home;
        3) Send a copy of the Certificate to the Department of Public Service and file and index a copy in
            the town land records; and
        4) Provide a copy of the Certificate to be included in your file with this lending institution. (This is
            not required by law, but is a policy of this lender).

OWNER/BUILDER HOMES AND ADDITIONS
The Energy Code statute allows for an “owner/builder” to build a home or addition that does not meet the
standards. To be considered an “owner/builder” the home must be used as a dwelling by the owner/builder
and the owner/builder must direct the details of construction.

As an owner/builder, if the home does not meet the Code, when you decide to sell, you must disclose, in
writing, to a prospective buyer, before entering into a binding purchase and sales agreement, the nature and
extent of any non-compliance with the standards. This written statement must itemize which measures do
not meet the Code using the “Vermont Owner/Builder Disclosure Statement”. This Statement must be filed
with the Department of Public Service and filed and recorded in the town land records within 30 days
following the sale by you, the owner. Your lender may require a copy of this Statement at closing.

If an owner/builder home will meet the Code, a copy of the “VT Residential Building Energy Standards
Certificate” should be completed, posted in the home, filed with the Department of Public Service and filed
and recorded in the town land records within 30 days following the completion of construction. Your lender
may require a copy of this Certificate at closing.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I have read this statement and understand my obligations under the Energy Code as presented here and in
the accompanying materials.

This Disclosure Statement was produced by the Vermont Department of Public Service (DPS), and the DPS

                                    COLLECT YOUR MORTGAGE LOAN PAYMENTS MAY BE TRANSFERRED.

      You are applying for a mortgage loan covered by the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) (12
      U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). RESPA gives you certain rights under Federal law. This statement describes whether
      the servicing for this loan may be transferred to a different loan servicer. "Servicing" refers to collecting
      your principal, interest, and escrow payments, if any, as well as sending any monthly or annual statements,
      tracking account balances, and handling other aspects of your loan. You will be given advance notice before
      a transfer occurs.

        X    We may assign, sell, or transfer the servicing of your loan while the loan is outstanding.

             We do not service mortgage loans of the type for which you applied. We intend to assign, sell, or
             transfer the servicing of your mortgage loan before the first payment is due.

             The loan for which you have applied will be serviced at this financial institution and we do not intend
             to sell, transfer, or assign the servicing of the loan.
