SBA Disaster Assistance in Response to the Coronavirus
•   The U.S. Small Business Administration is offering designated states and territories low-
    interest federal disaster loans for working capital to small businesses suffering substantial
    economic injury as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). Upon a request received from a
    state’s or territory’s Governor, SBA will issue under its own authority, as provided by the
    Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act that was
    recently signed by the President, an Economic Injury Disaster Loan declaration.

•   Any such Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance declaration issued by the SBA makes
    loans available statewide to small businesses and private, non-profit organizations to
    help alleviate economic injury caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19).

•   SBA’s Office of Disaster Assistance will coordinate with the state’s or territory’s Governor
    to submit the request for Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance.

•   Once a declaration is made, the information on the application process for Economic
    Injury Disaster Loan assistance will be made available to affected small businesses within
    the state.

•   SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loans offer up to $2 million in assistance and can provide
    vital economic support to small businesses to help overcome the temporary loss of
    revenue they are experiencing.

•   These loans may be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable and other bills that
    can’t be paid because of the disaster’s impact. The interest rate is 3.75% for small
    businesses. The interest rate for non-profits is 2.75%.

•   SBA offers loans with long-term repayments in order to keep payments affordable, up to a
    maximum of 30 years. Terms are determined on a case-by-case basis, based upon each
    borrower’s ability to repay.

•   SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loans are just one piece of the expanded focus of the
    federal government’s coordinated response, and the SBA is strongly committed to
    providing the most effective and customer-focused response possible.
