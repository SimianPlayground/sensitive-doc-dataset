Health Reimbursement Account (HRA)
Frequently Asked Questions

Do you like knowing what you’re spending on health care costs? Do you want to pay for
those costs using tax-free money from your employer? Then a Health Reimbursement
Account (HRA) may be just the right thing for you. It puts your health care spending in your
hands, which is pretty cool.

Q   What’s an HRA?
A   HRA stands for health reimbursement account. It’s a type of health plan your employer sponsors. Your
    employer sets aside money – your HRA – for health care costs. You can use it to help pay for eligible
    medical expenses. Money from the HRA helps you pay your health plan deductibles, coinsurance and
    copayments. Money you don’t use may be able to be used for future medical costs, depending on your
    employer’s plan.


Q   What are deductibles, coinsurance and copayments?
A   A deductible is what you’re in charge of paying before your plan kicks in to cover costs. For example, if your
    deductible is $2,000, you pay all expenses up to $2,000.
    After you reach your deductible, you’ll pay a portion of the bill. It could be a percentage, called coinsurance.
    Or it could be a set dollar amount, called a copayment (or copay, for short).


Q   How does the HRA work?
A   Your employer decides how much they’ll set aside in your HRA each year. When you or someone on your
    plan has an eligible medical expense, your HRA can help pay for it. You can use the money in your HRA to
    pay for some or all of your deductible, coinsurance or copays. Every employer’s plan is different, so check
    with your employer for details about your health plan and HRA. Once you’ve used all of the money in your
    HRA you’ll need to pay for expenses from your own funds for the rest of the year.


Q   How much does my employer put into my HRA?
A   Typical employer contributions are one-half of the deductible amount of the health plan. For example, let’s
    say the health plan has a $2,000 deductible per individual employee and $4,000 deductible per family. This
    means the employer’s typical HRA contribution would be $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for families.
    Every employer’s plan is different, so check with your employer for details about your health plan and HRA.

Q   What if my family status changes?
A   If you change from single health coverage to family coverage during the plan year (or vice-versa), the HRA
    money from your employer usually follows the deductible. For single to family changes, the family HRA
    contribution is based on the date your coverage began. For family to single changes, the single HRA
    amount is applied at the time of the change. If you’ve already used more than the single contribution
    amount, you don’t have to worry about the difference


Q   Are there contribution limits?
A   There are no annual or lifetime contribution limits. Each employer will set limits for the plan they’re offering.


Q   What are the tax benefits of an HRA?
A   The money in your HRA was given to you by your employer and it’s not reported as income. So you’re
    getting tax-free money to use for your medical needs.


Q   Does the money in my HRA earn interest?
A   No. An HRA is not a bank account. Your employer holds the money until you have an eligible medical
    expense.


Q   What are eligible medical expenses?
A   Your employer decides what can be reimbursed from your HRA. Generally, employers allow reimbursement
    only for medical expenses covered under the health plan, like doctor visits, chiropractor fees and
    prescription medicines.


Q   How do I pay for expenses using my HRA?
A   You can use money in your HRA a few ways:
    1. Automatic submission – When you go to a network doctor or pharmacy, the medical claim is sent
       directly to HealthPartners. Then, if you’re responsible for payment, it’s passed along to your HRA. As
       long as your HRA has money available, it pays the bill directly to the clinic or pharmacy. On the other
       hand, some employers have HRA plans where the HRA money is paid directly to you, and you’re in
       charge of paying the bill to your clinic or pharmacy. Check with your employer for details about your
       specific plan.
        Note: You can opt out of the automatic submission feature. You must opt out of automatic submission if
        you have another health plan through a spouse or you have a dependent covered under your health
        plan who doesn’t meet federal tax code rules.
    2. Debit card – Some employers offer the option of a debit card to pay for eligible medical expenses. The
       card allows HRA reimbursement at the point of service (for example, at the clinic or pharmacy) or it can
       be used to pay a provider bill.

    3. Online and mobile submission – You can submit your expenses from your myHealthPartners
       account. You should submit your expenses online or in the app if you don’t have automatic submission.
        •   Online: Log on to healthpartners.com. Go to the My plan tab, then select My Accounts under
            Spending. Select Health Reimbursement Account, then Submit a claim for payment.
        •   myHP mobile app: Log on and select My Plan from the bottom of the screen. Then select Request
            Reimbursement. In less than two minutes, you can snap a photo of your document and submit the
            form.
    4. Manual submission – You can get money from your HRA by mailing or faxing a health care expense
       claim form. Manual claim submission is typically used when you go to an out-of-network doctor or your
       eligible expense isn’t sent directly to HealthPartners. Reimbursement from your HRA will be sent to you
       by direct deposit or paper check. Forms are online at healthpartners.com/myhra or you can call
       Member Services at 952-883-7000 or 866-443-9352. Be sure to send documentation with your
       reimbursement request form.


Q   How soon will I get my reimbursement?
A   You’re typically reimbursed from your HRA within 10 to 14 days. If your request is held or denied, we’ll send
    you an email or letter.


Q   How do I sign up for direct deposit?
A   The fastest way to get your reimbursement is to sign up for direct deposit. Forms and directions are
    available on healthpartners.com/myhra. You can also call Member Services at 952-883-7000 or
    866-443-9352.


Q   How do I keep track of my HRA balance?
A   You can check your HRA balance anytime by logging on to healthpartners.com or the myHP app. When
    there’s a request for reimbursement from your HRA, HealthPartners will send you a payment summary. It
    lets you know how much money was taken out of your HRA and how much is left.


Q   What happens to the money in my HRA if I don’t use it all in one year?
A   Every employer has different rules for their HRA. Some employers will let you carry over all or some of your
    HRA balance to the next year. Other employers will keep any money you don’t spend. Check with your
    employer for details.


Q   What happens to the money in the HRA if I leave my employer?
A   Usually unused HRA balances are given to the employer when you leave. However, your employer might let
    you continue to use your HRA money for eligible medical expenses. Check with your employer for details.




                                                                                                           Page 3 of 4
Q      Can I use my HRA balance if I choose COBRA?
A      Yes, most of the time, but check with your employer to find out. If you choose COBRA when you leave your
       job, usually you’ll get the same plan choices. Sometimes, the health plan doesn’t include the actual HRA. In
       this case, you’d be able to choose the health plan option, but not get any more employer contributions to
       your HRA.


Q      How can I get more information on my HRA?
A      When you sign up for your HRA, you’ll get a Summary Plan Description that tells you about the plan details.
       You can also call Member Services with any questions at 952-883-7000 or 866-443-9352.
