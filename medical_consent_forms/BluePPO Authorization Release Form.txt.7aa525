                               AUTHORIZATION TO SHARE MY PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION


      To comply with Federal HIPAA regulations, health plans must obtain a member’s permission to share that
      member’s protected health information with any other person. There are limited exceptions to this rule.
      Until a child reaches age 18, parents may access most of their child’s health information without first
      obtaining the child’s permission. However, regardless of the child’s age, parents do not have access to
      diagnosis or treatment information, including payment information, for venereal diseases, abortion, and drug
      and alcohol abuse, unless the child specifically authorizes the release of such information.

      As a member, you can use this form to authorize us to share your protected health information. Each person
      you identify will have the same access to your information. If you would like each person to access
      different information or to have access to your information for a different period of time, you’ll need to
      complete separate forms for each individual or time period.

      This authorization will include the disclosure of information relating to genetic testing, alcohol and drug
      abuse, mental health (excluding psychotherapy notes), abortion, and venereal disease information only if
      you place your initials on the corresponding line in Step 2. Additionally, if you would like to authorize us to
      release information regarding HIV/AIDS, a different form must be completed. To obtain a copy of this
      form please contact our office at the telephone number listed on your identification card, or access the form
      at the following website: http://www.health.state.ny.us/diseases/aids/forms/informedconsent.htm.

      Your authorization is completely voluntary. We will not condition your enrollment in a health plan,
      eligibility for benefits, or payment of claims on giving this authorization. If you need additional forms, you
      may copy this form, visit our Web site at: www.excellusbcbs.com/download/forms/authform.pdf, or contact
      our office at the telephone number listed on your identification card.

      As permitted by law, we will continue to communicate to providers of care involved in your treatment: (1)
      our payment activities in connection with your claims, (2) your enrollment in our health plan and (3) your
      eligibility for benefits.



     Please check here if you would like to authorize access to psychotherapy notes. If this box is checked,
      then this authorization cannot be used for another reason. If checked, steps two and three below can
      be skipped.
