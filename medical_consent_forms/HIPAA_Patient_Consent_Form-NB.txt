                               HIPAA Patient Consent Form
I understand that I have certain rights to privacy regarding my protected health information.
These rights are given to me under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 (HIPAA). I understand that by signing this consent I authorize Dr. Conte to use and disclose
my protected health information to carry out:

    •   Treatment (Including direct and indirect treatment by other healthcare
        providers involved in my treatment);
    •   Obtaining payment from third party payers (i.e. my insurance company);
        the day to day healthcare operations of our practice.
I have also been informed of and given the right to review and secure a copy of our Notice of
Privacy Practices, which contains a more complete description of the uses and disclosures of my
protected health information and my rights under HIPAA. I understand that the office reserves
the right to change the terms of this notice from time to time and that patients may contact us
at any time to obtain the most current copy of this notice.


I understand that I have the right to request restrictions on how my protected health
information is used and disclosed to carry out treatment, payment and health care operations,
but that Dr. Conte is not required to agree to these requested restrictions. However, if Dr.
Conte does agree in writing, then he is bound to comply with this restriction.


I understand that I may revoke this consent, in writing at any time. However, any use or
disclosure that occurred prior to the date I revoke this consent is not affected.
