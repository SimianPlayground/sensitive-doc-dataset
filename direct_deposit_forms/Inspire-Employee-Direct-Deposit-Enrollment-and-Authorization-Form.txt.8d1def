             Employee Direct Deposit Enrollment and Authorization Form
                                       Company Name: Inspire Human Resources, LLC

To enroll in Direct Deposit, simply fill out this form and return it with your onboarding documents, or submit it to
Accounting via email (Accounting@InspireHumanResources.com). Attach a voided check for each checking account -
not a deposit slip. If depositing to a savings account, ask your bank to give you the Routing/Transit Number for your
account. It isn’t always the same as the number on a savings deposit slip. This will help ensure that you are paid correctly.

Below is a sample check MICR line, detailing where the information needed to complete this form can be found.
