                        Business Purpose/Commercial Loan Application
Applicants should complete this from (including the referenced addenda, if applicable) as “Borrower” or “Co-Borrower,” as applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be
provided (and the appropriate box checked) when ☐ the income or assets of a person other than the Borrower (including the Borrower’s spouse) will be used as a basis
for the loan qualification or ☐ the income or assets of the Borrower’s spouse or other person who has community property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a
basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other persona has community property rights pursuant to applicable law and
borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is located in a community property state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a
community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

NOTE: Borrower and Co-Borrower means an “applicant” for a potential loan. Once the application is completed, it is not to be considered a loan commitment from the lender
or the lenders’ broker for the requested loan. Any loan commitment from the lender or the lenders’ broker must be in writing and signed by either party.

If this is an application for joint credit, Borrower and Co-Borrower each agree that we intend to apply for the joint credit (sign below):
