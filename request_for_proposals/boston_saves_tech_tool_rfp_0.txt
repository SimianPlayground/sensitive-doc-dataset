CSA RFP                                                                                                                                          2
1/ Overview
Mayor Walsh’s administration is committed to helping Boston’s children achieve their dreams
beyond high school. Specifically, the City of Boston is working to increase access to
postsecondary education as a pathway to financial empowerment. The City’s Office of
Workforce Development (OWD) will launch a Children’s Savings Account for College (CSA)
program that will ultimately open a college savings account for every Kindergarten (K2) student.
We’re starting with a 3-year pilot program (to be launched in Fall 2016) and are looking for a
technology solution to support our work.

OWD wants to emerge as a national thought leader on CSA delivery, and we have learned that
leveraging technology can help us deliver a streamlined and dynamic Boston CSA Pilot Program.
Successful creation and implementation of this tool has the potential to scale beyond Boston,
as other CSA programs may be interested in such a tool in the near future.

OWD seeks engaged and flexible technology partner(s) who can help build a delivery
platform for the Boston CSA Pilot Program that:
    a. encourages Boston families to use their accounts,
    b. enables OWD to sustainably provide excellent customer service for Boston families,
    c. provides OWD with data that will help us improve the program,
    d. enables families to use multiple types of financial accounts across a variety of financial
        institutions and account types, and
    e. allows OWD the flexibility to iterate and adapt the program based on program
        performance and feedback.
This partner(s) would sign a 3-year contract to collaborate with OWD for the duration of the
Boston CSA Pilot Program. While this contract would cover the pilot period, OWD is looking
for a partner(s) with the capability to scale and sustain engagement longer-term.


1.1/ Project Background
Research1 and practice2 around the country strongly suggest that CSAs impact children’s
mindset towards college, their access to higher education, and their financial capability.
Therefore, as part of OWD’s work to ensure long-term economic success for Boston’s children,
OWD will partner with the Eos Foundation and the Boston Public Schools (BPS) to pilot a CSA
program.

Inspired by San Francisco’s Kindergarten to College (K2C) program, OWD will launch a universal
CSA program at the Kindergarten (K2) level. Every child entering kindergarten at a public school
(district or charter) in Boston will receive a CSA that remains with them for at least 12 years,
until he or she is ready to pursue post-secondary education. Families can deposit into the
accounts at any time and have an opportunity to earn incentives for their savings.

CSA RFP                                                                                                       3
The first step toward a universal program is a 3-year pilot beginning in the fall of 2016. OWD
will provide a CSA to an estimated 500 kindergarteners each year at three to five Boston Public
Schools, for an estimated total of 1,500 participants in the pilot’s third year.

Each student will receive a seed deposit for their CSA. Savings incentives (such as matching
funds and providing bonus funds for achieving particular benchmarks) will also be provided to
families who contribute to their accounts.3 Private dollars will be used to fund accounts during
the pilot phase. In addition, financial empowerment services, such as a financial education and
counseling, will be integrated into the effort in order to maximize the program’s
effectiveness. All program funds (seed deposit and savings incentives) will be held in a “Master
Account” owned by OWD/the City until participants are ready and able to withdraw their
savings (both family contributions and program funds earned) for post-secondary use.

We want to make it as easy as possible for families to access the accounts and make
deposits. With the exception of certain programmatic withdrawal restrictions, these accounts
will be used just like traditional savings accounts, with features like viewing account balances
online and making deposits online or at a bank.

With this in mind, we would like to give families two ways to access their CSA funds:
   1. Because our market research demonstrates that Boston families like choices, we would
       first like to give families the option to “link-your-own-account.” This option would be
       exactly what it sounds like--families would be able to open a savings account, or take an
       existing savings account, from any financial institution and designate it as their CSA
       account. The tech tool we want to develop through this RFP would be the way their
       account is “linked” to, or registered with, our program. This option gives families the
       ability to make deposits through the financial institution of their choosing.
   2. We would also like to give families the option to “create a custodial account.”45 For
       families that choose this option, OWD/the City would create a custodial savings account
       for the family, where there is an account custodian (aka primary account holder) and
       the child in the CSA program is the named beneficiary of the account. OWD will partner
       with a specific depository institution to create these accounts, and this is where families
       who chose this option would make deposits.6


3
  Any deposits from families directly are referred to as “family deposits.” And deposits from public or
private donors for the account seed or savings incentives are referred to as “program funds.”
4
  There are many reasons why families may choose this option; some reasons include, but are not limited
to: because they are unbanked, because keeping assets in their name may affect receipt of public
assistance benefits, or because the accounts they currently hold are serving other purposes.
5
  At the time of this RFP release, the exact account structure for these custodial accounts (e.g., individual
custodial account, escrow account with sub-accounts for each child) has not yet been determined and will
depend in part on the chosen financial partner (see footnote 6 below).
6
  At the time of this RFP release, a financial institution partner has not yet been identified. Should we
solidify a partner financial institution during the RFP process, we will post this information on the RFP
website and will alert those who have downloaded the RFP about this update via email.

CSA RFP                                                                                                     4
The tech tool we want to develop through this RFP will enable OWD to manage these variety of
accounts families opt for as part of a single CSA program, tracking program funds earned by
each family overtime as they make deposits and reach other program benchmarks.

We have three goals for the 3-year pilot program:
  1. Create a CSA program that results in high participation by families, and can be
      sustainably be scaled to accommodate ~5,000 new student accounts per year. One
      proof point for participation will be regular deposit activity from families. Appropriate
      targets for participation will be jointly developed with our partners during project
      startup.
  2. Learn from families and participating schools what program elements positively and
      negatively impact their participation, and adjust the CSA program accordingly.
  3. Learn from families, school building staff (teachers, principals), and community
      organizations what impact the CSA program is having on the mindset of Boston children
      and parents. This may include analyzing attendance and school performance data, and
      administering qualitative surveys.

These goals are in service of the primary goals of the full-scale program:
   1. Create a college-going culture in Boston and expectations that every child in Boston will
       enroll in and complete college or some form of post-secondary education.
   2. Increase the percentage of Boston’s children who graduate from high school, enroll in
       and complete college or some form of post-secondary education or training.
   3. Increase children and families’ financial capability to help create lifelong savings and
       investment habits, thereby increasing financial inclusion among many of the City’s
       disadvantaged residents.

2/ Project Scope
Because the tech tool will be a central pillar of our program, we are looking for specific
capabilities in the four parts of this project: the back end (2.1.), the front end (2.2), potential
future requirements (2.3), and sustainability & scalability (2.4).

OWD is looking for a technology partner(s) who will be contracted for the duration of the 3-
year pilot. The present budget allocated toward the creation of a minimum viable product
(MVP) by July 1, 2016, inclusive of its back end (2.1), front end (2.2), and associated
maintenance and sustainability costs (2.4) for this time period, is approximately $150,000. This
product will serve an estimated 500 participants per year, for a total of no more than 1500
participants by the end of the 3-year contract. OWD may consider additional features (2.3) and
maintenance and sustainability features (2.4) that exceed the $150,000 budget, based on your
specific proposal and the available funding.

We encourage you to submit a proposal responding to all four parts of the RFP. We welcome
partnerships between multiple firms-- i.e. one firm could build the back end while another
develops the front end. We will also accept proposals addressing only part of this project scope;
however, firms proposing only a partial solution must describe how they would be flexible
enough to work with a partner of our choosing.

Note also, that this RFP is soliciting bids for the RFP tech tool, which is distinct from design of
programmatic elements such as: defining types of incentives offered, financial education
offerings, program branding and messaging, and creation of alternative deposit options for
families. This tech tool may be a vehicle for the delivery of such programmatic elements, but its
development is distinct.


2.1/ Back End Minimum Viable Product
In order to achieve working front end capabilities, we know the back end will need to, at
minimum and by July 1, 2016:
     securely coordinate data from a number of sources, including a number of financial
       institutions (see Appendix B);
     be able to link to a minimum number of account types, including savings accounts,
       checking accounts, custodial accounts, and 529s (see 1.1);
     automate data transfer;
     automate execution of at least one type of savings incentive (see 2.3);
     trigger alerts to both the individual participant and OWD when deposit amounts reach a
       particular threshold (e.g., the $2000 mark);
     automate generation of program reports for OWD that show (a) frequency of program
       use, (b) total family deposit amounts, (c) total earned incentives, and (d) total savings
       (family deposits + earned incentives) for both individual families and in aggregate,
     automate download of raw data collected, and
     incorporate an adaptability to changes and innovations in the financial services and
       technology sectors, i.e. be constructed on a framework that leverages REST APIs.

CSA RFP                                                                                               7
2.2/ Front End Minimum Viable Product
The front end of the tech tool will be each family’s first experience with the CSA program--and
it will ideally remain their ‘command central’ as they continue to participate in the
program. We want to make it as easy as we can for participating families to interact with their
CSA account. This means the tool must be accessible, intuitive to use, easy to navigate, and
aesthetically pleasing. At minimum and by July 1, 2016, families must be able to:
     select and “activate” one of the two account options laid out in section 1.1:
             o (1) easily link an account of their choice (savings, checking, or 529) to the tech
                  tool (see 1.1), or
             o (2) create a new custodial account through our future partner financial
                  institution (see 1.1);
     view information, such as deposit amounts (into their own linked or their custodial
          accounts), seed dollars and incentives earned (from OWD’s program funds), total
          amount “saved” (total between deposits and earned program funds), and other
          program information;
     update contact information, communicate intended changes to their program status to
          OWD (e.g., ‘opt out’ of the program early on or leave the program mid-way), and
          download program status change forms;
     ask for help and provide feedback;
     access the tech tool via any web browser or mobile device; and
     access the tech tool in both English and Spanish.

These functions should be accessible for all families, including those who have limited computer
skills.

The tech tool must also provide an interface for OWD staff, so they can quickly and efficiently
serve participating families. At minimum and by July 1, 2016, OWD will need to:
     make quick and easy edits or updates to the content and design of the family interface,
     provide help and support to participating families,
     share program reminders and alerts with participating families,
     solicit feedback from families, and
     analyze participant data in ways that are compelling to funders and constituents.


2.3/ Potential Future System Requirements
While the minimum requirements described in (2.1) and (2.2) above must be tested and ready
to launch at program start in Fall 2016, we’re interested in scoping out a timeline for the
duration of the pilot period to experiment with the following additional features:
     Accessibility for families who read and write languages other than English and Spanish
       (including traditional and simplified Chinese, Haitian and Cape Verdean Creole,
       Vietnamese, and Portuguese), and users who have disabilities under ADA Title II (see
       WCAG2 and Section 508 for guidance) as soon as possible.
     Execution of multiple types of savings incentives, such as:



CSA RFP                                                                                             8
          o     1:1 match- for every $1 that a participating family deposits into their account,
                OWD matches that contribution with $1 of program funds
           o Steady Saver- participants who deposit on a pre-determined regular basis
                receive a fixed bonus (e.g., participants who make deposits once per month for
                six consecutive months receive an additional $100 of program funds from OWD)
           o Benchmark- participating children who achieve specific academic benchmarks
                will receive a fixed bonus (e.g., children who make perfect attendance for six
                weeks in a row receive an additional $100 of program funds from OWD),
      Ways for users with disabilities and ways for users with limited English or Spanish skills
       to also use the tool
      Ways for families to be able to set and track their own savings goals
      Ability for families to “link” more than one account to the CSA (e.g., savings and 529)
      Texts, emails, or alerts that are pushed to families based on specific demographics and
       milestones
      Ways to integrate delivery of financial education to participating families
      Ability for OWD to modify existing reporting mechanisms and/or create their own
       reporting fields
      Automatic data analysis that displays real-time analytics in easy-to-read ways
      Login capability for school leadership to view CSA participation by school
      Social media integration (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, email) for participants, OWD,
       and other partners to highlight achievements
      Integration with other City tools, such as Discover BPS


2.4/ Sustainability & Scalability
Terrific customer service requires a commitment to constant improvement. At minimum, we
will need:
     an ever-improving solution based on stakeholder feedback,
     training for OWD staff, and
     ongoing maintenance and support.




CSA RFP                                                                                         9
3/ The Technical Proposal
The “technical proposal” is every element of your response to this RFP, except for anything
having to do with price (the price proposal covers that section). For the technical proposal, we
are looking for you to include the following: provide an introduction (3.1); share your
background and qualifications (3.2); propose your approach to this project (3.3); describe your
ownership and IP preferences (3.4); and sign our standard contract forms (3.5). The final
element of your technical proposal is a presentation/demo which you may be asked to conduct
for OWD, the Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics, and the Department of Innovation and
Technology (3.6).

We’ve also added an optional section (3.7) for you to add those ideas that you wanted to
include - that you think would make a better technology product to serve our CSA program -
but that you did not think you could add in your proposal given the time and budget constraints

CSA RFP                                                                                           13
3.4/ Ownership & Intellectual Property
Our interest is to work with a partner to develop an exceptional product, a product that
continues to improve both beyond this contract. Considering this, there are several options that
OWD will consider with respect to the ownership of the code and intellectual property
developed under this contract:
   1. Work for Hire. In this option, OWD is the owner of the code and all intellectual property
       developed as part of this project. In this case, OWD will likely open source this project
       following its completion, under a license that would encourage others to use the code
       and the intellectual property.
   2. Not Work For Hire, but Perpetual, Unlimited Rights License for OWD to the Code &
       IP. In this option, the partner would be the owner of the code and all intellectual
       property developed as part of this project. OWD would receive a perpetual, unlimited
       rights license to the software in its final state at the completion of the contract as well
       as the code and the intellectual property.
       Unlimited rights means that OWD may use, disclose, reproduce, prepare derivative
       works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly the
       code, software, and all related IP, in any manner and for any purpose, and to have or
       permit others to do so, even for commercial purposes.
   3. Not Work For Hire, and Perpetual, Government Purpose License for OWD to the Code
       & IP. In this option, the partner would be the owner of the code and all intellectual
       property developed as part of this project. OWD would have a perpetual, Government
       Purpose License to the software and code in its final state at the completion of the
       contract. A Government Purpose License provides OWD and its affiliated entities the
       right to reproduce, use, and prepare derivative works for government purposes.
       Government purpose means any activity in which OWD or its affiliated entities is a
       party, including cooperative agreements with other government entities. Government
       purposes do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, or disclose software or
       code for private commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.
   4. Not Work For Hire, and Perpetual License for OWD to the Code & IP. In this option, the
       partner would be the owner of the code and all intellectual property developed as part
       of this project. OWD and its affiliated entities would have a perpetual license to use the
       software in its final state at the completion of the contract.

In your response, please specify which of these options you would prefer. You may also
propose an alternative if none of these approaches fit your needs. In all instances members of
the public will have a limited license to use the public facing component of the software for the
purpose of accessing and processing permitting information.


3.5/ Presentation/Demo
OWD is looking for a close partner on this project. To gauge alignment with OWD’s goals, you
may be invited in for an on-site session with OWD to present/demo your technical proposal and
answer questions OWD may have. Demos will be scheduled during:
    November 23-November 25

CSA RFP                                                                                        14
      November 30-December 2


3.6/ The Cutting Room Floor (Optional)
There may be efforts you would have liked to include in this proposal that were not covered but
did not think were feasible given time and budget constraints. We would like to know what
some of those were. This section is optional.




CSA RFP                                                                                     15
4/ The Price Proposal
OWD is looking for a technology partner(s) who will be contracted for the duration of the 3-
year Boston CSA pilot. The present budget allocated toward the creation of a minimum viable
product (MVP) by July 1, 2016, inclusive of its back end (2.1), front end (2.2), and associated
maintenance and sustainability costs (2.4) for this time period, is approximately $150,000. This
product will serve an estimated 500 participants per year, for a total of no more than 1500
participants by the end of the 3-year contract. OWD may consider additional features (2.3) that
exceed the $150,000 budget, based on your specific proposal and the available funding.

The price proposal asks for details concerning the components of the pricing that go into each
Vendor's overall proposal. There are two parts to the price proposal: the narrative (4.1) and a
line-item budget (4.2). Understanding the level of effort and cost for each deliverable helps
OWD to better understand the structure of the proposed work.

Vendors are reminded that the price proposal must be submitted as a separate pricing
document in a separate sealed envelope.


4.1/ Narrative
Please include a narrative describing the various costs associated with your project and how
your organization approaches pricing. While your narrative can take any format, it should
include a justification for the various costs described in the line-item budget (4.2).


4.2/ Line-Item Budget
We require detailed pricing information in order to be able to evaluate your proposal. Please
use the following grid, or something similar, to provide detailed pricing for the following project
parts. If more information is needed, please request those details during the Bidder’s
Conference Call (1.4) or submit your questions in writing (1.3). Responses to all relevant
questions will be made publicly available per Sections 1.3 and 1.4.

6/ Selection Criteria
The criteria we are using for judging the strength of the technical proposal are outlined below.
Each proposal will be evaluated consistent with M.G.L. c. 30B sec. 6.


6.1/ Minimum Evaluation Criteria
All proposals received by OWD will first be reviewed to determine whether the proposal meets
all minimum criteria identified in the RFP. Minimum criteria are found in the Checklist for
Submitting Proposal (5.1).

For a proposal to meet all minimum criteria, a Vendor must unconditionally be able to check
each item as ‘Completed’ for Sections A and B and ‘Yes’ for each item in Section C. Minimum
evaluation criteria reflect those standards or attributes that OWD considers essential to the
performance of the contract.


6.2/ Comparative Evaluation Criteria
Proposals that have met all minimum evaluation criteria will be evaluated according to the
comparative evaluation criteria that follow in this section. After reviewing, the evaluation team
will prepare written evaluations for each proposal. The evaluators will assign a rating of “highly
advantageous,” “advantageous,” or “not advantageous” to each criterion. The team will use the
comparative evaluation criteria to assist in their evaluation of each Vendor’s overall
qualifications. All comparative evaluation ratings will be determined by the evaluation team.

OWD reserves the right to invite Vendors for an in-person demo or an interview either by
phone or in person. OWD may choose to conduct reference checks and include information
obtained from the interview and reference checks in the evaluation.

NOTE: Vendors should not count on interviews and reference checks as an opportunity to
provide additional information not contained in the proposal. All information that Vendors wish
the selection team to consider during the evaluation process should be included in the originally
submitted proposal.

Price proposals will be evaluated separately from the technical proposals. The evaluation team
will not see the price proposals until after the technical evaluations are complete.

6.2.1/ Introduction & Executive Summary (3.1)
HIGHLY               Vendor offers a clear introduction to the applicant firm(s), including all
ADVANTAGEOUS         information requested in Section 3.1. Vendor demonstrates a clear
                     alignment between the Boston CSA Program goals and the firm’s portfolio

7/ Terms & Conditions
7.1/ Cancellation, Rejection, and Waiver
OWD is under no obligation to proceed with this RFP and may cancel the RFP at any time with
or without the substitution of another. OWD reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any
or all proposals, when OWD determines that rejection serves the best interests of OWD. OWD
may waive minor informalities in the proposal or allow the Vendor to correct them.


7.2/ Withdrawal or Modification of Proposal
OWD may allow a Vendor representative bearing proper authorization and identification to
sign for, receive and withdraw the Vendor's unopened proposal prior to the submission
deadline. A Vendor that seeks to correct or modify its proposal may do so by withdrawing the
initial submission and then submitting a modified proposal prior to the submission deadline.


7.3/ Proposal Validity Period
By submitting a proposal, the Vendor agrees that its proposal is valid for one hundred twenty
(120) days following the submission deadline unless extended by mutual agreement.


7.4/ Proposal Costs
Any and all costs incurred by a Vendor in preparing a proposal and throughout the RFP process
are ineligible for reimbursement by OWD.


7.5/ Taxes
OWD is a tax‐exempt organization. However, should any part of the Contract be subject to
taxes, unless otherwise specified in this RFP, the Vendor shall include and be responsible for
paying all taxes that are applicable.


7.6/ Subcontractors
OWD will contract with one Contractor who will be solely responsible for contractual
performance and who shall be the sole point of contact for OWD with regard to Contract
matters. In the event that the Contractor utilizes one or more Subcontractors, the Contractor
will assume all responsibility for performance of services by the Subcontractor(s).

OWD must be named as a third party beneficiary in all subcontracts. A list of all Subcontractors
proposed to take part in the performance of the Contract shall be provided to OWD for
approval prior to Contract execution.




CSA RFP                                                                                          27
7.7/ Use of City Name
The Contractor and any Subcontractor(s) agree not to use the City of Boston name or seal, or
that of any other City Agency or Department, or of the Boston Redevelopment Authority in
advertising, trade literature, or press releases without the prior approval of OWD.


7.8/ Rule of Award
The contract for the Boston Children’s Savings Accounts (CSA) Pilot Program Tech Tool will be
awarded to the most favorable proposal based on the selection criteria outlined in Section 6
above. The successful respondent will be deemed, in the opinion of the selection Committee, to
be the most responsive and acceptable proposal, taking into consideration the reliability of the
respondent, the qualities of the services proposed to be supplied, and their conformity with the
specifications required. Pricing will be a significant factor, but not the sole determinant in the
selection.

If a Contract is awarded, the Contract will be awarded to that responsive and responsible
Vendor whose proposal is deemed most advantageous to OWD taking into consideration the
evaluation criteria and proposal pricing. OWD will contract with the selected Vendor that best
meets OWD's needs and may not necessarily make an award to the lowest price bidder.

An award letter or award notification is not a communication of acceptance of a Vendor's
proposal. No final award has been made until final execution of a Contract by the Vendor and
OWD, and the approval of the final Contract by the EDIC Board, as well as Contractor receipt of
a City issued Purchase Order. Until such time, OWD may reject any or all proposals or elect not
to proceed with this RFP. The Vendor shall not furnish any services, equipment, materials, or
labor unless a fully executed and approved Contract and Purchase Order is received from OWD,
and funds are appropriated for the Contract.


7.9/ Contract
The selected firm will be required to sign EDIC’s Standard Contract upon contract award. In
addition to EDIC's Standard Contract and any applicable supplemental terms and conditions
that are part of this RFP, the Contract will include, without limitation, OWD required forms and
certifications, including OWD's CORI Compliance Certification, Living Wage Form, Wage Theft
Form, Contractor Certification, and Certificate of Authority. These forms are available upon
request. The submitted proposal, along with the RFP, will also be part of the Contract between
OWD and the Contractor.

The Contract is subject to the availability and appropriation of funds and may be cancelled by
OWD without penalty in any year in which an appropriation is not made.

attachments at the end of this RFP:

Appendix A/ Overview of Relevant City Departments & Key
Stakeholders
Because several stakeholders will come together to produce the CSA Pilot Program, all City
departments and key stakeholders--and a general sense of their roles and functions pertaining
to the CSA Pilot Program--are detailed in this appendix.

A.1/ Mayor’s Office of Financial Empowerment
The Mayor’s Office of Financial Empowerment (OFE) will act as the primary manager of the CSA
Pilot Program. OFE will be responsible for all programmatic duties related to the CSA Pilot
Program.

A.2/ Boston Public Schools
The Boston Public Schools (BPS) will serve as the initial point of contact for the CSA Pilot
Program. The CSA Pilot Program will be delivered to 3-5 BPS schools with Kindergarten
classrooms during the pilot phase; the full program will reach all Boston district and charter
school Kindergarten classrooms.

BPS will provide participating families with information about the CSA Pilot Program, and they
will serve as hosts for the delivery of some of the in-person financial education components.

A.3/ Eos Foundation
The Eos Foundation serves as one of the primary partners driving the CSA Pilot Program. Eos
and OFE are jointly designing the CSA Pilot Program to meet Boston’s specific needs. Eos is also
the primary funder of the CSA Pilot Program.

A.4/ Financial Institution
Families who choose to link their own bank accounts to the tech tool will likely bank at one of
many financial institutions in the Boston area. While we cannot foresee every financial
institution that our participants may want to link to, we would like to give them as many
options as possible.

The following are financial institutions (listed in alphabetical order) that have over five brick and
mortar branches in the City of Boston:
     Bank of America
     Citizen’s Bank
     East Boston Savings Bank
     Eastern Bank
     Santander Bank
     TD Bank
In addition, there are several credit unions in Boston that our participants may belong to,
and/or our participants may already have MA 529 accounts (serviced by Fidelity) or 529
accounts from other states.

A financial institution (TBD) will serve as the primary banking partner for the CSA Pilot
Program’s individual custodial accounts.

A.5/ Account Custodian
An account custodian (TBD) will serve as the named holder of the individual custodial accounts
for participants who choose that option.

*Tech solution must be agnostic to financial institution and account type--in other words, the
ideal tech solution would allow any financial institution (bank, credit union) and any account
type (savings, checking, 529) to be able to be linked so that families could easily join an existing
account to this program.

B.1/ Participant Deposits
Participant deposits into their accounts will likely clear on a nightly basis. Participants and OWD
will need to be able to see when deposits are made, amount of each deposit, and cumulative
total deposit amounts.

B.2/ Participant Withdrawals
Participant withdrawals from their accounts will likely clear on a nightly basis. Participants and
OWD will need to be able to see when withdrawals are made, and withdrawing participants will
need to be alerted to the repercussions of withdrawal prior to completing the withdrawal
transaction.

B.3/ Seed Money

Participants will begin with up to $100 of seed money earmarked for them in OWD’s/the City’s
“Master Account.” Participants and OWD will need to be able to see both the seed amount and
cumulative program fund amounts.

B.4/ Earned Incentives
Participants may “earn” incentives over the course of the program. These incentives are also
earmarked in OWD’s/the City’s “Master Account” under the participant’s name. Participants
and OWD will need to be able to see when incentives are earned, the amount of incentive
earned, and cumulative program fund amounts.

B.5/ Child Contact
Each child’s name and address must be input from BPS after K2 registration has completed and
a finalized list of children in each class is made. Additionally, children who join a class mid-year
should be able to be added to the program using this information from BPS.

B.6/ Child School & School ID Number
Each child’s ID number and present school must be input from BPS after K2 registration has
completed and a finalized list of children in each class is made. Additionally, children who join a
class mid-year should be able to be added to the program using this information from BPS.

B.7/ Child Attendance, Grades
Children’s attendance, grades, and other school data may be used as a means for earning
incentives in the future (see 2.3). These data would need to come from BPS to trigger
earmarking of program funds for specific children.

and collectively, as “Parties”.

        In consideration of the following mutual consents and undertakings herein set forth, each Party
agrees as follows:

I.      SCOPE OF SERVICES

        A.      Description of Services. The Consultant, by and through its staff and approved Sub-
consultants, shall be responsible for coordinating and completing the services set forth in Section 2
attached hereto and incorporated herein as a part hereof, on or before __________, 20__.
        B.       Changes to Scope of Services. EDIC’s Authorized Representative may at any time, by
written notice, make reasonable and non-substantial changes within the general scope of this Contract
in the tasks to be performed. If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the
time required for, the performance of any part of the services under this Contract, an equitable
adjustment shall be made in the compensation to be paid under this Contract and this Contract shall be
amended in writing accordingly, such change must be approved by EDIC’s Director. Any claim for
adjustment under this Section I.B. must be asserted within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by
the Consultant of the notification of change.
        C.      Performance Standards. The Consultant agrees that the services provided hereunder
shall conform to professional standards of care and practice customarily expected of like firms engaged
in performing comparable work, that the personnel furnishing said services shall be qualified and
competent to perform adequately the services assigned to them and that the recommendations,
guidance and performance of such personnel shall reflect such standard of professional knowledge and
judgment.
II.     COMPENSATION

        A.      Amount of Payment. Except as provided in Section VI.A of this Contract, the Consultant

                    phase after issuance of a Notice to Proceed from EDIC. This amount includes all
                    fees, overhead, general administrative costs, profit and applicable taxes or
                    governmental charges, if any, for all Consultant and/or Sub-consultants charges
                    arising under this Contract and all reimbursable expenses.
                2. For all services performed, either by the Consultant or by Sub-consultants, the
                   Consultant shall be paid not more than once a month upon EDIC’s approval of the

term of this Contract, the Consultant shall submit to EDIC a monthly statement detailing all Services
rendered and all reimbursable expenses incurred during the prior month. The Consultant’s monthly

                1.       On fourteen (14) days notice, without cause; or
                  2.     On seven (7) days notice if the services to be performed under this Contract
shall be canceled or abandoned by EDIC; or if the Contract or any part thereof shall be assigned without
the prior written consent of EDIC’s Director; or if the Consultant shall violate any of the provisions of this
Contract or fail to perform, keep or observe any of the terms, covenants or conditions herein contained;

or if the Consultant fails to perform services in a timely and workmanlike manner; provided, however,
that the Consultant shall not be in default if any such failure to perform or make progress arises out of
causes beyond its control and through no fault or negligence of its own. In the event of such
termination, EDIC may procure, upon such terms and in such manner as it shall deem appropriate,
services similar to those so terminated without prejudice to any other rights and remedies for default
EDIC may have.
        B.      Termination of Subconsultant Contracts. Consistent with the procedure set forth in

custody upon completion of the work or upon request in writing by EDIC’s Director, and in any event no
later than sixty (60) days after the termination of this Contract unless such time limit shall be extended
in writing by EDIC’s Director. Any plans or drawings are the property of EDIC, and shall be of the size

Representative and/or EDIC’s Director.
        B.      Authority’s Authorized Representative. Gerald Autler, Senior Project Manager/Planner

action, suits, losses, damages and expenses, including attorneys fees, to the extent arising out of or
resulting from any action by the Consultant and anyone employed by it, including Sub-consultants and
their employees, in the performance of this Contract. Such obligation shall not be constructed to negate
or abridge any other obligation of indemnification running to EDIC which would otherwise exist. EDIC
shall give the Consultant prompt and timely notice of any claim, threatened or made, or suit instituted
against it which could result in a claim for indemnification hereunder. The extent of the foregoing
indemnification and hold harmless provisions shall not be limited by any provision of insurance
contained in this Contract.

attached hereto and incorporated as a part hereof. The Consultant shall also complete and sign the
Certificate of Compliance with Laws set forth in Exhibit D attached hereto and incorporated as a part
hereof.
        G.      No Waiver. Any failure by EDIC to assert its rights for or upon any default of this
Contract shall not be deemed a waiver of such rights, nor shall any waiver be implied from the making of
any payment hereunder. EDIC’s review, approval, acceptance or payment for services under this
Contract shall not operate as a waiver of any rights under this Contract and the Consultant shall be and
remain liable to EDIC for all damages incurred by EDIC as a result of the Consultant’s failure to perform
in conformance with the terms and conditions of this Contract. The rights and remedies of EDIC

                                                                                                 Page | 4

event shall the total liability of EDIC in connection with this Contract exceed the Maximum Amount
provided for under Section II hereof. In no event shall EDIC be liable to the Consultant for damages for

held contractually liable by or to the Consultant under any term or provision of this Contract or because
of any breach thereof. No member or employee of the Consultant shall be charged personally or held
contractually liable by or to EDIC under any term or provision of this Contract or because of any breach
thereof, for any action performed within the Consultant’s scope of services and authority under this
Contract.
       K.       No Employment of Authority Personnel. During the term of this Contract, the
