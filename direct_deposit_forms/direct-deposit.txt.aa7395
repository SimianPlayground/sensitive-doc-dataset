To enroll in Full Service Direct Deposit, simply fill out this form and give it to your payroll manager. Attach a voided check
for each checking account – not a deposit slip. If depositing to a savings account, ask your bank to give you the
Routing/Transit Number for your account. It isn’t always the same as the number on a savings deposit slip. This will help
ensure that you are paid correctly.
Below is a sample check MICR line, detailing where the information necessary to complete this form can be found.
