This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as "Borrower" or "Co-Borrower,"
as applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when                                the income or assets of a person other than the Borrower
(including the Borrower's spouse) will be used as a basis for loan qualification or                       the income or assets of the Borrower's spouse or other person who has
community property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or
other person has community property rights pursuant to applicable law and Borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is located in a
community property state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

If this is an application for joint credit, Borrower and Co-Borrower each agree that we intend to apply for joint credit (sign below):

                      VERMONT RESIDENTIAL ENERGY CODE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
On May 7, 1997, the Vermont Legislature enacted the Vermont Residential Energy Code (officially called the
“Residential Building Energy Standards”). If you are building a new single family dwelling, two family dwelling, multi-
family dwelling three stories in height or less or building an addition to your existing home which is 500 square feet or
more, there are certain energy requirements that must be met. This is effective for all residential construction that was
begun on or after July 1, 1998.

Enclosed is a brochure on the Energy Code with general information. For more detailed information for builders, the
Vermont Department of Public Service and Energy Code Assistance Center have also published a 65 page “Vermont
Residential Energy Code Handbook” that specifies the requirements for complying with the Code.

CONTRACTOR-BUILT HOMES AND ADDITIONS                                                                                        .
Your builder or contractor is required to certify that your new home or addition is built to these standards.
Within 30 days of completion of construction, your builder must:
        1) Fill out a “VT Residential Building Energy Standards Certificate”;
        2) Post the Certificate in the home;
        3) Send a copy of the certificate to the Department of Public Service and file and index a copy in the town
            land records; and
        4) Provide a copy of the Certificate to be included in your file with this lending institution. (This is not required
            by law, but is a policy of this lender).

OWNER/BUILDER HOMES AND ADDITIONS                                                                                   .
The Energy Code statute allows for an “owner/builder” to build a home or addition that does not meet the standards.
To be considered an “owner/builder” the home must be used as a dwelling by the owner/builder and the owner/builder
must direct the details of construction.

As an owner/builder, if the home does not meet the Code, when you decide to sell, you must disclose, in writing, to a
prospective buyer, before entering into a binding purchase and sales agreement, the nature and extent of any non-
compliance with the standards. This written statement must itemize which measures do not meet the Code using the
“Vermont Owner/Builder Disclosure Statement”. This Statement must be filed with the Department of Public service
and filed and recorded in the town land records within 30 days following the sale by you, the owner. Your lender may
require a copy of this Statement at closing.

If an owner/builder home will meet the Code, a copy of the “VT Residential Building Energy Standards Certificate”
should be completed, posted in the home, filed with the Department of Public Service and filed and recorded in the
town land records within 30 days following the completion of construction. Your lender may require a copy of this
Certificate at closing.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT                                                                                                                                  .
I have read this statement and understand my obligations under the Energy Code as presented here and in the
accompanying materials.

This Disclosure Statement was produced by the Vermont Department of Public Service (DPS) and the DPS is
responsible for its contents. Any questions regarding this Disclosure Statement or the Energy Code should be directed
to the Energy Code Assistance Center (ECAC) at toll free 888-373-2255. The lender has provided this Disclosure
Statement for the information and use of the buyer. The lender is not responsible for any violation of the Energy Code,
for any action required by the Energy Code, or for assuring the buyer or any other party that the dwelling complies with
the Energy Code.

Caution. If the tax transcript is being mailed to a third party, ensure that you have filled in lines 6 through 9 before signing. Sign and date the form once
you have filled in these lines. Completing these steps helps to protect your privacy. Once the IRS discloses your tax transcript to the third party listed on
line 5, the IRS has no control over what the third party does with the information. If you would like to limit the third party's authority to disclose your
transcript information, you can specify this limitation in your written agreement with the third party.

              ADDENDUM TO RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOAN APPLICATION



Can anyone, other than you, claim a homestead interest* in the property that will secure
repayment of the loan?

                                 No                           Yes



If yes, who may be able to claim a homestead interest?

*Vermont law recognizes a homestead right in the spouse or civil union partner of the legal
owner of real estate, which is used or kept as their primary home, even if the spouse or civil
union partner is not a co-owner of that home. This homestead interest prevents creditors from
attaching the entire homestead property without the written consent of both spouses or partners.
Therefore, the lender will require that both spouses or civil union partners sign the mortgage
deed, or otherwise waive their homestead interest in the property, in order to insure that it is
fully enforceable.

This Addendum has been prepared in response to Act 91 of the 2000 Legislative Session,
effective July 1, 2000, which provides that parties to a civil union shall have all the same
benefits, protections, and responsibilities afforded under Vermont law to spouses in a marriage.

You should consult an attorney for specific legal advice regarding homestead rights and for
specific legal advice regarding benefits, protections, and responsibilities under Act 91.
