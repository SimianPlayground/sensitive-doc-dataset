                                     STATEMENTS REQUIRED BY LAWS AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS

To comply with legislation passed by the Congress and Executive Orders issued by the President, Federal executive agencies,
including the Small Business Administration (SBA), must notify you of certain information. You can find the regulations and policies
implementing these laws and Executive Orders in Title 13, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter 1, or our Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs). In order to provide the required notices, the following is a brief summary of the various laws and Executive Orders
that affect SBA's Disaster Loan Programs. A glossary of terms can be found at Disasterloan.SBA.GOV

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (5 U.S.C. 552)

This law provides, with some exceptions, that we must make records or portions of records contained in our files available to
persons requesting them. This generally includes aggregate statistical information on our disaster loan programs and other
information such as names of borrowers (and their officers, directors, stockholders or partners), loan amounts at maturity, the
collateral pledged, and the general purpose of loans. We do not routinely make available to third parties your proprietary data
without first notifying you, as required by Executive Order #12600, or information that would cause competitive harm or constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests must describe the specific records you want. For information about the FOIA, contact
the Chief, FOI/PA Office, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 5900, Washington, DC 20416, or by e-mail at foia@sba.gov.

PRIVACY ACT (5 U.S.C. § 552a)

Anyone can request to see or get copies of any personal information that we have in your file. Any personal information in your file
that is retrieved by individual identifiers, such as name or social security number is protected by the Privacy Act, which means
requests for information about you may be denied unless we have your written permission to release the information to the
requestor or unless the information is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The Agreements and
Certifications section of this form contains written permission for us to disclose the information resulting from this collection to
state, local or private disaster relief services.

The Privacy Act authorizes SBA to make certain "routine uses" of information protected by that Act. One such routine use for SBA's
loan system of records is that when this information indicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil, criminal, or
administrative in nature, SBA may refer it to the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local or foreign, charged with
responsibility for or otherwise involved in investigation, prosecution, enforcement or prevention of such violations. Another routine
use of personal information is to assist in obtaining credit bureau reports, on the Disaster Loan Applicants and guarantors for
purposes of originating, servicing, and liquidating Disaster loans. See, 69 F.R. 58598, 58617 (and as amended from time to time) for
additional background and other routine uses.

Under the provisions of the Privacy Act, you are not required to provide social security numbers. (But see the information under
Debt Collection Act below) We use social security numbers to distinguish between people with a similar or the same name for
credit decisions and for debt collection purposes. Failure to provide this number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to
which you are entitled by law, but having the number makes it easier for us to more accurately identify to whom adverse credit
information applies and to keep accurate loan records.

Note: Any person concerned with the collection, use and disclosure of information, under the Privacy Act may contact the Chief,
FOI/PA Office, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 5900, Washington, DC 20416 or by e-mail at foia@sba.gov
for information about the Agency's procedures relating to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act.

DEBT COLLECTION ACT OF 1982; DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT OF 1984; DEBT COLLECTION IMPROVEMENT
ACT OF 1996 & other titles (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.)

These laws require us to aggressively collect any delinquent loan payments and to require you to give your taxpayer
identification number to us when you apply for a loan. If you receive a loan and do not make payments when they become due,
we may take one or more of the following actions (this list may not be exhaustive):

               *Report the delinquency to credit reporting bureaus.
               *Offset your income tax refunds or other amounts due to you from the Federal Government.
               *Refer the account to a private collection agency or other agency operating a debt collection center.
               *Suspend or debar you from doing business with the Federal Government.
               *Refer your loan to the Department of Justice.
               *Foreclose on collateral or take other actions permitted in the loan instruments.
               *Garnish wages.
               *Sell the debt.
               *Litigate or foreclose.

RIGHT TO FINANCIAL PRIVACY ACT OF 1978 (12 U.S.C. § 3401 et seq.)

This notifies you, as required by the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (Act), of our right to access financial records
held by financial institutions that were or are doing business with you or your business. This includes financial institutions
participating in loans or loan guarantees.

The law provides that we may access your financial records when considering or administering Government loan or loan
guaranty assistance to you. We must give a financial institution a certificate of our compliance with the Act when we first
request access to your financial records. No other certification is required for later access. Our access rights continue for
the term of any approved loan or loan guaranty. We do not have to give you any additional notice of our access rights
during the term of the loan or loan guaranty.

We may transfer to another Government authority any financial records included in a loan application or about an
approved loan or loan guaranty as necessary to process, service, liquidate, or foreclose a loan or loan guaranty. We will
not permit any transfer of your financial records to another Government authority except as required or permitted by law.

CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION ACT (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)

This legislation gives an applicant who is refused credit because of adverse information about the applicant's credit,
reputation, character or mode of living an opportunity to refute or challenge the accuracy of such reports. Therefore, if we
decline your loan in whole or in part because of adverse information in a credit report, you will be given the name and
address of the reporting agency so you can seek to have that agency correct its report, if inaccurate. If we decline your
loan in whole or in part because of adverse information received from a source other than a credit reporting agency, you
will be given information but not the source of the report.

Within 3 days after the consummation of the transaction, any recipient of an SBA loan which is secured in whole or in part
by a lien on the recipient's residence or household contents may rescind such a loan in accordance with "Regulation Z" of
the Federal Reserve Board.
