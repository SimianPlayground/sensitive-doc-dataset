HOW TO USE THIS FORM
Dear Participant:
Usually, health care providers will bill us for services rendered to you and your enrolled dependents. This is the preferred procedure. You are not bothered with
claim forms and we often need more details than are ordinarily provided on bills to patients.
Sometimes, a physician may not bill us or an ambulance company. For example, they may send the bill directly to you. In either instance, we have no way of knowing
about your claim. This participant submitted claim form was developed to notify us of any covered health service for which we have not already been billed. Please
read the following instructions about how to submit your Health Care claims.
If the patient has received benefits from any other health coverage plan held by reason of law or employment, the explanation of benefits form furnished by the other
insurance company pertaining to these charges must be included with the claim. A clear photocopy of the other insurance company’s explanation of benefits form is
acceptable in place of the original document.
