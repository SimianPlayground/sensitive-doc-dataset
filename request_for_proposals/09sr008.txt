1 Introduction


Organizations that are in the process of developing a Request for Proposal (RFP) have often
looked to existing sources for ideas on how to phrase language to cover a specific topic. They are
often disappointed to learn that the search for RFP language examples is a time-consuming
exercise that involves searching across multiple publications that may or may not include the
topical information that they seek.

The Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Instituteâ„¢ (SEI) has initiated an effort to compile
publicly available recommendations for RFP content and examples of language for RFP Sections
C, M, and L. The sources are referenced in the text and fully listed at the end of this document.
This paper was developed in response to Task 2.2.2 of the FY09 Strategic Software Improvement
Plan (SSIMP), which is the implementation plan for the Army Strategic Software Improvement
Program (ASSIP). Task 2.2.2 seeks to â€•define and communicate the software engineering and
management events and deliverables necessary to be included in the Request for Proposal (RFP)
or the contract to support successful acquisition of software intensive systems.â€–1

Please note that we have elected to discuss the specifics of Section M before L since that is the
order in which the effort is needed. Evaluation factors are defined before one can complete the
Instructions to Offerors, so that Section L directly elicits information supporting Section M.

It should also be noted that the material is provided exactly as written in the original sources, and
there is no information in these sources regarding the effectiveness or appropriateness of the
language in a particular context. However, this information can serve as a starting point for
determining phrasing that will lead to desired results. These language suggestions should be
tailored for organizational needs and in accordance with the acquirersâ€™ legal authorities and
organizational policies and procedures.

We invite the community to provide additional examples of language and recommendations for
the sections covered by this document or for additional sections that it would be useful to add.

2 Overview of RFP Sections C, M, and L


The government solicits proposals from potential offerors through the issuance of a solicitation. In
negotiated procurements, this document is called a Request for Proposal (RFP). The RFP includes
information necessary for the offerors to understand what the government is buying, what
information they must provide, and how their proposals will be evaluated [Army 2008].

The success of an acquisition is directly linked to the quality of the RFP. A well-written RFP will

    facilitate a fair competition
    limit criteria to discriminators that add value
    clearly detail information required by the offerors
    clearly identify the evaluation and award criteria
    preserve the offerorsâ€™ flexibility to propose innovative solutions
    convey a clear understanding of the governmentâ€™s requirements
    specify areas where the offerors can make technical and cost tradeoffs in their proposals
    [Army 2008]

Our focus on Sections C, M, and L is based on the number of examples of publicly available
language that were available. Please note that we treat Section M before Section L because
understanding the evaluation factors precedes developing a list of required proposal information.

M            Evaluation factors for award

[FAR]
Section C is part of Part 1 â€“ The Schedule of the typical RFP. In our search for publicly available
language, we found that Section C provided publicly accessible and attributable language in
sufficient quantity to be included in this document. Section C (includes Description/Specification/
Statement of Objectives (SOO) or Statement of Work (SOW) and contains the description of the
products to be delivered or the work to be performed under the contract. This section typically
includes the governmentâ€™s SOO (or SOW) and preliminary system performance specification
[DOD 2006].

Sections L and M are in Part IVâ€”Representations and Instructions. Section M of the RFP states
the evaluation factors that are used for selecting the contractor. Section M should be carefully
structured to address only those elements determined to be discriminators in the source selection
to select the best proposal with acceptable program risk. The most effective Section M evaluation
factors are measurable, relevant to the program, traceable, with expected differentiation among
the offers, and under the offerorâ€™s control. Section M should not contain any evaluation factors or
subfactors for which there is not a corresponding request for proposal information in Section L. In
preparing Sections M and L, be aware of the proposal preparation time and page limitations. Ask
only for information that should be readily available to offerors and that is necessary to
accomplish the source selection evaluation [DOD 2006].

Section L of the RFP instructs the offerors on how to structure their proposal and what should be
included in each proposal section. It needs to clearly identify the structure and composition of
each volume and section of the proposal and should track to the evaluation factors in Section M
[DOD 2006].

The technical definition of the computer software architecture and data metamodel, estimated
sizing, throughput timing, and growth migration strategy also need to be defined as criteria in
Section L and in the offerorâ€™s proposal [SMC 2004].

The questions below help to develop the technical aspects of Section M and Section L [DOD
2006].

Example questions for developing specific software engineering-related criteria and
instructions for Sections M and L
1. How will the evaluation team establish an understanding of the offerorsâ€™ technical approach?
2. How can the evaluation team develop confidence that the offerorsâ€™ proposed technical design
   solutions will meet all technical requirements, including operational performance and
   logistics/sustainment requirements?
3. Is the technical approach implemented within performance, cost, and schedule requirements?


3 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
4. How will the evaluation team evaluate the system-of-systems (SOS) or family-of-systems
   (FOS) interfaces and integration issues on the program?
5. How will the evaluation team establish whether the specific plans for implementing and
   managing the technical (i.e., software engineering [SE]) and technical management processes
   are based on company enterprise processes? Is there objective evidence of the capability or
   maturity of these processes based on industry best practices? How will they be evaluated for
   consistency and compatibility with the governmentâ€™s technical and management processes (as
   defined in the Systems Engineering Plan [SEP])?
6. How will the evaluation team determine that the domain experience, past performance, and
   process maturity of the specific project team, company subgroup, teammates, and
   subcontractors proposed to execute the work directly related to the program being bid?
7. How will the evaluation team understand whether the proposed technical solution is
   adequately supported by studies, analyses, modeling and simulations, and demonstrations?
8. How will the evaluation team evaluate the fidelity and appropriateness of modeling and
   simulation proposed for the project, and how will it be validated?
9. How will the evaluation team determine whether the offeror's proposed information
   architecture (IA) approach solution meets Department of Defense (DoD) requirements? How
   will it do the same for any security or safety engineering requirements?
10. How will the evaluation team assess the maturity and application of the offerorâ€™s proposed
    processes in the proposal risk assessment?
11. How will the evaluation team determine that the risk management approach proposed is
    appropriate for the program being bid (for example, consistent and compatible with the
    governmentâ€™s risk management process)?
12. How will the evaluation team determine that technical cost and resources proposed for the
    program are reasonable and realistic for the planned program approach?
    How will the evaluation team establish that the offerorâ€™s proposed schedule is realistic and
    that the critical path(s) analysis is realistic [DOD 2006]?

NOTE: For our discussion in this reportâ€™s Section 3, Licensing Intellectual Property for
Government Use, we have included RFP Section I â€“ Contract Clauses. Because the acquisition of
rights to computer software and computer software documentation is a special interest in the
community, we have incorporated examples of Section I language that are relevant for acquiring
these rights. Contracting officers are well-versed on the clauses that should be included to address
specific issues, but acquiring organizations should have some knowledge regarding clause content
and applicability. These clauses consist of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Defense
Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and other local clauses, and are readily
available in those regulations. Section I incorporates the clauses by reference with the same force
and effect as if they were given in full text.

3 Licensing Intellectual Property for Government Use


This section of this report includes examples of contract clauses (Section I) that can be used in
RFPs to define the type(s) of â€•license to useâ€– that the government expects or requires when
acquiring software and software documentation. While contracting officers are responsible for
inserting contract clauses, data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible for
identifying the government's minimum needs. To do this, data managers and requirements
personnel must understand their options.

In addition to desired software performance, compatibility, or other technical considerations,
needs determinations should consider factors such as multiple-site or shared use requirements;
whether the governmentâ€™s software maintenance philosophy will require the right to modify or
have third parties modify the software; and any special computer software documentation
requirements. Due to the shared responsibility between data manager and contracting and the cost
associated with failures to understand options, the pertinent DFARS contract clauses are shown
here to increase the understanding of those who are participating in RFP development [DOD
2007].

asserting restrictions. For technical data, other than computer software documentation,
development refers to development of the item, component, or process to which the data pertain.
The Government's rights in computer software documentation generally may not be restricted. For
computer software, development refers to the software. Indicate whether development was
accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense. If development was not accomplished at
private expense, or for computer software documentation, enter the specific basis for asserting
restrictions.

***Enter asserted rights category (e.g., Government purpose license rights from a prior contract,
rights in SBIR data generated under another contract, limited, restricted, or Government purpose
rights under this or a prior contract, or specially negotiated licenses).

****Corporation, individual, or other person, as appropriate.

*****Enter â€•noneâ€– when all data or software will be submitted without restrictions.

     (4)     When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide sufficient
             information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's
             assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor's

             accordance with the procedures of the Validation of Asserted Restrictionsâ€”
             Computer Software clause of this contract.
(f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert
    restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display,

             thereof, of printed material containing computer software for which restrictions are
             asserted. Computer software transmitted directly from one computer or computer
             terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However,
             instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order
             to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior to or
             during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay,
             shall not be inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations
             that simulate combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's written permission
             to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions of
             computer software or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, shall also
             reproduce the asserted restrictions.

                                          SPECIAL LICENSE RIGHTS

                   The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform,

                   contract number)____, License No. ____(Insert license identifier)____.
                   Any reproduction of computer software, computer software
                   documentation, or portions thereof marked with this legend must also

                                                  (End of legend)
           (ii)       For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include Government purpose
                      license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (b)(5) of this
                      clause).
     (5)          Pre-existing markings. If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the
                  Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, release, perform,
                  display, or disclose computer software or computer software documentation and
                  those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such software or
                  documentation with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the software
                  qualified under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph
                  (f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.
(g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor
    and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver computer software or computer software
    documentation with other than Unlimited rights, shallâ€”
     (1)          Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive
                  markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and
     (2)          Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on
                  computer software or computer software documentation delivered under this
                  contract.
(h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings.
     (1)          Unjustified computer software or computer software documentation markings. The
                  rights and obligations of the parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings
                  on computer software or computer software documentation furnished or to be
                  furnished under this contract are contained in the Validation of Asserted
                  Restrictionsâ€”Computer Software and the Validation of Restrictive Markings on
                  Technical Data clauses of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision
                  of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore
                  or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the
                  procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.
     (2)          Nonconforming computer software or computer software documentation markings. A
                  nonconforming marking is a marking placed on computer software or computer
                  software documentation delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under
                  this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of
                  nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Asserted Restrictionsâ€”

                   Computer Software or the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data
                   clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a
                   nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct
                   such markings within sixty (60) days, the Government may ignore or, at the
                   Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.

    under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right
    otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.
(j) Limitation on charges for rights in computer software or computer software documentation.
     (1)           The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to

            (i)        The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the
                       software or documentation; or
           (ii)        The software or documentation is available to the public without restrictions.
     (2)           The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clauseâ€”
           (iii)       Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs
                       incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier
                       computer software or computer software documentation, if the subcontractor or
                       supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or
                       under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and
           (iv)        Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the
                       documents or other media in which the software or documentation will be
                       delivered.
(k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers.
     (3)           Whenever any noncommercial computer software or computer software
                   documentation is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the
                   Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in its
                   subcontracts or other contractual instruments, and require its subcontractors or
                   suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. No other clause
                   shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher
                   tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's computer
                   software or computer software documentation.
     (4)           The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power
                   to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in computer software or
                   computer software documentation from their subcontractors or suppliers.
     (5)           The Contractor shall ensure that subcontractor or supplier rights are recognized and
                   protected in the identification, assertion, and delivery processes required by
                   paragraph (e) of this clause.
     (6)           In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect
                   subcontractor or supplier rights in computer software or computer software
                   documentation as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the
                   Government.

27 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
            (i)        (Applicable to technical data other than computer software documentation.) An
                       item, component, or process, exists and is workable. Thus, the item or
                       component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is
                       generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed
                       or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the
                       applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended.
                       Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish
                       workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the
                       state of the art. To be considered â€•developed,â€– the item, component, or process
                       need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the
                       commercial market, nor must the item, component or process be actually
                       reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code;
           (ii)        A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer and tested to
                       the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that
                       the program can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose;
           (iii)       Computer software, other than computer programs, has been tested or analyzed
                       to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art
                       that the software can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose;
                       or
           (iv)        Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract has
                       been written, in any medium, in sufficient detail to comply with requirements
                       under that contract.
     (8)           â€•Developed exclusively at private expenseâ€– means development was accomplished
                   entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a
                   Government contract, or any combination thereof.
            (i)        Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.
           (ii)        Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-
                       price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary
                       to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether
                       development was at Government , private, or mixed expense.
     (9)           â€•Developed exclusively with Government fundsâ€– means development was not
                   accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.
    (10)           â€•Developed with mixed fundingâ€– means development was accomplished partially
                   with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a Government
                   contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a Government contract.
    (11)           â€•Form, fit, and function dataâ€– means technical data that describe the required
                   overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the
                   qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the
                   extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally
                   interchangeable items.
    (12)           â€•Generatedâ€– means technical data or computer software first created in the
                   performance of this contract.
    (13)           â€•Government purposeâ€– means any activity in which the United States Government is
                   a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national
                   defense organizations or sales or transfers by the United States Government to
                   foreign Governments or international organizations. Government purposes include

                   competitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce,
                   release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software for
                   commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.
    (14)           â€•License to use computer softwareâ€– means the rights to use, modify, reproduce,
                   release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the
                   Government. The Government may not, without the written permission of the party
                   asserting License to use computer software, release or disclose the technical data
                   outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or permit the
                   technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may
                   reproduce, release or disclose such data or permit the use or reproduction of the
                   data by persons outside the Government if reproduction, release, disclosure, or use
                   isâ€”
            (i)        Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or
           (ii)        A release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed manufacturing or
                       process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign Government that is in the
                       interest of the Government and is required for evaluation or informational
                       purposes;
           (iii)       Subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release, disclosure, or use
                       of the technical data; and
           (iv)        The Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such
                       reproduction, release, disclosure, or use.
    (15)           â€•Minor modificationâ€– means a modification that does not significantly alter the non-
                   Governmental function or purpose of computer software or is of the type customarily

     (4)     When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide sufficient
             information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's
             assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor's
             assertions to the Attachment and validate any listed assertions, at a later date, in
             accordance with the procedures of the Validation of Asserted Restrictionsâ€”
             Computer Software and/or Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data
             clauses of this contract.
(f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert
    restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display,
    or disclose technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract by
    marking the deliverable data or software subject to restriction. Except as provided in
    paragraph (f)(6) of this clause, only the following markings are authorized under this
    contract: the License to use computer software legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the
    restricted rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause, the SBIR data rights legend at
    paragraph (f)(4) of this clause, or the special license rights legend at paragraph (f)(5) of this
    clause; and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.
     (1)     General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers,
             shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend to all technical data
             and computer software that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall
             be placed on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material,
             each page of the printed material containing technical data or computer software for
             which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a page of printed material are
             subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling,
             underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier. Technical data or
             computer software transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to
             another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However, instructions that
             interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a
             restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use
             of the computer software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, shall not be
             inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations that simulate
             combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to deliver
             such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions of technical data,
             computer software, or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also
             reproduce the asserted restrictions.

                      from a specifically negotiated license shall be marked with the following legend:


                                                SPECIAL LICENSE RIGHTS
                            The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform,
                            display, or disclose this technical data or computer software are restricted

                  Markings on Technical Data and the Validation of Asserted Restrictionsâ€”Computer
                  Software clauses of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of this
                  contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at
                  the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the
                  applicable procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be
                  unjustified.
     (2)          Nonconforming markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on
                  technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the

                  Markings on Technical Data or the Validation of Asserted Restrictionsâ€”Computer
                  Software clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of
                  a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct
                  such markings within sixty (60) days, the Government may ignore or, at the
                  Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.
(i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government
    under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right
    otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.
(j) Limitation on charges for rights in technical data or computer software.
     (1)          The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited
                  to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data or computer
                  software to be delivered under this contract whenâ€”
           (i)        The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the

     (2)          The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clauseâ€”
           (i)        Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs
                      incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier
                      technical data or computer software, if the subcontractor or supplier has been
                      paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license
                      conveying the rights to the Government; and
           (ii)       Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the
                      documents or other media in which the technical data or computer software will
                      be delivered.


37 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
(k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers.
     (1)     The Contractor shall assure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers
             under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, and delivery
             processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized and protected.
     (2)     Whenever any noncommercial technical data or computer software is to be obtained
             from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract,
             the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual
             instrument, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration,
             except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall use the Technical Dataâ€”
             Commercial Items clause of this contract to obtain technical data pertaining to
             commercial items, components, or processes. No other clause shall be used to
             enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier
             subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data
             or computer software.
     (3)     Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall
             normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
             However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which
             may be submitted with other than Unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier,
             then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such
             technical data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier
             contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
     (4)     The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power
             to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or
             computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.
     (5)     In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect
             subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse
             for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.
                                             (End of clause)
                                          Alternate I (Jun 1995)
     As prescribed in 227.7104(d), add the following paragraph (l) to the basic clause:
(l) Publication for sale.
     (1)     This paragraph applies only to technical data or computer software delivered to the
             Government with SBIR data rights.
     (2)     Upon expiration of the SBIR data rights period, the Government will not exercise its
             right to publish or authorize others to publish an item of technical data or computer
             software identified in this contract as being subject to paragraph (l) of this clause if
             the Contractor, prior to the expiration of the SBIR data rights period, or within two
             years following delivery of the data or software item, or within twenty-four months
             following the removal of any national security or export control restrictions,
             whichever is later, publishes such data or software item(s) and promptly notifies the
             Contracting Officer of such publication(s). Any such publication(s) shall include a
             notice identifying the number of this contract and the Government's rights in the
             published data.
     (3)     This limitation on the Government's right to publish for sale shall continue as long as
             the technical data or computer software are reasonably available to the public for
             purchase.

EXAMPLE 1

[DFARS 252.227-7019]

     As prescribed in 227.7104(e)(3) or 227.7203-6(c), use the following clause:
                            Validation Of Asserted Restrictionsâ€”Computer Software
                                                   (Jun 1995)
(a) Definitions.
     (1)         As used in this clause, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the term â€•Contractorâ€–
                 means the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers.
     (2)         Other terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in Noncommercial
                 Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause
                 of this contract.
(b) Justification. The Contractor shall maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any
    markings that assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce,
    perform, display, release, or disclose computer software delivered or required to be delivered
    under this contract and shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a written
    justification for such restrictive markings in response to a request for information under
    paragraph (d) or a challenge under paragraph (f) of this clause.
(c) Direct contact with subcontractors or suppliers. The Contractor agrees that the Contracting
    Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors or suppliers at
    any tier who assert restrictions on the Government's right to use, modify, reproduce, release,
    perform, display, or disclose computer software. Neither this clause, nor any action taken by
    the Government under this clause, creates or implies privity of contract between the
    Government and the Contractor's subcontractors or suppliers.
(d) Requests for information.
     (1)         The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to provide sufficient information
                 to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's asserted restrictions.
                 Such information shall be based upon the records required by this clause or other
                 information reasonably available to the Contractor.
     (2)         Based upon the information provided, if theâ€”
           (i)       Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the Contracting
                     Officer mayâ€”
                      (A)     Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor's expense; or
                      (B)     Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at the
                              Contractor's expense. If the Contractor fails to correct or strike the
                              unjustified restriction and return the corrected software to the
                              Contracting Officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the



45 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
                                software, the Contracting Officer may correct or strike the markings at
                                that Contractor's expense.
           (ii)        Contracting Officer concludes that the asserted restriction is appropriate for this
                       contract, the Contracting Officer shall so notify the Contractor in writing.
     (3)           The Contractor's failure to provide a timely response to a Contracting Officer's
                   request for information or failure to provide sufficient information to enable the
                   Contracting Officer to evaluate an asserted restriction shall constitute reasonable
                   grounds for questioning the validity of an asserted restriction.
(e) Government right to challenge and validate asserted restrictions.
     (1)           The Government, when there are reasonable grounds to do so, has the right to
                   review and challenge the validity of any restrictions asserted by the Contractor on
                   the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or
                   disclose computer software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or
                   otherwise provided to the Government in the performance of this contract. Except for
                   software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without
                   restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions, the
                   Government may exercise this right only within three years after the date(s) the
                   software is delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government, or three years
                   following final payment under this contract, whichever is later.
     (2)           The absence of a challenge to an asserted restriction shall not constitute validation
                   under this clause. Only a Contracting Officer's final decision or actions of an agency
                   Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction that sustain the
                   validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.
(f) Challenge procedures.
     (1)           A challenge must be in writing and shallâ€”
            (i)        State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;
           (ii)        Require the Contractor to respond within sixty (60) days;
           (iii)       Require the Contractor to provide justification for the assertion based upon
                       records kept in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause and such other
                       documentation that are reasonably available to the Contractor, in sufficient
                       detail to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the validity of the asserted
                       restrictions; and
           (iv)        State that a Contracting Officer's final decision, during the three-year period
                       preceding this challenge, or action of a court of competent jurisdiction or Board
                       of Contract Appeals that sustained the validity of an identical assertion made by
                       the Contractor (or a licensee) shall serve as justification for the asserted
                       restriction.
     (2)           The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response if the Contractor submits
                   a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
     (3)           The Contracting Officer may request additional supporting documentation if, in the
                   Contracting Officerâ€˜s opinion, the Contractor's explanation does not provide
                   sufficient evidence to justify the validity of the asserted restrictions. The Contractor
                   agrees to promptly respond to the Contracting Officer's request for additional
                   supporting documentation.



46 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     (4)           Notwithstanding challenge by the Contracting Officer, the parties may agree on the
                   disposition of an asserted restriction at any time prior to a Contracting Officer's
                   final decision or, if the Contractor has appealed that decision, filed suit, or provided
                   notice of an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of competent
                   jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals.
     (5)           If the Contractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's request for information
                   or additional information under paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, the Contracting
                   Officer shall issue a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this
                   contract, pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.
     (6)           If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written explanation furnished pursuant
                   to paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to
                   the validity of an asserted restriction, determines that the asserted restriction hasâ€”
            (i)        Not been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a final decision,
                       in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, denying the validity of
                       the asserted restriction; or
           (ii)        Been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in
                       accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, validating the asserted
                       restriction.
     (7)           A Contractor receiving challenges to the same asserted restriction(s) from more than
                   one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the other challenges.
                   The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time
                   unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer who initiated the first in time
                   unanswered challenge, after consultation with the other Contracting Officers who
                   have challenged the restrictions and the Contractor, shall formulate and distribute a
                   schedule that provides the Contractor a reasonable opportunity for responding to
                   each challenge.
(g) Contractor appeal - Government obligation.
     (1)           The Government agrees that, notwithstanding a Contracting Officer's final decision
                   denying the validity of an asserted restriction and except as provided in paragraph
                   (g)(3) of this clause, it will honor the asserted restrictionâ€”
            (i)        For a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the Contracting Officer's final
                       decision to allow the Contractor to appeal to the appropriate Board of Contract
                       Appeals or to file suit in an appropriate court;
           (ii)        For a period of one year from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision
                       if, within the first ninety (90) days following the Contracting Officer's final
                       decision, the Contractor has provided notice of an intent to file suit in an
                       appropriate court; or
           (iii)       Until final disposition by the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or court of
                       competent jurisdiction, if the Contractor has:
                        (A)     appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals or filed suit an appropriate
                                court within ninety (90) days; or
                        (B)     submitted, within ninety (90) days, a notice of intent to file suit in an
                                appropriate court and filed suit within one year.
     (2)           The Contractor agrees that the Government may strike, correct, or ignore the
                   restrictive markings if the Contractor fails toâ€”


47 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
            (i)        Appeal to a Board of Contract Appeals within ninety (90) days from the date of
                       the Contracting Officer's final decision;
           (ii)        File suit in an appropriate court within ninety (90) days from such date; or
           (iii)       File suit within one year after the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision
                       if the Contractor had provided notice of intent to file suit within ninety (90) days
                       following the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision.
     (3)           The agency head, on a nondelegable basis, may determine that urgent or compelling
                   circumstances do not permit awaiting the filing of suit in an appropriate court, or the
                   rendering of a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract
                   Appeals. In that event, the agency head shall notify the Contractor of the urgent or
                   compelling circumstances. Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this clause, the
                   Contractor agrees that the agency may use, modify, reproduce, release, perform,
                   display, or disclose computer software marked with (i) Government purpose legends
                   for any purpose, and authorize others to do so; or (ii) restricted or special license
                   rights for Government purposes only. The Government agrees not to release or
                   disclose such software unless, prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is
                   subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of DFARS, or is a
                   Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a
                   Government contract that contains the clause at DFARS 252.227-7025, Limitations
                   on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with
                   Restrictive Legends. The agency head's determination may be made at any time after
                   the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision and shall not affect the
                   Contractor's right to damages against the United States, or other relief provided by
                   law, if its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld.
(h) Final disposition of appeal or suit. If the Contractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final
    disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is:
     (1)           Sustainedâ€”
            (i)        Any restrictive marking on such computer software shall be struck or corrected
                       at the Contractor's expense or ignored; and
           (ii)        If the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the Contractor
                       shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of
                       reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in
                       28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in challenging the
                       restriction, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.
     (2)           Not sustainedâ€”
            (i)        The Government shall be bound by the asserted restriction; and
           (ii)        If the challenge by the Government is found not to have been made in good faith,
                       the Government shall be liable to the Contractor for payment of fees and other
                       expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor in
                       defending the restriction.
(i) Flowdown. The Contractor shall insert this clause in all contracts, purchase orders, and
    other similar instruments with its subcontractors or suppliers, at any tier, who will be
    furnishing computer software to the Government in the performance of this contract. The
    clause may not be altered other than to identify the appropriate parties.

3.13 Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data

3.13.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

3.13.2 Section I - Contract Clauses

EXAMPLE 1

[DFARS 252.227-7037]

     As prescribed in 227.7102-3(c), 227.7103-6(e)(3), 227.7104(e)(5), or 227.7203-6(f), use the
     following clause:
     VALIDATION OF RESTRICTIVE MARKINGS ON TECHNICAL DATA (1999)
(a) Definitions. The terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in Technical Dataâ€”
    Noncommercial Items clause of this contract.
(b) Contracts for commercial itemsâ€”presumption of development at private expense. Under a
    contract for a commercial item, component, or process, the Department of Defense shall
    presume that a Contractorâ€˜s asserted use or release restrictions are justified on the basis that
    the item, component, or process was developed exclusively at private expense. The
    Department shall not challenge such assertions unless information the Department provides
    demonstrates that the item, component, or process was not developed exclusively at private
    expense.
(c) Justification. The Contractor or subcontractor at any tier is responsible for maintaining
    records sufficient to justify the validity of its markings that impose restrictions on the
    Government and others to use, duplicate, or disclose technical data delivered or required to
    be delivered under the contract or subcontract. Except under contracts for commercial items,
    the Contractor or subcontractor shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a
    written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a challenge under paragraph
    (e) of this clause.
(d) Pre-challenge request for information.
     (1)     The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish a
             written explanation for any restriction asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor
             on the right of the United States or others to use technical data. If, upon review of the
             explanation submitted, the Contracting Officer remains unable to ascertain the basis
             of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer may further request the
             Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the records of, or
             otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available to, the Contractor or
             subcontractor to justify the validity of any restrictive marking on technical data
             delivered or to be delivered under the contract or subcontract (e.g., a statement of
             facts accompanied with supporting documentation). The Contractor or subcontractor
             shall submit such written data as requested by the Contracting Officer within the
             time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed.
     (2)     If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written data furnished pursuant to
             paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the
             validity of a restrictive marking, determines that reasonable grounds exist to
             question the current validity of the marking and that continued adherence to the
             marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the

50 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
                   item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting
                   Officer shall follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of this clause.
     (3)           If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's
                   request for information under paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, and the Contracting
                   Officer determines that continued adherence to the marking would make
                   impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or
                   process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer may challenge
                   the validity of the marking as described in paragraph (e) of this clause.
(e) Challenge.
     (1)           Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and
                   acceptance, if the Contracting Officer determines that a challenge to the restrictive
                   marking is warranted, the Contracting Officer shall send a written challenge notice
                   to the Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restrictive markings. Such challenge
                   shallâ€”
            (i)        State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;
           (ii)        Require a response within sixty (60) days justifying and providing sufficient
                       evidence as to the current validity of the asserted restriction;
           (iii)       State that a DoD Contracting Officer's final decision, issued pursuant to
                       paragraph (g) of this clause, sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking
                       identical to the asserted restriction, within the three-year period preceding the
                       challenge, shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction if the validated
                       restriction was asserted by the same Contractor or subcontractor (or any
                       licensee of such Contractor or subcontractor) to which such notice is being
                       provided; and
           (iv)        State that failure to respond to the challenge notice may result in issuance of a
                       final decision pursuant to paragraph (f) of this clause.
     (2)           The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response as appropriate if the
                   Contractor or subcontractor submits a written request showing the need for
                   additional time to prepare a response.
     (3)           The Contractor's or subcontractor's written response shall be considered a claim
                   within the meaning of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601, et seq.), and
                   shall be certified in the form prescribed at 33.207 of the Federal Acquisition
                   Regulation, regardless of dollar amount.
     (4)           A Contractor or subcontractor receiving challenges to the same restrictive markings
                   from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the
                   existence of more than one challenge. The notice shall also state which Contracting
                   Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer
                   initiating the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the
                   Contractor or subcontractor and the other Contracting Officers, shall formulate and
                   distribute a schedule for responding to each of the challenge notices to all interested
                   parties. The schedule shall afford the Contractor or subcontractor an opportunity to
                   respond to each challenge notice. All parties will be bound by this schedule.
(f) Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond. Upon a failure of a
    Contractor or subcontractor to submit any response to the challenge notice, other than a
    failure to respond under a contract for commercial items, the Contracting Officer will issue a
    final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the Disputes clause of

51 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
    this contract pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction. This final decision shall be
    issued as soon as possible after the expiration of the time period of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) or
    (e)(2) of this clause. Following issuance of the final decision, the Contracting Officer will
    comply with the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this clause.
(g) Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor responds.
     (1)            If the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor or subcontractor has
                   justified the validity of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer shall issue a
                   final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor sustaining the validity of the
                   restrictive marking, and stating that the Government will continue to be bound by the
                   restrictive marking. This final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after
                   receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or
                   within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or
                   subcontractor that the Government will require. The notification of a longer period
                   for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the
                   response to the challenge notice.
     (2)
            (i)        If the Contracting Officer determines that the validity of the restrictive marking
                       is not justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision to the
                       Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the Disputes clause of this
                       contract. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of the Disputes clause, the final
                       decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or
                       subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period
                       that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor of the
                       longer period that the Government will require. The notification of a longer
                       period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after
                       receipt of the response to the challenge notice.
           (ii)        The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive
                       marking for a period of ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Contracting
                       Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Contractor
                       or subcontractor agrees that, if it intends to file suit in the United States Claims
                       Court it will provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer
                       within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final
                       decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. If the Contractor or
                       subcontractor fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit to
                       the Contracting Officer within the ninety (90)-day period, the Government may
                       cancel or ignore the restrictive markings, and the failure of the Contractor or
                       subcontractor to take the required action constitutes agreement with such
                       Government action.
           (iii)       The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive
                       marking where a notice of intent to file suit in the United States Claims Court is
                       provided to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of
                       the final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Government will
                       no longer be bound, and the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the
                       Government may strike or ignore the restrictive markings, if the Contractor or
                       subcontractor fails to file its suit within one (1) year after issuance of the final
                       decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency
                       determines, on a nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling circumstances
                       will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the United States Claims Court,

52 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
                      the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may, following notice to
                      the Contractor or subcontractor, authorize release or disclosure of the technical
                      data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the
                      final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to
                      damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately
                      upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.
           (iv)       The Government agrees that it will be bound by the restrictive marking where an
                      appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act until final
                      disposition by an agency Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims
                      Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines,
                      on a nondelegable basis, following notice to the Contractor that urgent or
                      compelling circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of
                      Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or
                      subcontractor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure of the
                      technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after
                      issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or
                      subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive
                      markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be
                      provided by law.
(h) Final disposition of appeal or suit.
     (1)          If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition
                  of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is sustainedâ€”
            (i)       The restrictive marking on the technical data shall be cancelled, corrected or
                      ignored; and
           (ii)       If the restrictive marking is found not to be substantially justified, the Contractor
                      or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be liable to the Government for payment
                      of the cost to the Government of reviewing the restrictive marking and the fees
                      and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the
                      Government in challenging the marking, unless special circumstances would
                      make such payment unjust.
     (2)          If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition
                  of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is not sustainedâ€”
            (i)       The Government shall continue to be bound by the restrictive marking; and
           (ii)       The Government shall be liable to the Contractor or subcontractor for payment
                      of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by
                      the Contractor or subcontractor in defending the marking, if the challenge by the
                      Government is found not to have been made in good faith.
(i) Duration of right to challenge. The Government may review the validity of any restriction on
    technical data, delivered or to be delivered under a contract, asserted by the Contractor or
    subcontractor. During the period within three (3) years of final payment on a contract or
    within three (3) years of delivery of the technical data to the Government, whichever is later,
    the Contracting Officer may review and make a written determination to challenge the
    restriction. The Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, disclosure
    or use of technical data at any time if such technical dataâ€”
     (1)          Is publicly available;
     (2)          Has been furnished to the United States without restriction; or

53 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     (3)     Has been otherwise made available without restriction. Only the Contracting
             Officer's final decision resolving a formal challenge by sustaining the validity of a
             restrictive marking constitutes â€•validationâ€– as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 2321.
(j) Decision not to challenge. A decision by the Government, or a determination by the
    Contracting Officer, to not challenge the restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not
    constitute â€•validation.â€–
(k) Privity of contract. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may
    transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors at any tier that assert
    restrictive markings. However, this clause neither creates nor implies privity of contract
    between the Government and subcontractors.
(l) Flowdown. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees to insert this clause in contractual
    instruments with its subcontractors or suppliers at any tier requiring the delivery of technical
    data, except contractual instruments for commercial items or commercial components.
                                             (End of clause)

                               GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

4.4      Defect Prevention

4.4.1     Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
      The Governmentâ€˜s objective is for the supplier to define and mitigate the manufacturing
      process risks associated with the design solution through the development of producible
      designs, capable fabrication and assembly processes, and associated controls. This includes
      activities such as the following [DOD 1998]:
        (1)   Developing and implementing an approach for the identification of key product
              characteristics. Key product characteristics are the features of a material or part
              whose variation has a significant influence on product fit, performance, service life,
              or manufacturability [DOD 1998].
        (2)   Identifying manufacturing process risks (e.g., the risks related to developing stable
              and capable processes, to minimizing the need for engineering changes, to
              preventing defects) associated with the evolving design solution, and developing and
              implementing appropriate design alternatives and risk reduction efforts [DOD 1998].

4.4.2     Section M - Evaluation

EXAMPLE 1
      Proposed approaches will be evaluated based upon [DOD 1998]:
        (1)   The extent to which they employ disciplined, structured processes (versus ad hoc or
              anecdotal) to identify and mitigate manufacturing process risks (e.g., the risks
              related to developing stable and capable processes, to minimizing the need for
              engineering changes, to preventing defects) [DOD 1998].
        (2)   The extent to which the processes for identifying key product characteristics and
              identifying/mitigating of manufacturing process risks are integrated with the overall
              systems engineering process [DOD 1998].
        (3)   The extent to which the proposed approaches reflect the integration of
              manufacturing process risk reduction efforts into the planning for this program
              [DOD 1998].

4.4.3     Section L - Instructions to Offerors

EXAMPLE 1
      Propose and discuss any defect prevention practices to be employed for this acquisition. To
      facilitate Government evaluation methods, provide rationale for each such method,
      indicating how it helps to meet the SOO paragraphs on defect prevention [DOD 1998].
      Describe how key product characteristics will be identified and how existing manufacturing
      process capabilities are considered in the assessment of manufacturing process risks
      associated with the evolving product design. Define how manufacturing process risk
      assessments are fed back to product design efforts to ensure that reducibility considerations
      are included in the evolving product design [DOD 1998].

4.5        Measures

4.5.1       Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
      The System Development Plan (Software Development Plan (SDP)) shall specify the
      collection of the following minimum set of metrics, and the collection methodology
      [Army 2006].
      a. Requirements volatility: total number of requirements at SSR and requirement changes
         over time after SSR.
      b. Software size: planned and actual number of units, lines of code, or other size
         measurement over time.
      c.    Software staffing: planned and actual staffing levels over time.
      d. Software progress: planned and actual number of software units designed, implemented,
         unit tested, and integrated over time.
      e.    Problem/change reports status: total number, number closed, number opened in the
            current reporting period, number by each software unit, age, and priority of open
            reports.
      f.    Computer hardware resource utilization: planned and actual use of computer hardware
            resources (e.g., processor capacity, memory capacity, input/output device capacity,
            communications/network equipment capacity, auxiliary storage device capacity, and bus
            bandwidth) over time and for the worst case operations scenario.
      g. Milestone performance: planned and actual dates of software development activities and
         events (detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) rate chart).

EXAMPLE 2
      It is imperative that the operational Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM)
      metrics associated with the system are translated into contractual terms that become system
      RAM requirements within the RFP and contract. For acquisition of an overall weapons
      system, an overall RAM requirement including Integrated Diagnostics should be imposed in
      the contract and demonstrated [DOD 2005].

EXAMPLE 3
      The contractor shall systematically collect and report actual contract costs to provide DoD
      cost analysts with needed data to estimate future costs. Contractor reports shall be prepared
      in accordance with the instructions contained in the most recently approved versions of DI-
      FNCL-81565, DI-FNCL-81566, and DI-FNCL-81567. The contractor as part of the response
      to the solicitation will [DOD2008a]:
      a.     Accept or propose changes to the approved Contract Cost and Software Data Reporting
            (CSDR) Plan, DD Form 2794, that includes the contract WBS using the approved
            Program Plan and the Contract Plan provided by the DoD program office as the
            baseline. The Contract CSDR Plan will include level 3 of the contract WBS and any
            lower level WBS elements designated by DoD as being high risk, high value, or high
            technical interest. The contractor may further extend the WBS for its own reporting
            purposes.

60 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     b. Negotiate, if appropriate, a revised Contract CSDR Plan that will be submitted by the
        DoD program office to the DCARC for review and the Cost Analysis Improvement
        Group (CAIG) Chairâ€˜s approval. The final approved Contract CSDR Plan will be
        incorporated into the contract.
     c.   IAW DFAR 215.403-5, provide contract cost estimates on the DD Forms 1921, 1921-1
          and 1921-2 using the contract CWBS dictionary proposed in subparagraph a above.
     After contract award the contractor shall:
     d. Provide the final contract WBS and dictionary IAW DI-MGMT-81334 within 60 days
        after contract award. Maintain and update the WBS and dictionary during contract
        execution. Submittals will be no more frequent than CCDR reports.
     e.   Prepare and provide CCDRs IAW DI-FNCL-81565, DI-FNCL- 81566, and DIFNCL-
          81567 and with the approved Contract CSDR Plan.
     f.   Flow down CCDR requirements to any lower tier contractor that will have a contract
          valued at over $50 million or any contracts valued at between $7 million and $50
          million that are designated by the DoD program office as being high risk, high value, or
          high technical interest [DOD 2008a].

EXAMPLE 4
     The metrics should clearly portray variances between planned and actual performance,
     enable early detection or prediction of situations that require management attention, and
     support the assessment of proposed changes on the program. All programs of record with
     any software, regardless of ACAT category, shall define, develop, and implement the
     following minimum set of core metrics specific to their program.
          Software Size
          Cost Schedule (WBS) focus on software)
          Software Quality
          Software Organization
     The core metrics should be tailored and implemented consistent with both of the Program
     officeâ€˜s and the developerâ€˜s internal tools and processes. Program offices and developers
     should establish and agree upon additional metrics or means of insight to identify and
     address software issues deemed critical or unique to the program [USN 2008a]




                               GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

Specify the tracking and analysis of performance Metrics/measures in the RFP [SEI 2007a].

Establish clear performance thresholds for each performance measure [SEI Test 2007].

Performance Metrics/measures must be directly related to the risks you identify, and support the
actions you take to mitigate those risks [SEI 2007a].

If you do not know what decision a measure supports, THROW IT OUT [SEI 2007a].



61 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
 Your RFP should define the indicators and metrics the government needs to track progress,
 quality, schedule, cost, and maintainability. What you should look for when analyzing an
 offerorâ€™s Metrics Usage Plan is â€•control.â€– Through measurement, the processâ€™s internal
 workings are defined and assessed. If an effective process improvement plan is executed (which
 requires that appropriate measurements are taken) data are collected and analyzed to predict
 process failures. Therefore, the offeror must have a corporate mechanism implemented in a
 systematic manner that performs orderly process control and methodical process improvement.
 This can be identified by the measurement methods the company uses to assess the development
 process, analyze the data collected, and feedback corrections for problems within the process
 [USAF 2000].

 After you have identified your program issues (and before contract award) you and your future
 contractor must agree on entry and exit criteria definitions for the proposed software
 development process and products. Entry and exit criteria must also be defined for all data
 inputs, standards of acceptance, schedule and progress estimation, and data collection and
 analysis methods. For instance, there must be an agreement on the definition of source lines-of-
 code and how and when SLOC will be estimated or counted. The entire collection and analysis
 processâ€”all definitions, decisions, and agreementsâ€”should be written into the contract
 [USAF 2000].

 Make sure the software quality metrics and indicators they employ include a clear definition of
 component parts (e.g., SLOC), are accurate and readily collectible, and span the development
 spectrum and functional activities. They must identify metrics early and apply them at the
 beginning of the system engineering and software implementation process. They should also
 develop software Metrics Usage Plan before contract award [USAF 2000].

4.5.2   Section M - Evaluation

EXAMPLE 1
     The contractorâ€˜s customized SRDR and Data Dictionary will be evaluated on the extent to
     which (1) the report captures the Governmentâ€˜s stated need and (2) the data provided is
     integrated with the contractorâ€˜s normal oversight and management procedures [DOD 2008].

4.5.3   Section L - Instructions to Offerors

EXAMPLE 1
     The Government identifies software resources data on the elements identified within the
     attached CSDR Plan, DD Form 2794. The data for each marked element are contained in
     the most recently approved versions of the DI-MGMT-81739 and DI-MGMT-81740. The
     government objective is to collect a subset of the same data that the contractor normally
     collects to oversee and manage software development efforts. Therefore, the Government
     expects the contractor to customize or tailor the sample formats to be consistent with data it
     normally collects. The Government will approve the customized or tailored formats
     proposed by the contractor. The contractor shall provide a SRDR Data Dictionary with the
     customized formats.



62 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     The contractor shall submit the completed SRDR Initial Developer Report within 60 days
     after contract award for the entire software product, and within 60 days after initiation of
     each software release or build. The contractor shall submit a completed SRDR Final
     Developer Report within 60 days of delivery of each delivered software release. The
     contractor shall submit a completed SRDR Final Developer Report for the entire software
     product within 60 days of delivery of the final software element. Report format and other
     delivery requirements are specified in the attached CDR [DOD 2008].

Proposal Requirement #X: Risk Identification/Mitigation [USAF 2005]

      The proposal requirement will be met when the Offeror proposes specific, cost effective, and
      technically sound risk mitigation activities for the prioritized list of risks submitted,
      including burndown plans coordinated to program milestones, for significant risks such that
      risks are mitigated prior to the appropriate program milestone. The risk information exhibits
      an understanding of the risk levels (probability of occurrence and severity of consequence),
      implementation of an approach to address inter/intra-segment and external interface risks,
      and implementation of an approach to mature technologies deemed critical to the proposed
      architecture. The risk analysis adequately justifies these risks and includes isolation of
      causes and determination of effects. The risk information should identify organizational
      responsibilities and provide a realistic work schedule in the IMS and effort in the WBS which
      is consistent with objectives for TSAT/TMOS milestones.

4.16 Trustworthy Software

4.16.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements




                              GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

1.0 Trustworthy Software [DHS 2008]

  1.1 Key definitions [DHS 2008]

        â€•Security controlsâ€– mean the management, operational, and technical controls (that is,
        safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the
        confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information [NIST SP
        800â€“ 53]. This definition includes software.

        â€•Security categoryâ€– means the characterization of information or an information system
        based on an assessment of the potential impact that a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
        availability of such information or information system would have on organizational
        operations, organizational assets, or individuals [FIPS Pub 199].

        â€•Security objectivesâ€– mean confidentiality, integrity, and availability [44 USC, Sec.
        3542].

        â€•Assuranceâ€– means grounds for justified confidence that a claim has been or will be
        achieved. (ISO/IEC 15026).

        â€•Assurance Caseâ€– means representation of a claim or claims, and support for these claims
        (ISO/IEC 15026). A Software Assurance Case includes (software assurance) claims and
        evidence that support those (software assurance) claims. Include other appropriate
        definitions.




75 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
  1.2 Security Category (NOTE: This is an example. Also see [FIPS 199] and [DODI 8500.2,
      Enclosure 4)

       This software system is used for large procurements in a contracting organization and
       contains both sensitive and proprietary supplier information and routine administrative
       information. For the sensitive supplier information, the potential impact from a loss of
       confidentiality is moderate (for example, the loss may result in a significant financial loss),
       the potential impact from a loss of integrity is moderate (for example, the loss may result
       in the effectiveness of the contracting mission is significantly reduced and there is
       significant damage to the information asset), and the potential impact from a loss of
       availability is low (for example, the loss may result in downtime, but there is backup). For
       the routine administrative information, the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality
       is low, the impact from a loss of integrity is low, and the impact from a loss of availability
       is low. Based on 1.2, the resulting security category of the software system is
       {(confidentiality, moderate), (integrity, moderate), (availability, low)} [DHS 2008].

  1.3 Software Security Requirements.

       Based on the security category for the software system, the minimum security
       requirements specified in (NOTE: Reference the external document(s)) are required.
       (NOTE: Minimum security controls may be specified in this paragraph or in an external
       document similar to FIPS Pub 200; National Institute of Standards and Technology
       (NIST) SP 800â€“53; and DODI 8500.2, Enclosure 4) [DHS 2008].

  1.4 Software Assurance Case.

       The Software Assurance Case shall be the primary instrument for refining and monitoring
       software assurance during the life of this contract. The Software Assurance Case shall be
       developed and conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 15026, Systems and software
       engineeringâ€”Systems and software assuranceâ€”Part 2: Assurance Case. The supplier
       shall refine the Software Assurance Case throughout the development process and should
       be based on the software assurance requirements of this contract. The contractor shall
       submit the case for review. (NOTE: Specify when the case should be reviewed, such as
       with the submission of the software design) Lastly, the successful execution of the
       Software Assurance Case shall be a condition for final acceptance of the software
       product/service [DHS 2008].

         Supplemental Information Concerning Cost/Price of Background Inventions

                               GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

The RFP should require offerors to provide a development schedule appropriate to the known
requirements, showing all major milestones, audits, reviews, inspections, and deliverables. It is
expected that this schedule will change as requirements become better defined. Evaluate this
schedule to determine if the offeror understands the need for presenting detailed schedule
information and for tying that information to detailed program requirements. Determine whether
the program tracking system being proposed is part of the companyâ€™s normal management
practices or if it is new for this program. Also, you will want to ensure schedule needs and types
are described and included in the Software Development Plan (SDP) [USAF 2000].

Problems are often created when schedule baselines are established before software requirements
are well defined and understood. government RFP preparers may include schedule information
based on factors that do not account for the system development process or software
requirements. Offerors then inadvertently accept RFP schedule information as a requirement for a
responsive proposal, and prepare their response based on these so-called requirements. This
practice causes offerors to bid to untenable schedules affecting the viability of their submissions,
decreasing the probability they will complete tasks as proposed. One solution â€“ provide minimum
schedule guidance, and require offerors to propose development schedules based on program
requirements and their development approach [USAF 2000].

Where users remain adamant that arbitrary delivery dates must be met, you will do well to work
with them on the concept of evolutionary or incremental deliveries versus a full scope capability.
Even then, it is recommended that you use every persuasive power at your command to educate
them on the exceedingly high failure rate for programs with unrealistic schedules [USAF 2000].

      information in a standard format (e.g., Extensible Markup Language Metadata Interchange
      (XMI) and AP233/ISO 10303). The Contractor shall identify the proposed standards and
      formats to be used. The contractor shall maintain the design information, including any

5.7.1     Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
      Upon contract award, the contractor shall establish a program-wide integrated information
      development environment (IDE) that:
      (a) Contains all program development information, including intermediate and final
          artifacts, both in-work and completed, developed and used as a part of the development
          activity, to include, at a minimum, all design data items, review materials (briefings and
          reports), technical reports and briefings, all software Metrics/measures reports, peer
          review reports, program schedules, and all Software Development Folders (SDF)
          (including all requirements, design documents, code, test cases, test results, and other
          items).
      (b) Provides a web-enabled interface allowing continuous, real-time access (remote and
          local) to all items contained in the Integrated information development environment
          (IDE).
      (c) For information maintained in special formats (such as within database tools used to
          manage requirements), access will be provided either via web-enabled tool interfaces or
          via remote tool invocation, or both, ensuring minimal user access delays.
      (d) Provides continuous, real-time access for all stakeholders, including Government staff,
          contractor staff, subcontractors, Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V)
          activities, and others as necessary and appropriate.
      (e) Segregates information according to need-to-know and security levels, protecting the
          enclaves using access controls and, if necessary, separate networks. For example,
          restricted and proprietary information can be kept private from subcontractors.
      (f) Upon contract completion, the Integrated information development environment (IDE)
          shall be delivered to the Government as a CDRL [USN 2008].




88 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
                               GENERAL RECOMMENDATION

If the Prime proposes a distributed development facility with each major subcontractor using their
own processes, the risk resides in the ability of the prime to deploy an Integrated information
development environment (IDE) and to integrate its overarching processes with the
subcontractorsâ€™ through an organizational and technical interface structure. If the Prime intends to
execute a distributed development environment, its productivity will be lower at the start of the
program unless it plans to implement the Information development environment (IDE) prior to
award and train its subcontractors on the tools that it intend to use [SEI 2007b].

It is important for the acquirer to know and understand the risks arising from prime contractor /
subcontractor process integration to properly monitor and manage these risks. As the two previous
paragraphs indicate, there is a risk of lowered productivity early in the program for either
approach. The RFP should request a plan from the prime contractor addressing this subject, and
ensure that all activities and risks are captured in the Integrated Master Plan (IMP), Integrated
Master Schedule (IMS), and Risk Management Plan (RMP) [SEI 2007b].

Process compatibility topics involve [SEI 2007b]

    ensuring a common vocabulary (i.e., what is the meaning of a HIGH risk exposure)
    ensuring consistent and compatible process goals
    ensuring efficient and clear bi-directional communication of process information
    ensuring a clear understanding of each otherâ€™s processes

5.8.2    Section M - Evaluation

5.8.3    Section L - Instructions to Offerors

EXAMPLE 1

Attachment CD2 to Volume IV: Integrated Master Plan (IMP) [USAF 2005]

      The IMP shall clearly and concisely state the Offerorâ€˜s plans for executing the TMOS
      program from Authority To Proceed (ATP) through deployment. It will include descriptions
      of how management and systems engineering efforts will be conducted, how program tasks
      will be controlled and who, organizationally, will accomplish each task. It should identify
      key management and engineering tasks, their relationships to program milestones, and the
      specific criteria that will be used to track and measure successful task completion. Criteria
      to measure technical progress should include a set of Technical Performance Measures
      (TPMs). The IMP should provide top-to-bottom traceability from the CLINs to Level 4 of the
      CWBS, except for Software Development which shall be traced to Level 5. The IMP shall
      describe: a) key events and accomplishments to be achieved by the Offeror under the
      contract; b) the associated criteria for the events and accomplishments; and c) the processes
      to be used in performing and reporting the tasks required by the contract. The IMP shall
      also include a glossary. The Offeror shall prepare the IMP in a format which clearly and
      succinctly conveys to the Government the information requested above. Offeror format is
      encouraged for this document.
      The IMP identifies the necessary Events, Significant Accomplishments, and associated
      Accomplishment Criteria to meet the intent of the Contractor Statement of Work (CSOW). As
      an event driven document, the IMP tracks program maturity and represents up-front
      planning and commitment, provides the basis for lower-tier planning, instills balanced
      design discipline, and provides a measure of progress in accomplishing TMOS Segment
      objectives. The IMP shall contain selected Narratives to correlate the required processes to
      the achievement of the Significant Accomplishments and Accomplishment Criteria. The IMP
      shall be a single plan for the entire effort, including associate and/or major subcontractor
      activities. The SOO, CSOW, IMP, IMS, and CWBS shall be consistent. This is a contractual
      document and can only be changed by mutual agreement of the parties.
      The Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) provides the schedule information for execution of the
      IMP. The IMS is a contract deliverable item under the CDRL and is to be updated â€•as
      requiredâ€– (to maintain schedule flexibility) in accordance with the requirements of the
      Offerorâ€˜s CDRL.

      Events: An Event is defined to be the initiation/conclusion of an interval of major program
      activity. It represents a decision point related to the system maturity with continued system
      development. Events may be identified in the format of entry and exit events (e.g. Initiate
      CDR and Complete CDR) or they may use entry and exit criteria for each event. As decision
      points for continued activity, Events shall clearly define expected maturity at a specific point
      in the program. Events shall be logically sequenced and may include demonstration
      milestones, major reviews, modeling and simulation results, product deliveries, and other

90 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     key decision points. The Contractor shall include definitions of each Event at the beginning
     of the IMP. The Offeror is encouraged to identify additional Key Events that best reflect the
     proposed program approach. Monthly Program Management Reviews, consisting of
     technical and management aspects, are held to keep the Government informed and facilitate
     timely problem resolution. Software Design Reviews (PDR and CDR) for software
     development shall be scheduled to reflect the Master Software Build Plan and delivery of
     major functionality. Likewise software testing events shall be similarly addressed. For each
     IMP event, there shall be one or more entry or exit Significant Accomplishments (entry or
     exit). The minimum set of Events identified by the Government are:
     1. TMOS Post-Award Requirements Review
     2. TMOS Segment Design Review
     3. TSAT Phase B IPR-2
     4. TMOS Preliminary Design Review (PDR)
     5. TSAT Key Decision Point C
     6. TMOS Critical Design Review (CDR)
     7. TMOS Test Readiness Reviews (TRR) â€“ Conducted at the prior to each major test to
        determine that test procedures are complete and to assure that the Offeror is prepared
        for formal testing.
     8. TMOS Developmental Test and Evaluation
     9. TMOS Operational Test and Evaluation
     10. TMOS Acceptance Review for Deployment
     11. TSAT IOC
     12. TSAT FOC

     Significant Accomplishments: A Significant Accomplishment is a specified result
     substantiating an event that indicates the level of progress or maturity directly related to
     each product/process. Accomplishments shall be measurable. Significant Accomplishments
     are interim or final critical efforts that must be completed prior to entering or exiting an
     event. Entry accomplishments reflect what must be completed to initiate an event. Exit
     accomplishments reflect what must be done for the event to be successfully closed and to
     demonstrate that the project is ready for the next event. Within each Event, Significant
     Accomplishments are grouped to ensure the IMP correctly addresses the interrelationships
     among functional disciplines. Significant Accomplishments shall provide sufficient
     Government insight into the process for achieving objectives of the SOO and CSOW.
     Significant Accomplishments shall be sequenced in a manner that ensures a logical path is
     maintained throughout the IMP. One or more Accomplishment Criteria shall define each
     Significant Accomplishment.
     Significant Accomplishments may include:
     1. A desired result at a specified Event, which indicates a level of design maturity (or
        progress) directly related to each product and process
     2. A discrete step in a process.
     3. A description of interrelationship between different functional disciplines.




91 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     Accomplishment Criteria: Accomplishment Criteria are definitive indicators of system
     maturity required to declare completion of a Significant Accomplishment. Accomplishment
     Criteria shall be tied to the completion of detailed tasks, shall be measurable, shall avoid the
     use of â€•percent complete,â€– and shall avoid citing completion of data reports rather than
     results of data reports. Accomplishment Criteria shall include the use of Technical
     Performance Measures (TPM) and metrics to track detailed tasks in the IMS. The TPM and
     metrics information should include which measures will be flowed down to subcontractors
     and unless otherwise stated, the Government will have access to data on the TPMs and
     metrics listed in the IMP. Accomplishment Criteria may include:
     1. The completion of specific detailed tasks.
     2. The confirmation of the value of significant technical parameters.
     3. The completion of documents, which provide results of in-process verification
        (successfully completed analysis or other testing activities).
     4. The completion of critical activities required by the Contractorâ€˜s program
        plans/operating instructions.

     Narratives: Narratives are concise summaries providing visibility into the Offerorâ€˜s key
     functional and management processes and procedures, how they relate to the integrated
     product development process, and an overview of the efforts required to implement them.
     The Narratives shall address only the key elements of implementing or developing a
     process/procedure (i.e. what the process will be and how it will be implemented and
     tracked). The Narratives facilitate Offeror and Government understanding of and
     commitment to critical processes/procedures prior to contract award. The Narratives shall
     complement the respective Significant Accomplishment and Accomplishment Criteria
     sections by indicating where in the particular process the criteria apply. Each narrative
     subject area shall include a brief objective statement of desired results traceable to the
     CSOW, the processes applicable to that objective, a listing of any Government, industry,
     national and international specifications and standards to be used achieve the objective. The
     Offeror shall clearly state which of these documents are compliance and which are reference
     and if they will be tailored. Compliance documents are contractually binding, while
     reference documents are for guidance only. The Software Development Plan will be a
     compliance document. Narratives shall not include rationale for using particular processes.
     The Narrative shall be consistent with applicable technical and management approaches
     described in the Mission Capability volume of the proposal.
     The Offeror shall include the following process Narratives in the IMP (not listed in order of
     importance) and any others deemed critical to successful execution of the program. Each
     process Narrative shall include, as a minimum, processes encompassing all work tasks
     contained in the applicable WBS element:


     1. Program Management. Define the processes to be used to plan, execute, track and
        control overall program progress with respect to cost and schedule to include staff
        allocation and EVMS planning. Provide decision-making flow within the team to include
        subcontractor management. Describe your communications strategy that discusses how
        information will be shared effectively across your team and with the Government, other
        TSAT segments and associate contractor teams. Outline the infrastructure (tools,
        Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), personnel, processes) necessary to accomplish the


92 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
         strategy, including a team readiness assessment. Provide details of how classified
         information will be exchanged physically and electronically if proposed.
     2. Systems Engineering. Define the processes to be used for conducting requirements
        analyses, performing functional analyses, allocating performance requirements,

5.9     Management Plan Approach

5.9.1    Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

5.9.2    Section M - Evaluation

EXAMPLE 1

The proposal requirement will be met when the Offeror [USAF 2005]

      Proposes an effective management/subcontractor team structure and plan that integrates the
      management/subcontractor team structure for successful program execution.
      Proposes a plan to obtain, and more importantly keep, highly skilled, effective personnel on
      the program, especially key personnel. The Offeror provides resumes of personnel in key
      positions that reflect experience needed to perform successfully.
      Proposes effective communications and collaboration with the Government and other
      segment contractor teams to manage program-wide integration and risk reduction efforts.
      The Offerorâ€˜s strategy promotes near real-time information exchange, including access to
      all technical data (including classified data), within the TMOS contractor team and with the
      Government.
      Provides consistent program contract documentation. The IMS identifies critical paths and
      clearly provides buffer time to accommodate unexpected program events. The IMP should
      include details of metrics (including metrics from team members) that will be used to
      monitor contract performance and details which metrics will be available for government
      use. The Software Development Capability Evaluation (SDCE) responses must be consistent
      with the contents of the IMP.
      Proposes a plan to ensure the entire TMOS contractor team maintains a disciplined product
      development approach consistent with Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)
      Maturity Level 3 or higher, including a plan to ensure this performance continues
      throughout the life of the contract. The tasks for ensuring this should be included in the IMP
      and the IMS. The plan should include which model you plan to use (e.g. CMMI-SE/SW,
      CMMI-SE/SW/IPPD/SS) [USAF 2005].

5.12.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

5.12.2 Section M - Evaluation

EXAMPLE 1
    Subfactor 1. Offerorâ€˜s Open Architecture Past Performance Submissions [USN 2007a]
    In assessing the Offerorâ€˜s past performance submissions on similar contracts, the
    Government will consider how well the Offeror implemented XXX Open Architecture
    principles and used a modular open system approach, including:
    â€¢   The degree to which the Offeror demonstrated that its design approach, plans for
        technology insertion, and sustainment strategy were consistent with the modular open
        systems requirements.
    â€¢   The degree to which the Offeror managed the impact of changing requirements and
        evolving technology on the systemâ€˜s ability to continue to satisfy improved capabilities
        over time.
    â€¢   The degree to which the Offerorâ€˜s test and evaluation planning contained the means for
        testing the conformance to open standards to ensure the openness of key interfaces
        throughout the system life cycle.
    â€¢   The degree to which the Offerorâ€˜s approach contains capabilities to easily and quickly
        update, revise, and change the system as threats (warfighting and information assurance
        threats) or technologies Commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) or reusable) evolve;
        [USN 2007a].

EXAMPLE 2
     Past performance is a measure of the Governmentâ€˜s confidence in the Offerorâ€˜s, teaming
     partners, and major and critical subcontractorsâ€˜ performance on relevant contracts. The
     evaluation is based on, but not limited to, systems engineering, network design, information
     assurance (IA), network operations, ground control systems, protected and secure military
     communications, digital communications, past and present performance questionnaire, and
     software development capability such as the Software Engineering Instituteâ€˜s (SEI) Software
     Capability Evaluation (SCE) and the (Air Force Materiel Command) AFMC Software
     Development Capability Evaluation (SDCE) or equivalent, and commercial efforts.
     Past performance will be evaluated by reviewing Contractor Performance Assessment
     Reports (CPARs) and information included by the Offeror on recent and relevant contracts.
     The Government may communicate with any other sources on any contract deemed relevant.
     The main purpose of the past performance evaluation is to appropriately consider each
     Offerorâ€˜s demonstrated record of contract compliance by supplying products and services
     that meet customerâ€˜s needs, including cost and schedule.
         (a) The recency and relevancy of the past performance information is critical in
             determining what contracts/programs should be evaluated and should be
             individually tailored to this acquisition. Recent performance will have greater
             impact on the performance confidence assessment than older performance. Recency
             is normally performance occurring within the last five (5) years. In determining
             relevancy, Offerors should make every effort to submit references from efforts

99 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
                 similar to the projected TMOS content. Offerorâ€˜s contracts will receive a relevancy
                 rating for each of the four subfactors. Subcontracts will receive a relevancy rating
                 for the subfactor(s) identified in the proposal. Contracts focusing on experience with
                 protected and secure, survivable communications systems and military/commercial
                 network management will have the greatest weight.
          (b) Offerors will be given the opportunity to address any negative or derogatory past
              performance information received during this evaluation (subject to the restrictions
              of FAR 15.306(e)(4)).

      Past performance will be assigned one of the following ratings by the evaluation team:


                             TABLE 3 - PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS

HIGH CONFIDENCE            Based on the Offerorâ€˜s performance record, the government has high confidence the Offeror
                           will successfully perform the required effort.

   SIGNIFICANT             Based on the Offerorâ€˜s performance record, the government has significant confidence the
   CONFIDENCE              Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

   SATISFACTORY            Based on the Offerorâ€˜s performance record, the government has confidence the Offeror will
    CONFIDENCE             successfully perform the required effort. Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any
                           problems.

    UNKNOWN                No performance record is identifiable. See FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) and (iv).
   CONFIDENCE

LITTLE CONFIDENCE Based on the Offerorâ€˜s performance record, substantial doubt exists that the Offeror will
                  successfully perform the required effort.

  NO CONFIDENCE            Based on the Offerorâ€˜s performance record, extreme doubt exists that the Offeror will
                           successfully perform the required effort.


      In determining relevance, consideration will be given to similar technology, type of effort
      (development, maintenance, contract scope, schedule and type). Tables M4.5.1 thru M4.5.4
      will be used as a guide for determining relevancy by Subfactor. These tables outline the
      criteria for evaluating contract relevance and provide performance assessment focus areas.

5.12.3 Section L - Instructions to Offerors

EXAMPLE 1
     Offerors shall also submit, as a part of their proposal, an Software Development Plan (SDP)
     rationale which describes why their specific approach is appropriate for the system to be
     procured and how their proposed processes are equivalent to those articulated by CMMI
     capability level 3 [USN 2007a].
     Offerors shall submit a description of previous experience in developing software using the
     same or similar processes and approaches as proposed for this solicitation. Offerors shall
     describe the extent to which personnel who contributed to these previous efforts will be
     supporting this solicitation. Offerors shall also describe any previous CMMI or equivalent
     model-based process maturity appraisals performed. As a part of this description, offerors
     shall identify the organizational entity and location where the appraisal was performed, the
     type of evaluation, the organization performing the evaluation, and the level earned [USN
     2007a].

EXAMPLE 2

Relevant Past and Present Performance [USAF 2005]

General

     Past and present performance information is required of the Offeror, major & critical
     subcontractors, and teaming partners proposed to perform key aspects of the effort the
     Offeror considers essential to overall successful performance.
     The information provided to the Performance Confidence Assessment Group (PCAG) in
     Volume V and responses to the Performance Questionnaire are two means used by the
     PCAG to obtain relevant past and present performance information. The Government
     reserves the right to obtain information from any other sources (e.g., Air Force CPARS) to
     assess Offerorâ€˜s past and present performance. Problems not mentioned by the Offeror, but
     found by the PCAG during the course of assessing relevant past performance, may be
     addressed by the PCAG.
     Each Offeror with relevant performance information must send a Past Performance
     Questionnaire (Attachment 2) to at least two (2) points of contact (POCs) for each contract
     submitted with the Past Performance Volume. Preferred points of contact are, in order of
     descending preference: program or project manager, PCO, technical or engineering lead, or
     Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO). For Government programs, if the
     subcontractorâ€˜s direct customer was another contractor, then the questionnaire shall be sent
     to the Government customer where applicable. For commercial contracts, the following
     order of precedence is suggested: program or project manager then contract manager. The
     Offeror shall send a standard transmittal letter (Attachment 2) to request that all POCs
     complete the Questionnaire. The points of contact shall return completed questionnaires via
     the instructions identified in the questionnaire.
     Past Performance information concerning subcontractors and/or teaming partners cannot
     be disclosed to a private party without the subcontractorâ€˜s or teaming partnerâ€˜s consent.
     Because a prime contractor is a private party, the Government will need that consent before
     disclosing subcontractor/teaming partner past performance information to the prime during
     exchanges. In an effort to assist the PCAG in assessing the past performance relevancy and
     confidence, the Government requests that a consent form (Attachment 2) be completed by
101 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     each major and critical subcontractor and teaming partner identified in your proposal. The
     completed consent forms should be submitted as part of your Past Performance Volume V,
     Section 1 (not subject to page count limitation).
     A separate copy of the client authorization letter(s) (Attachment 2) sent to each commercial
     POC, shall be included in Volume V (not subject to page count limitation) for the PCAGâ€˜s
     use in case additional questionnaires need to be sent after submission of this volume. Copies
     of all remaining client authorization letter(s) shall be submitted within one week of proposal
     submission.
     Early Proposal Information
     Each Offeror is required to submit the Past Performance Volume, two (2) weeks prior to the
     date set for receipt of proposals.
     Relevant Contracts
     Submit Past Performance information on a maximum of five (5) recent contracts that the
     Offeror considers most relevant in demonstrating their ability to perform the proposed effort.
     Offerorâ€˜s contracts will receive a relevancy rating for each of the four subfactors. Also,
     include information on a maximum of three (3) recent contracts performed by each of the
     Offerorâ€˜s major & critical subcontractors and teaming partners that the Offeror considers
     most relevant in demonstrating their ability to perform the proposed effort. Include rationale
     supporting the assertion of relevance. The PCAG will assess an Offerorâ€˜s relevant
     demonstrated performance as it relates to Mission Capability sub-factors, wherever
     possible: (Subfactor 1) Program Management and Systems Engineering, (Subfactor 2)
     Network Functions and Architecture, (Subfactor 3) Network Management and Operations,
     (Subfactor 4) Software Engineering, Development, and Management. The PCAG will assess
     performance for high, medium-high or medium relevance contracts only. Subcontracts will
     receive a relevancy rating for the subfactor(s) identified in the proposal. Additional details
     relating to how the PCAG will conduct its assessment and determine relevance are
     contained in Section M. â€“ Evaluation Criteria, paragraph 4.5, Factor 3: Past Performance.
     Note that the Government generally will not consider performance on a newly awarded
     contract without a performance history or on an effort that concluded more than 5 years
     prior to this source selection. If no relevant past or present performance information exists,
     do not submit a Volume V. Instead, explain in the proposal transmittal letter that no relevant
     past or present performance exists. We will treat an Offerorâ€˜s lack of past performance as an
     unknown performance risk, having no positive or negative evaluative significance.
     For the purpose of this solicitation, relevant past or present performance may be a part of
     any Federal, state, and local Government or their agenciesâ€˜ contract, or a commercial
     contract or subcontract.
     Specific Content
     Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the
     proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. This may include a
     discussion of efforts accomplished by the Offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior
     contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. The Offeror is
     required to clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and
     the effects of those actions, in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified. For
     example, submittal of quality performance indicators or other management indicators that
     clearly support that an Offeror has overcome past problems is required. Categorize the
     relevance information into the specific Mission Capability sub-factors used to evaluate the
     proposal. Organize relevant past/present performance information in the following manner:

102 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
        Section 1 â€“ Volume Introduction
        Provide a brief introduction to the volume and overview its organization.
        Organizational Structure and Responsibilities. Describe the organizational structure for
        the participating divisions within the prime contractor and the submitted major & critical
        subcontractors and teaming partners. Summarize the responsibilities of each
        organizational member. Provide an estimate of the total dollar value each participant
        will expend.
        Organizational Structure Change History. Many companies have acquired, been
        acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their
        divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have
        taken place during the time of performance of relevant present or past efforts or between
        conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection. As a result, it is sometimes
        difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this acquisition. To facilitate
        this relevancy determination, provide a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the
        last 5 years, including all current and previous CAGE & DUNS codes, in the
        organization of the company, team partners and major subcontractors. As part of this
        explanation, show how these changes impact the performance of any efforts the Offeror
        identifies for past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment. Since the
        Government intends to consider present and past performance information provided by
        other sources as well as that provided by the Offeror(s), the "roadmap" should be both
        specifically applicable to the efforts the Offeror identifies and general enough to apply to
        efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources.
        Contract Data Matrix. Provide the following data for each relevant contract in
        matrix/data table form
                 Contractor name and location of performing organization, including all current
                 and previous CAGE codes and DUNS numbers.
                 Name, address, telephone number, fax numbers and initial tracking status for:
                 Procuring Contracting Officers, Contract Administrators, or Administrative
                 Contracting Officers, Program, Project, or Subcontract Managers, Technical
                 Representatives, and Other Cognizant Authorities (e.g. previous program
                 managers, POCs, technical leads)
                 Contract or subcontract number, name, type, and award date.
                 Awarded cost/price and final (or projected) cost/price.
                 Original delivery schedule and final (or projected) delivery schedule.
                 Percentage of fee for each major period during the last 5 years for Fee or
                 Incentive-type awards, together with rating and rationale.
                 Questionnaire Tracking Record. Provide status of Past Performance
                 Questionnaires.
                 Consent/Authorization Forms. Insert consent forms and client authorization
                 forms on all subcontractors and/or teaming partners.
        Section 2 â€“ Relevant Past and Present Performance (Prime Offeror)
        This section contains relevant past/present performance, as described in Section L,
        paragraph 7.3, pertaining to the Prime Offeror. Limit this portion to five pages or less
        per contract or subcontract using the formatting instructions for the Offerorâ€˜s proposal.


103 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
        Description of Work: Provide a brief narrative for each contract or subcontract listed.
        Explain the nature of the work performed and how it is relevant to the TMOS effort in
        terms of technology, type of effort (development, production, maintenance), contract
        scope, schedule, and risk.
        Relevancy Matrix. Complete a matrix for each contract or subcontract as shown in the
        example below. The left-hand column of the matrix contains rows for each of the critical
        Mission Capability (MC) sub-factors (SF1 Program Management and Systems
        Engineering, SF2 Network Functions and Architecture, SF3 Network Management and
        Operations, and SF4 Software Engineering, Development, and Management. The middle
        column rates the degree of relevance (Not Relevant = 0, Low = 1, Medium = 3, Medium-
        High = 4 or High = 5) that the Offeror feels the contract or subcontract has to the
        Mission Capability for this solicitation. Use the relevancy criteria described in Section
        M, paragraph 2.3, Factor 3: Past Performance, to do this rating. Leave the rating blank
        for any sub-factors that have no relevance. The right-hand column summarizes in two or
        three bullets the rationale for the relevancy rating. Text narrative in this section can be
        used to amplify the entries in the matrix.

5.13     Process Maturity

5.13.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

5.13.2 Section M - Evaluation

EXAMPLE 1
       Factor x â€“ Software development process experience [USN 2007a]
       Description: The Government will evaluate the offerorâ€˜s previous experience in developing
       software using the same or similar approach as proposed for this solicitation. The results of
       any standard model-based process maturity appraisals performed within 24 months prior to
       proposal submission, and the number of proposed staff experienced in using these processes
       will be part of the evaluation criteria [USN 2007a].

EXAMPLE 2
       The Government will evaluate the software process by reviewing the offerorâ€˜s Software
       Process Improvement Plan and by using the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) developed
       technique, the Standard CMMI Appraisal Methodology for Process Improvement (SCAMPI).
       The Government will determine the software process capability by investigating the offerorâ€˜s
       current strengths and weaknesses in key process areas defined in the SEI report CMU/SEI-
       2006-TR-008 â€•CMMI for Development, Version 1.2â€– [USAF 1996].
       The Government will perform a SCAMPI on each offeror by reviewing current programs at
       the site proposed on this contract. The evaluation will be an organizational composite. It will
       be substantiated through individual interviews and reviews of documentation, of the offeror
       strengths and weaknesses in process areas relative to Maturity Level 3 (i.e., the extent to
       which an offeror meets or exceeds Maturity Level 3 criteria. The on-site appraisers may be
       separate and distinct from the proposal evaluation team and may include a Government
       contracting representative. The appraisal team will have been trained and experienced in the
       SCAMPI methods [USAF 1996].


                                 GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
 Include capability evaluation as a criterion for selection [SEI SASS].
 A SCAMPI can be used to support the Management Factor evaluation
 [SEI SASS].
 Assure software processes defined by the offeror are reflected in the draft Software Development
 Plan (SDP), and in the submitted Integrated Master Plan (IMP) and Integrated Master Schedule
 (IMS), and that they include processes for handling (NDI) software, software as government
 furnished materials (GFM), and commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS)) software [SMC 2004].
 To ensure the software process enacted for your program is predictable, repeatable, and
 manageable in terms of quality, cost, schedule, and performance, you should evaluate the
 offerorâ€™s software development capabilities prior to (or during) source selection. Remember, you
 are buying the process as well as the product! Performing a software development
 capability assessment will help you identify risks associated with the offerorâ€™s approach.


105 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
 Risk identification is possible, since you will have:
 1.     An understanding of how the organization managed software development efforts in the
        past; and
 2.     The opportunity to compare past performance with the proposed software development
        process.

 Therefore, you must pay due attention to the offerorâ€™s software development processes, starting
 with overall assessments, which focus on the details of tools, metrics, personnel facilities,
 management control, and language experience. Based on the maturity level of the selected
 contractor, you should consider customizing your contract to adapt that offerorâ€™s strengths and
 weaknesses. For example, if the contractor has achieved a high level of maturity (3 or above),
 you may decide that online access to the contractorâ€™s development environment and
 management status reports (e.g., cost, schedule, risk management and metrics data) is an
 effective alternative to the traditional oversight mechanisms of formal reviews and
 submission/approval of data items. Alternatively, if an offerorâ€™s process for coordinating the
 efforts of different engineering disciplines and stake holders is relatively weak, you may add a
 requirement for an on-site liaison to support coordination with users and the contractors
 developing interfacing systems [USAF 2000].

5.13.3 Section L - Instructions to Offerors

EXAMPLE 1
      Offerors shall submit a description of previous experience in developing software using the
      same or similar processes and approaches as proposed for this solicitation. Offerors shall
      describe the extent to which personnel who contributed to these previous efforts will be
      supporting this solicitation. Offerors shall also describe any previous CMMI or equivalent
      model-based process maturity appraisals performed. As a part of this description, offerors
      shall identify the organizational entity and location where the appraisal was performed, the
      type of evaluation, the organization performing the evaluation, and the level earned [USN
      2007a].


                                    GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

It is better to not list specific maturity levels from a specific model. Consider including
information on the Process Areas instead [SEI SASS].

The five key software RFP elements are [USAF 2000]
    software development process
      contractor documentation and formats
      contractor control of baselines
      direct technical visibility
      proactive risk management

106 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
Software development process: A mature contractor process helps ensure that the contractor will
produce supportable, quality software on schedule in a predictable, consistent manner. The
contractorâ€™s practices must also be documented, maintained current by the development team, and
be available for government review. This supports the need for continuous verification of process
maturity and effectiveness [USAF 2000].

Contractor documentation and formats: Documentation deliverables should maximize the use of
information in the form and format used to develop the software [USAF 2000].

Contractor control of baselines: Allowing the contractor to retain configuration and engineering
control of baselines until they are stable, frees the developer from the government review and
approval cycle which also supports partnering [USAF 2000].

Direct technical visibility: This may be implemented with the following requirements
[USAF 2000]:

    The contractor must plan and implement a means for sharing software development
    information with the Government. The contractor should be required to provide access to
    current working documentation in the language and format normally used for software
    development. This includes Government access to software engineering tools and databases.
    Documentation, where possible, should reside in electronic format in the automated software
    engineering environment.
    The contractor must plan the information sharing mechanism so that little or no contractor
    assistance is required for Government personnel to access information. The information can
    be used as a basis for formal Government recommendations to the contractor, and whenever
    practical, should be used to simplify the formal technical review process. Thus, you need not
    provide formal approval of shared information on a day-to-day basis.
Proactive risk management: In the past, risk was reduced by requiring the delivery of a series of
documents. Each deliverable was typically reviewed and approved by the Government to ensure
quality and to independently verify contractor adherence to schedule. In principle, this document-
driven contract monitoring was an efficient way to manage software development risk and
perform program oversight. In practice, the oversight role progressively removed the developer
from responsibility for design as each new document was approved. Since the Government
performed the review and found the errors, the contractor only had to deliver a product on
schedule and correct any errors the Government found. This approach too often led to increased
reliance on testing and diffused the responsibility for quality problems, which often remained
hidden until system delivery [USAF 2000].

5.15 Software Development Plan (SDP)

5.15.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
     Within the SOW, there shall be a â€•Technical Approachâ€– section. This section describes the
     XXXâ€˜s expectations regarding the technical approach to be taken by the offerors. It is
     recommended that these expectations be based on the characteristics of the system to be
     developed and not mandate any specific approach, but rather define the criteria with which
     proposed approaches will be evaluated. In some cases, however, specific approaches may be
     required based on XXX needs and the system to be acquired [USN 2007a].
     Within the â€•Technical Approachâ€– section, there shall be a subsection titled â€•Software
     Engineering Approach,â€– containing at a minimum the following language [USN 2007a]:
     Software Engineering
     The contractor shall define a software development approach appropriate for the computer
     software effort to be performed under this solicitation. This approach shall be documented in
     a (Software Development Plan (SDP)). The contractor shall follow this Software
     Development Plan (SDP) for all computer software to be developed or maintained under this
     effort [USN 2007a].
     The Software Development Plan (SDP) shall define the offerorâ€˜s proposed life cycle model
     and the processes used as a part of that model. In this context, the term â€•life cycle modelâ€– is
     as defined in IEEE/EIA Std 12207.O. The Software Development Plan (SDP) shall describe
     the overall life cycle and shall include primary, supporting, and organizational processes
     based on the work content of this solicitation. In accordance with the framework defined in
     IEEE/EIA Std. 12207.O, the Software Development Plan (SDP) shall define the processes,
     the activities to be performed as a part of the processes, the tasks which support the
     activities, and the techniques and tools to be used to perform the tasks. Because IEEE/EIA
     Std. 12207 does not prescribe how to accomplish the task, the offeror must provide this
     detailed information so the XXX can assess whether the offerorâ€˜s approach is viable
     [USN 2007a].
     The Software Development Plan (SDP) shall contain the information defined by IEEE/EIA
     Std. 12207.1, section 5.2.1 (generic content) and the Plans or procedures in Table 1 of
     IEEE/EIA Std. 12207.1. In all cases, the level of detail shall be sufficient to define all
     software development processes, activities, and tasks to be conducted. Information provided
     must include, as a minimum, specific standards, methods, tools, actions, strategies, and
     responsibilities associated with development and qualification [USN 2007a].

5.15.2 Section M - Evaluation

EXAMPLE 1
     At a minimum, the following three evaluation factors relating to the offerorâ€˜s software
     development process shall be included in Section M [USN 2007a].

5.17 Software Integrated Process Team

5.17.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
     Upon contract award, the Contractor and the Government shall jointly establish a Software
     Integrated Process Team. This team shall consist of contractor and Government
     representatives, and shall be co-chaired by the program office Chief Software Engineer and
     the contractor Chief Software Engineer (to include subcontractor Chief Software Engineers
     as appropriate). The Software Integrated Process Team should be tasked to define,
     document, monitor, and improve the software development approach being used for the
     software effort. Specifically, the Software Integrated Process Team shall:
     â€¢   Define and document the software development approach to be used for the work effort.
         The approach is to be documented in the contractorsâ€˜ Software Development Plan
         (SDP), which is to be based on the proposed Software Development Plan (SDP)
         submitted with the offerorâ€˜s proposal.
     â€¢   Secure Government approval for the Software Development Plan (SDP). Approval is
         facilitated by having Government representatives serving on the Software Integrated
         Process Team.
     â€¢   Identify and make process improvements to the software approach, and document these
         in the Software Development Plan (SDP). These improvements are to be based on
         lessons-learned, suggestions from staff, industrial advancements, and other sources.
     â€¢   Control all changes to the Software Development Plan (SDP).
     â€¢   Monitor development progress, assess effectiveness of the development approach, and
         monitor adherence to the defined process. One key mechanism for monitoring is
         attendance at technical reviews conducted in accordance with the Software
         Development Plan (SDP) and the Navy Technical Review process. Another is the use of
         a separately-scheduled process assessment review (Independent Technical Assessment
         (ITA)), conducted specifically to determine degree of adherence to the Software
         Development Plan (SDP) process and to assess the effectiveness of the Software
         Development Plan (SDP) as it is being applied.
     â€¢   Monitor industry-wide lessons-learned, evolution of standards, advances in relevant
         technology, tool utility and availability, and other information that may prove to be
         valuable for the software work effort.
     â€¢   Advise program management in areas relating to the software effort.
     The Software Integrated Process Team is not responsible for management of the software
     effort, for performing software quality assurance, or for acting as an Independent
     Verification and Validation (IV&V) agent. The IPT however shall rely on existing program
     management and on the QA/IV&V function to provide sufficient information to facilitate
     their monitoring of progress and adherence to plan [USN 2008].

5.19.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements


                              GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

 The SOW/SOO should define an objective for efficient, life-cycle software support consistent
 with total system requirements and should state that software supportability requirements and
 support characteristics are to be managed as an integral part of system development [SEI SASS].

 Support planning addresses the development acquisition and entails request for proposal (RFP)
 development that provides for delivery of full documentation, data rights, and delivery of the
 software engineering environment (SEE used by the developer [USAF 2000].

 The SOO defines an objective for efficient life-cycle software support consistent with total
 system requirements. The SOO states that software supportability requirements and support
 characteristics are to be managed as an integral part of system development [USAF 2000].

 You should specify the following characteristics to ensure your software acquisition is
 supportable [USAF 2000]:

     Module size. Module size affects software supportability. Module size (a typical computer
     software component [CSC]) should generally not exceed 100 source lines of code (SLOC).
     Complexity. Application complexity affects software supportability. One generally accepted
     complexity measure is McCabeâ€™s Cyclomatic Complexity Measure, which should not
     exceed 10 for a given module.
     Programming language. The use of widely-accepted, higher-order programming languages
     to develop software enhances software supportability.
     Spare memory. The availability of installed spare memory improves software supportability.
     Spare memory permits the incorporation of enhancements and the correction of latent
     deficiencies. The effect of spare memory on supportability was calculated for the E-3
     AWACS where two similar radars were delivered with 9 percent spare and 34 percent spare
     memory, respectively for the APY-1 and the APY-2. Measurements revealed a 3 to 1
     difference in cost and schedule impact when making the same change to both E-3 radars.
     Spare computer throughput. The availability of installed spare throughput affects the
     software supportability by permitting the incorporation of enhancements and the correction
     of latent deficiencies.
     Spare computer system input/output. The availability of installed spare input/output affects
     software supportability.

5.19.2 Section M - Evaluation


                               GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

 Consider making support a selection criteria [SEI SASS].

 If licensing is an issue, this can be included as evaluation criteria [SEI SASS].

 The higher the quality of the initial system, the easier it will be to support. Therefore, the
 offerorâ€™s approach to supportability must be a major source selection criterion [USAF 2000].

 To ensure a prospective offerorâ€™s systems engineering and software development processes
 adequately address the supportability of software, it is imperative you carefully evaluate the
 offerorâ€™s software development processes during source selection [USAF 2000].

 Software Development Plan (SDP). Require the submission of a Software Development Plan
 (SDP) with offerorsâ€™ proposals that states how they intend to ensure their development process
 addresses supportability relative to the systems engineering process. This plan is evaluated
 during source selection [USAF 2000].

 The way you structure the RFP to acquire and develop your initial software can profoundly
 impact the availability and usefulness of the required support environment. Therefore, you must
 require that all offerors describe their plans for supportability as part of their proposal
 submission [USAF 2000].



5.19.3 Section L - Instructions to Offerors


                               GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

 The following supportability issues must be covered in the Instructions to Offerors
 [USAF 1996]:

     the methodology used to perform software sizing and cost estimating and the approach to be
     followed during software development
     the rationale used for computer resource timing and sizing estimates and description of how
     spare I/O utilization (channels or data rates), CPU throughput utilization, memory utilization
     requirements will be met
     a description of any teaming and subcontractor arrangements
     the skill levels required for computer resources development and their availability within the
     corporate structure
     the method to be used for risk control
     any planned use of firmware


117 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     any plans for reusing or modifying existing software
     a clear definition of all assumptions used during proposal preparation
     plans for the development of prototype software
     plans and procedures for generating and using software metrics
     a disclosure statement of defect removal efficiency. This should include their definition of
     defects and what defects are included in the metric and the method of calculating the metric
     [USAF 1996].

Instructions to Offerors (ITO). The ITO and source selection evaluation criteria must specifically
address those areas you consider critical processes. The evaluation criteria should describe what
is required of the offerorsâ€™ proposal and how it will be evaluated. The Aeronautical Systems
Center has developed an RFP template which provides general and specific guidance on
preparing the RFP for software-intensive systems [USAF 2000].

Your RFP must require that offerors plan for supportability by stipulating that the software be
developed with a supportable architecture that anticipates change, uses accepted protocols and
interfaces, and has documentation consistent with the code. This can only be achieved during
initial software development and must be addressed upfront in the development contract. The
higher the quality of the initial system, the easier it will be to support. Therefore, the offerorâ€™s
approach to supportability must be a major source selection criterion [USAF 2000].

Whether a contractor maintains the software, or it is transitioned to in-house government
maintainers, the maintainer must have the original developerâ€™s SEE and other essential tools for
proper code maintenance. The following deliverables must be required [USAF 2000]:


     data rights to make and install changes
     source code and documentation adequate to understand the code
     computer resources (SEE, computers, compilers, etc.) needed to modify the source code and
     produce object code
     equipment and support software to test the subject code, to diagnose problems, and to test
     solutions, enhancements, and modifications
     equipment needed to distribute and install the new software
     a workable system to identify problems, resolve new requirements, and manage the support
     workload
     skilled personnel to perform required maintenance tasks [USAF 2000]

5.20 Systems Engineering Approach

5.20.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

5.20.2 Section M - Evaluation

EXAMPLE 1
     The proposal requirement will be met when the Offeror proposes:
     An effective approach for leading the effort to flow down and track network requirements,
     including updates, for the TSAT system. This should include ensuring the proper flow to the
     space, TMOS and terminal segment, to preliminary/revised interface control documents, and
     to segment and system test plans. The Offeror proposes comprehensive systems engineering
     supporting the generation of network requirements updates and the flowdown of TMOS
     segment requirements across and down to the elements, supportable components and
     associated interfaces.
     Comprehensive systems engineering processes for development of TGBE (TSAT GIG Border
     Element) functions and interfaces.
     Effective configuration management for maintaining a TMOS program baseline, including
     the TMOS specification tree.
     Modeling and Simulation (M&S) plans that effectively address design, development, system
     integration and test, risk, and evolving requirements. The Offeror proposes an effective
     approach to validating models and disseminating program modeling results and simulation
     analysis with external segments and programs, including Space Segment and SE&I. The
     Offeror clearly explains an effective approach to performing system level network M&S.
     Effective use of demonstration and prototyping to provide early risk reduction of
     requirements uncertainty, to evaluate TMOS concept and design alternatives, to evaluate
     TNOM user interfaces, and to obtain feedback from TSAT users and TNOM operators. The
     Offeror clearly explains, in the SEMP, a comprehensive and effective requirements
     maturation process used to manage the specification life cycle, from initial proposal through
     maturation into final specification(s). The plan explains how the maturation process
     effectively incorporates user feedback and technical performance assessment of
     demonstrations and prototypes. The plan clearly explains how requirements deficiencies are
     promptly identified, fully characterized, and appropriately remedied. The plan
     comprehensively identifies and characterizes existing requirements deficiencies, including
     those related to timing and performance.
     The Offeror provides plans and processes for a test and verification program that address at
     a minimum: 1) The leadership of system level test activities for the network verification
     effort, including providing inputs and coordinating changes to the system level Verification
     Cross Reference Matrix / Requirements Verification Plans (VCRM/RVPs); 2) Support for
     TSAT SE&I test and verification planning, including support for development of the System
     Test and Verification Plan (STVP); 3) Development of TMOS segment and lower level
     VCRM/RVPs which support the system TRD and the TMOS TRD; 4) early systems
     integration testing; 5) The TMOS portion of TSAT to GIG interoperability testing and the
     TMOS portion of the Space and Terminal segment testing; and 6) Plans for testing COTS
     products.
     An integrated logistics effort leading to an operationally suitable, sustainable support system
     infrastructure. The Offeror should demonstrate comprehensive planning for each element of
119 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), placing special emphasis on the following topics:
     potential depot level maintenance in partnership with Government facilities, life cycle spare
     parts availability, and pre-operational support planning. The logistics effort should
     encompass all phases of the program, and be fully integrated into the System Engineering
     Management Plan (SEMP).
     An effective systems engineering process describing the activities to be used on the program
     to ensure all TRD requirements translate into a TSAT network architecture and TMOS
     component systems and software architectures (TNOM, TGBE and TSAT Network Services).
     The systems engineering process should also describe the activities to flow these
     architectures into implementation, COTS selection, integration, and maintenance.

                    Offerors will be inserted] it intends to use within its proposed solution. Exceptions
                    regarding reuse of pre-existing items must be accompanied by justification, such as
                    cost (both of adoption and life cycle support), schedule, functional and non-
                    functional performance, etc.

                development and delivery of competitive alternatives or designs for software or other
                components or modules on an ongoing basis. This information may be used as part of
                peer review processes, to support the Integrated Product Team (IPT), and to facilitate
                competition for component suppliers. The Offeror will provide a list of those proprietary

7 Software Architecture and Quality Attributes


The Software Architecture and Quality Attributes section of this document provides examples of
RFP language that support visibility into contractor activities related to structural aspects of a
particular system. These structural issues are design-relatedâ€”software architecture is, after all, a
form of software design that occurs earliest in a systemâ€™s creationâ€”but at a more abstract level
than algorithms and data structures. According to what has come to be regarded as a seminal
paper on software architecture, Mary Shaw and David Garlan suggest that these â€•structural issues
include gross organization and global control structure; protocols for communication,
synchronization, and data access; assignment of functionality to design elements; physical
distribution; composition of design elements; scaling and performance; and selection among
design alternatives [Clements 1996].â€–

                                GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

 The RFP must request sufficient software schedule information to understand how the software
 development fits into the submitted IMS. This problem can be overcome by specifying
 supplemental information in the RFP to be submitted with the proposal such as [SMC 2004]

        IMS supplements to detail the lower level tasks to CSCI and incremental delivery
        mapping information showing where each CSCI is addressed in the IMS

 The technical definitions of the computer software architecture and data metamodel, estimated
 sizing, throughput timing, and growth migration strategy also need to be defined as criteria in
 Section L of the RFP and in the offerorâ€™s proposal [SMC 2004].

7.4     Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA)

7.4.1    Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
      The Offeror shall use modular open systems approach to [OSJTF]:
      1. Facilitate development of a modular architecture and allow for affordable
         intraoperability
      2. Ensure that the system design is sufficiently flexible and robust to accommodate
         changing technology and requirements
      3. Facilitate integration with other systems and use of commercial products from multiple
         sources both in the initial design and in future enhancements
      4. Enable technology insertion as currently available commercial products mature and
         new commercial products become available in the future
      5. Allow for affordable support
      6. Allow continued access to technologies and products supported by many suppliers (a
         broad industrial base which does not restrict available sources to the detriment of
         competition) [OSJTF]

EXAMPLE 2
      The Offeror shall use a modular open systems approach (MOSA) to evaluate the
      appropriateness of implementing a modular design strategy for building systems. A primary
      consideration in selection of equipment to meet the design functionality shall be the impact
      to the overall modular open systems architecture. A modular open systems approach and
      analysis of long term supportability, interoperability, and growth for future modifications
      shall be major factors in the Offerorâ€˜s final selection of equipment and integration
      approach. All the systems components shall facilitate future upgrades and permit
      incremental technology insertion to allow for incorporation of additional or higher
      performance elements with minimal impact on the existing systems [OSJTF].
      The architectural approach shall provide a viable technology insertion methodology and
      refresh strategy that supports application of a modular open systems approach and is
      responsive to changes driven by mission requirements and new technologies [OSJTF].

      The Offeror shall develop a detailed modular design and integration that includes but is not
      limited to the following aspects: interoperability, intra-operability, upgradeability,
      reconfigurability, transportability, software standards, interface standards, long term
      supportability, sources of supply and/or repair, business strategies, and other entities that
      affect application of a modular open systems approach [OSJTF].

      For those portions of hardware, firmware, or software that are driven to proprietary and/or
      closed system architectures by mission specific requirements, a hardware/firmware/software
      partitioning or other design features to mitigate the system level impacts shall be provided
      The Offeror shall provide an orderly, planned approach to address migration of proprietary
      or closed system equipment or interfaces to a modular design when technological advances
      are available [OSJTF].


157 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     The Offerorâ€˜s modular design and integration shall preclude long term dependence on
     closed or proprietary interface standards, technologies, products, or architectures. Secure
     or classified data systems shall also conform to the modular design approach as much as
     practical. The design shall provide sufficient growth and open interface standards to allow
     future reconfiguration and addition of new capabilities without large-scale redesign of the
     system [OSJTF].

EXAMPLE 3
     The Government intends to procure system(s) having an Open System Architecture and
     corresponding components. As part of this contract, the Contractor will be required to
     define, document, and follow an open systems approach for using modular design,
     standards-based interfaces, and widely-supported consensus-based standards. The
     Contractor shall develop, maintain, and use an open system management plan to support
     this approach and will be required to demonstrate compliance with that plan during all
     design reviews. As part of an open system management plan, the Contractor will be required
     to identify to the Government all Commercial-Off-the-Shelf/Nondevelopment Item
     (Commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS)/NDI) components, their functionality and
     proposed use in the system, and provide copies of license agreements related to the use of
     these components for Government approval prior to use. The proposed open system
     management plan will be incorporated into the contract with any changes, alterations,
     and/or modifications requiring Government approval. In addition, the Contractor shall
     provide the Government (and/or Government support contractors) electronic access to its
     integrated development environment throughout the term of the contract. In satisfying the
     Governmentâ€˜s requirements, the following system architecture approach characteristics
     shall be utilized [USN 2007a]:
     a. Open Architecture - The Contractor shall develop and maintain an architecture that
        incorporates appropriate considerations for reconfigurability, portability,
        maintainability, technology insertion, vendor independence, reusability, scalability,
        interoperability, upgradeability, and long-term supportability as required by the 23
        DEC 2005 Office of the Chief of XXX Operations ) requirements letter [USN 2007a].
     b. Modular Open Design â€“ The Contractor shall develop an architecture that is layered
        and modular and uses Commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS)/NDI hardware,
        operating systems, and middleware that utilize non-proprietary or non-vendor-unique,
        key Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The Contractorâ€˜s design approach
        shall be applied to all subsystems and components. As part of its open system
        management plan, the Contractor will be required, at a minimum, to describe how the
        proposed system architecture meets these goals, including the steps taken to use non-
        proprietary or non-vendor unique Commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) or
        reusable NDI components wherever practicable [USN 2007a].
         â€¢    Module Coupling - The Contractorâ€˜s design approach shall result in modules that
              have minimal dependencies on other modules (low coupling), as evidenced by
              simple, well-defined interfaces and by the absence of implicit data sharing. The
              purpose is to ensure that any changes to one module will not necessitate extensive
              changes to other modules, and hence facilitate module replacement and system
              enhancement. The approach used to determine the level of coupling and the design
              trade-off approach shall be described [USN 2007a].
         â€¢    Module Cohesion â€“ The Contractorâ€˜s design approach shall result in modules that
              are characterized by the singular assignment of identifiable, discrete functionality

158 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
               (high cohesion). The purpose is to ensure that any changes to system behavioral
               requirements can be accomplished by changing a minimum number of modules
               within the system. The approach used to determine the level of cohesion and the
               design trade-off approach shall be described [USN 2007a].

              commonality, etc.).
         2.3. Appropriate designation of open standards for key system interfaces.
3. Open Standards Indicators [OSJTF] Feasibility studies to assess the use of open standards
          for key interfaces.
         3.2. Application of a standards selection process that gives preference to open standards.
         3.3. Standards selection for key interfaces is based on application of specific criteria
              (e.g., DoD mandate, industry consensus, market support, prime contractor
              recommendation, etc.).
     Additionally, does the Offerorâ€˜s proposal provide the User with the ability to:
     â€¢     quickly interconnect, reconfigure, and assemble existing forces, systems, subsystems,
           and components?

     â€¢     support reuse of software and the common use of components across various product
           lines?

     systems approach for using modular design, standards-based interfaces, and widely
     supported, consensus-based standards to achieve the following goals. At a minimum the
     Offeror shall provide the following as part of its proposal [USN 2007a]:
     a. Address XXX Open Architecture Requirements â€“ A detailed description of the Offerorâ€˜s
        approach for addressing a system architecture that incorporates appropriate
        considerations for reconfigurability, portability, maintainability, technology insertion,
        vendor independence, reusability, scalability, interoperability, upgradeability, and long-
        term supportability . . . ..
     b.    Design Disclosure â€“ Within the constraints of contractual data rights, a detailed
          description of the Offerorâ€˜s approach to facilitate the sharing of system or component
          (e.g., software, hardware, middleware) design information in support of peer reviews
          and the spiral development process. The Offeror shall describe how its design will be
          documented and modeled using industry standard formats (e.g., Unified Modeling
          Language), and how it will use tools that are capable of exporting model information in
          a standard format (e.g., Extensible Markup Language Metadata Interchange (XMI) and
          AP233/ISO 10303). The Offeror shall identify the proposed standards and formats to be
          used.
     c.    Technology Insertion and Refresh â€“ A detailed description of how the Offerorâ€˜s
          proposed system will allow for rapid and affordable technology insertion and refresh.
          For example, the Offeror should describe how the proposed system will allow
          incremental systems improvement through upgrades of individual hardware or software
          modules with newer modular components. At a minimum, the description shall address
          how the Offerorâ€˜s architectural approach will support this requirement including how

              i.    Plans for integrating the systems both internally and with external systems;
             ii.    The means for ensuring conformance to open standards and profiles, as
                    discussed in Section C, throughout the development process;
            iii.    A description of how the technical approach ensures having access to mature
                    as well as the latest technologies by establishing a robust, modular, and
                    evolving architecture based on open standards.
             iv.    A description of the strategy for maintaining the currency of technology (e.g.,
                    through Commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) or reusable NDI insertion,
                    technology refresh strategies, and other appropriate means); and
             v.     Identification of processes for:
                      (1)    Isolating functionality through the use of modular design;
                      (2)    Evaluating modular open system baseline standards, defining and
                             updating profiles, and evaluating and justifying new or vendor-unique
                             profiles;
                      (3)    Validating implementation conformance to selected profiles;
                      (4)    Managing application conformance to selected profiles; and
                      (5)    Training in use of profiles.

             ii.     Enhance interoperability and the ability to integrate new capabilities without
                    redesign of entire systems or large portions thereof;
            iii.     Accelerate transition from science and technology into acquisition and
                    deployment;
             iv.     Facilitate systems reconfiguration and integration;

             vi.     Maintain continued access to cutting edge technologies and products from
                    multiple suppliers; and
            vii.     Mitigate the risks associated with reliance on a single source of supply over
                    the life of the system, to include, but be not limited to, technology obsolescence
                    and dependence on proprietary or vendor-unique technology.
     g.    Life-cycle Supportability â€“ A detailed description of how the Offeror intends to enhance
          life-cycle supportability by implementing performance-based logistics arrangements to
          sustain the components through their lifecycle.
     h.    Employ a Layered Modular Architecture â€“ A detailed description on how the proposed
          system architecture is layered, modular, and makes maximum use of Commercial-Off-
          the-Shelf/Non-developmental Item (Commercial off-the-shelf software
          (COTS)/NDI)hardware, operating systems, and middleware that utilize non-proprietary
          key APIs whenever practicable.
     i.    Traceability of System Requirements â€“ A detailed description of the Offerorâ€˜s approach
          for ensuring that all system requirements (including those contained in the Initial
          Capabilities Document, Capabilities Development Document, and in Section C of this
          Solicitation) are accounted for through a demonstrated ability to trace each requirement
          to one or more modules. Modules consist of components (one of the parts that make up a


162 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
          system and may be hardware and/or software) which are self-contained elements with
          well-defined, standards-based and published interfaces
     j.    Minimize Inter-component Dependencies â€“ A detailed description of the Offerorâ€˜s
          approach for designing a system that, to the maximum extent practicable, minimizes
          inter-component dependencies and allows components to be decoupled and re-used,
          where appropriate, across various Naval programs or replaced by competitive
          alternatives.
     k.   Rationale for Modularization Choices â€“ A detailed description of the Offerorâ€˜s rationale
          for the modularization choices made to generate the design. At a minimum, the rationale
          shall explicitly address any tradeoffs performed, particularly those that compromise the
          modular and open nature of the system.
     l.    Future System Upgrades â€“ A detailed description of how a modular design strategy will
          be demonstrated in all aspects of future system upgrades.
              i.     In addressing the specified requirements, the proposal, at a minimum, must
                    demonstrate how the modular design strategy applies, and the effect it will
                    have on future systems upgrades.
             ii.     The proposal shall describe an orderly planned process to address migration
                    of proprietary, vendor-unique, or closed system equipment or interfaces to a
                    modular open systems design when technological advances are available or
                    when operational capability is upgraded. The proprietary, vendor-unique or
                    closed systems implementation shall also be reflected in the Offerorâ€˜s system
                    level life cycle cost estimates.
            iii.     The modular design approach shall either mitigate or partition â€“ at the lowest
                    subsystem or component level â€” proprietary, vendor unique or closed system
                    implementation to avoid out-year supportability issues and diminished
                    manufacturing and repair sources.

7.5     Modular Open Systems Design

7.5.1    Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
      The Contractorâ€˜s design approach shall result in a layered system design, maximizing
      software independence from the hardware, thereby facilitating technology refresh. The
      design shall be optimized at the lowest component level to minimize inter-component
      dependencies. The layered design shall also isolate the application software layers from the
      infrastructure software (such as the operating system) to enhance portability and to facilitate
      technology refresh. The design shall be able to survive a change to the computing
      infrastructure with minimal or no changes required to the application logic. The interfaces
      between the layers shall be built to open standards or available to the Government with at
      least GPR rights. The system architecture shall minimize inter-component dependencies to
      allow components to be decoupled and re-used, where appropriate, across various XXX
      programs and platforms [USN 2007a].
      The Contractor shall describe its rationale for the modularization choices made to generate
      the design. The Contractorâ€˜s design approach shall produce a system that consists of
      hierarchical collections of software and hardware configuration items (components). These
      components shall be of a size that supports competitive acquisition as well as reuse. The
      Contractorâ€˜s design approach shall emphasize the selection of components that are
      available commercially or within the DOD, to avoid the need to redevelop products that
      already exist and that can be re-used. The Contractorâ€˜s rationale must explicitly address any
      tradeoffs performed, particularly those that compromise the modular and open nature of the
      system. MOSA Objectives â€“ The Contractor shall specify how it plans to use MOSA to enable
      the system to adapt to evolving requirements and threats; accelerate transition from science
      and technology into technology and deployment; facilitate systems reconfiguration and
      integration; reduce the development cycle time and total life cycle cost; maintain continued
      access to cutting edge technologies and products from multiple suppliers; and mitigate the
      risks associated with technology obsolescence, being locked into proprietary or vendor-
      unique technology, and reliance on a single source of supply over the life of the system
      [USN 2007a].

      The Offeror shall describe and demonstrate the strategy for reducing product or system and
      associated supportability costs through insertion of Commercial off-the-shelf software
      (COTS) or reusable NDI products [USN 2007a].
      a. The Offeror shall identify and demonstrate a strategy to insert Commercial off-the-shelf
         software (COTS) technologies and other reusable NDI into the system and demonstrate
         that Commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS), other reusable NDI, and other

7.8     Quality Attribute Requirements

7.8.1    Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
      Software Quality requirements will be specified for the program. The development of these
      requirements shall be the responsibility of the program office. The program office will work
      together with the end-user of the system to generate requirements based on an analysis of the
      system requirements, life expectancy, development costs and user concerns. Example user
      concerns to consider are performance (e.g. reliability, usability and efficiency), design
      architecture (e.g. maintainability and correctness) and re-engineering (e.g. reusability,
      interoperability and portability) [USAF 1996].
      Software Quality requirements will be specified and documented within the baselined
      Software Requirements Specification (SRS). A hierarchical quality model of quality factors,
      criteria and metrics will be used to predict software quality. Factors representing the userâ€˜s
      concerns will be decomposed (using relevant standards and guidebooks) into software
      oriented characteristics. Metrics/measures of these characteristics will also be defined. The
      specified model will apply to all software development phases and products. Quality
      progress will be reported and reviewed at each major program milestone [USAF 1996].
      All open and closed software quality problems will be tracked and reported. The
      achievement of software quality requirements will be demonstrated, using industry accepted
      Metrics/measures of operational quality (e.g. reliability = mean-time-to-failure), during
      integration testing. Failures will be categorized according to a Government approved
      severity standard [USAF 1996].

7.9      Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM)

7.9.1      Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements


                                  GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
 A Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) rationale is the information that becomes
 the basis for developing RAM-related portions of the request for proposal and contract(s) to
 design, develop, test, produce, deploy, and operate the capability. The RAM rationale also
 supports: tradeoff studies to balance cost and performance; development test planning and
 evaluation; and operational test and evaluation [DOD 2005].

 The RAM rationale expresses quantitative metrics/measures of the levels of reliability,
 availability, and maintainability needed by the user in operational terms; as well as
 corresponding quantitative metrics/measures in contractual terms for use in the RFP and contract
 [DOD 2005].

 The core elements of the RAM rationale are [DOD 2005]

        quantitative metrics/measures of the levels of reliability, availability and maintainability
        needed by the user, in operational terms, as well as corresponding quantitative measures in
        contractual terms for use in the RFP and contract [DOD 2005]
        an operational mode summary and mission profile, which quantifies how and in what
        environments the capability, will be used throughout the life cycle [DOD 2005]
        the hardware and software failure definitions and scoring criteria for assessing mission
        failures and logistics failures during modeling, simulation, test and other activities used for
        estimating, verifying, or predicting levels of RAM [DOD 2005]

 The RAM rationale also [DOD 2005]

        explains why the RAM levels are needed and how they interact and relate to other aspects of
        the capability (such as performance, force structure, affordability, concept/plan, logistics
        footprint); and, logistics footprint); and
        documents RAM performance of current capability to provide the basis for assessing
        measurable improvements to mission capability and operational support [DOD 2005]

 R&M requirements included in solicitations should include quantified R&M requirements and
 allowable uncertainties (such as statistical risks) the FD/SC (provides reliability failure
 definitions and thresholds of functioning for assessing failures); and the OMS/MP (provides life-
 cycle usage operation and conditions). Solicitations should require access to information
 adequate for evaluating the source data, models and reasonableness of modeling assumptions,
 methods, results, and risks and uncertainties. Requirements to use particular models or statistical
 test plans are not to be specified. Solicitations should not cite any language, specification,
 standard, or handbook that specifies â€•how to â€•design, manufacture, or test for reliability.



169 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
 MILâ€“HDBKâ€“217 or any of its derivatives are not to appear in a solicitation; it has been shown to
 be unreliable, and its use can lead to erroneous and misleading reliability predictions
 [Army 2003a].

 Develop an RFP that addresses all aspects of system performance. The RFP should clearly
 identify all constraints, assumptions, and definitions needed for the contractors to put the RAM
 situation in context, derive the inherent levels of RAM (those that are determined by design and
 manufacturing), determine the best approach for achieving satisfactory RAM, and state the
 operational RAM requirements (e.g., operational availability) [DOD 2005].

 Translate the operational RAM terms into suitable RFP and contractual terms for the material
 development contractor to pursue. Develop the mission and logistics reliability specification
 requirements and the maintainability and integrated diagnostics specification requirements.
 These and associated RAM program and acceptance test requirements become part of the RFP
 and contract. Specification development requires conversion of the operational RAM parameters
 to an equivalent contractual measurement. This process has been recognized as a weak link
 [DOD 2005].

7.9.2      Section M - Evaluation


                                  GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

 RFP responses should be evaluated, in part, on the basis of a reliability, availability, and
 maintainability (RAM) program plan (RAMPP) as follows [DOD 2005]:

 Understanding [DOD 2005]

 The plan should show a clear understanding of

        importance of designing in reliability, availability, and maintainability
        RAM techniques, methodology, and concepts
        importance of integrating RAM activities into the overall systems engineering process

 Approach [DOD 2005]

        Management. The plan should identify
             who is responsible for RAM and their experience and qualifications
             the number of RAM personnel assigned to the program, the experience level of the
             RAM personnel, and the number of labor hours allocated to RAM activities
             how RAM personnel fit in the organizational framework of the program
             an effective means of communication and sharing of information among RAM
             engineers and analysts, design engineers, manufacturing engineers, and higher
             management
             the contractorâ€™s system for controlling the RAM of items from subcontractors and vendors


170 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
           how the contractor implements concurrent engineering practices and integrates RAM
           into the overall engineering and manufacturing effort

     Design. The plan should explain
           if and how design standards; guidelines; and criteria such as part derating, thermal
           design, modular construction, Environmental Stress Screening (ESS), and testability
           will be used
           the contractorâ€™s system for tracking failures and the actions taken to correct (i.e.,
           eliminate or reduce the effect of) the failures. If and how a parts control program will
           be implemented and the approval procedures for non-standard parts
           if and how tradeoff studies will be used for critical design areas
           the time-phasing of RAM activities in relation to key program milestones.
           any areas of RAM risk
           if and how software reliability will be addressed

     Analysis/Test. The plan should identify and describe
           methods of analysis and math models to be used
           RAM modeling, prediction, and allocation procedures
           the time phasing and dependencies of the RAM and other testing in relation to the
           overall program schedule
           the time available for the test type required (such as maximum time for sequential test)
           and how that time was determined
           how the ESS program (if one is planned) is consistent with the requirements in terms of
           methodology and scheduling
           if the contractor will predict the RAM (in whatever parameters are specified) prior to
           the start of testing

7.9.3      Section L - Instructions to Offerors


                                 GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

The RFP should normally require a preliminary reliability, availability, and maintainability
(RAM) program plan (RAMPP) be developed as part of the systems engineering plan (SEP). The
SEP should identify the RAM engineering techniques that will be applied to develop system or
elemental RAM performance. The requirements for RAM demonstration, as appropriate, should
be identified in the specification and relevant verification matrix, and normally outlined in the
contractorâ€™s preliminary test and evaluation plan (TEP) [DOD 2005].

EXAMPLE 1
     An automated, computer-based software life cycle development and support environment
     will be used by the contractor. Development of the environmentâ€˜s requirements shall be the
     responsibility of the program office. The ability of the environmentâ€˜s hardware/software
     complex (including each of its associated CASE tools) to adequately and efficiently support
     the breadth of software under development (i.e., scalability to the size of the problem) will be

Proposal Requirement #1: Software Architecture [USAF 2005]

     The proposal requirement will be met when the Offeror proposes an effective software
     architecture that:
        Is developed with Modular Open System Approach principles. Supports the development
        of software items that are highly modular and independent of non-developmental
        hardware and software items.
        Implements the proposed architecture for TNOM and supports the TSAT system
        information assurance architecture.
        Supports system evolution and integration through open and well-defined component
        interface standards.
        Provides a flexible design that accommodates requirement changes with minimal impact
        to the TNOM software architecture.
        Is compatible with legacy systems and subsumes the AEHF planning function.

7.11.3 Section L - Instructions to Offerors

EXAMPLE 1

Proposal Requirement #X: Software Architecture [USAF 2005]

     Describe your proposed software architecture in Attachment MC9 in your chosen
     architectural representation technique consistent with the Software Architecture Format
     described in Attachment 8. Include diagrams indicating the components/subcomponents and
     their interfaces, with descriptions of the data used by each component and the functionality
     of the components. The architecture representation in the proposal shall model

     replacement. Explain how your software architecture supports the DoD Modular Open
     Systems Approach.
     Explain how the proposed software architecture implements the TMOS requirements
     (including IA and AEHF planning) and how the architecture interfaces are compatible with
     existing legacy systems.

     capability through full functionality. Describe architecture considerations needed to enable
     additional requirements.
     Provide results of high-level performance analysis that explains key aspects of the proposed
     software architecture. The analysis must show how the proposed architecture, sizing
     estimates, and design demonstrate understanding of functional and interface requirements,
     components, COTS/NDI, necessary data flow, and risks. This should include a mapping of
     ELOC/COTS to each requirement (or set of requirements).

     Describe the proposed process for developing, documenting, and maintaining your TMOS
     software architecture (reference DI-MISC-80508/T). The process description shall explain:
     (1) how the architecture will be maintained during system development, implementation, and
     sustainment; (2) how the system compliance to the architecture will be established and
     maintained (for example by using mappings from architecture representation model to

EXAMPLE 1
     Results of the engineering efforts during the development of the software architecture,
     including all evaluations, will be documented, including rationale for both design decisions
     and changes to the baselined architecture. Documentation will support the architecture
     evaluation method and the tracking of changes to the baselined software architecture.
     Specific information must include, but not limited to, module structure, component
     interfaces, process structure, and data-flow structure. In each structure, the view-specific
     relationships among the entities must be documented. For the module structure, relationship
     information includes but is not limited to the unique information that is encapsulated in each
     module. For the process structure, the relationship information includes but is not limited to
     synchronization and concurrency relationships. For the data-flow structure, relationship
     information includes but is not limited to a high-level description of the data that is

7.14 Software Architecture Evaluation

7.14.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
     An evaluation team shall conduct a series of software architecture evaluations in
     accordance with the special requirements of Section H [Bergey 2005].

EXAMPLE 2
     The contractor will development and document scenarios required to conduct architecture
     evaluation using the method described in Appendix YY for [Fisher 2008]:
     â€¢   Evaluation of the software architecture prior to the first incremental system build
     â€¢   Evaluation of the system prior to acceptance
     Scenarios are developed to exercise specified system change scenarios that are specified in
     the system specification. These will reflect the non-functional quality attributes of interest.
     These scenarios will also present interactions from different roles, such as end-user, system
     administrator, maintainer, and developer. (this task should be undertaken by a domain
     expert. These scenarios should reflect all roles relevant to the system.) [Fisher 2008]
     Following the design of these scenarios, the contractor and the Government will conduct a
     technical interchange meeting, assessing the scenarios to determine that these are sufficient
     to demonstrate that the software satisfies the contractual requirements [Fisher 2008].

EXAMPLE 3
     After resolution of issues identified during the evaluation readiness review (see Software
     Architecture Evaluation Readiness Review), and prior to full implementation of the system,
     the contractor will plan and jointly conduct with the Government evaluations against the
     contractual requirements using the architecture evaluation method and contractor-
     generated scenarios. The contractor will develop an evaluation agenda (plan) to the
     Governmentâ€˜s satisfaction [Fisher 2008].
     Weaknesses or deficiencies in the software architecture found during these evaluations will
     be entered into the contractorâ€˜s corrective action system and resolved by the contractor
     prior to implementation of incremental systems builds [Fisher 2008].




178 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
                                   GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

        If a software architecture evaluation is to be required, both the SOW and the product
        requirements must specify the particular method (such as the Architectural Trade-Off
        Analysis Method) as well as how the software architecture evaluation method will be
        used and implemented in the acquisition. This information must be integrated and
        compatible with other acquisition requirements that are part of the RFP [Bergey 2002].

        The statement of work (SOW) describes what the supplier must accomplish. In terms of
        any evaluation method, the SOW describes which evaluation steps are the supplierâ€™s
        responsibilities. The software architecture evaluation steps in the SOW must be
        consistent with the overall acquisition. In addition, the SOW should indicate if certain
        evaluation steps are to be performed jointly by the acquirer and the potential system
        supplier [Bergey 2002].



7.14.2 Section M - Evaluation

EXAMPLE 1
     To incorporate architecture evaluation, Section M must specify how the architecture
     evaluation will relate to the factors and subfactors. And, it must specify the criteria to be
     used in judging the bidder's approach to satisfying the RFP/contract architecture
     requirements [SEI SASS].
     It is important to emphasize that all RFP sections must be consistent with each other. For
     example, Section M must include the specific criteria to evaluate only those RFP responses
     that correspond to the requested areas identified in Section L [SEI SASS].

EXAMPLE 2
     1. Basis For Award
         The award of the <SYSTEM NAME> contract will be based upon the offer that provides
         the best overall value to the Government in terms of technical, prices, [and]
         performance risk. All proposals will be evaluated in terms of the factors and subfactors
         in accordance with the criteria set forth below. Award may not necessarily be made to
         the offeror with the lowest evaluated price [Bergey 2002].
     2. Factors And Subfactors To Be Evaluated [Bergey 2002]
         The following factors and subfactors will be evaluated [Bergey 2002].




179 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
             FACTOR:              Technical
                                      Subfactors:
                                               Hardware
                                               Software architecture
                                               Software
             FACTOR:              Price
             FACTOR:              Performance Risk
             FACTOR:              Management
     The following criteria will be applied to measure the quality of the proposed approach under
     the Technical, and Performance Risk factors and their respective subfactors, as indicated in
     Paragraph 5 below [Bergey 2002].
     4.1 Adequacy of Response
     Adequacy of response is defined as the extent to which the proposed approach is complete
     and demonstrates an understanding of the requirements [Bergey 2002].
     Completeness is defined as the extent to which: the proposal describes approaches,
     including proposed solutions, that address all requirements of the acquisition as requested in
     the RFP, Section L, and associated risks; means for resolution of the risks have been
     provided; and the approaches are discussed with sufficient, substantive information to
     convey to the evaluator a clear and accurate description of how the requirements are to be
     satisfied [Bergey 2002].
     Understanding of requirements is the extent to which the approach, including proposed
     solutions, demonstrates an accurate comprehension of the specified requirements, the
     intended mission environment, and program goals [Bergey 2002].
     4. 2 Feasibility
     Feasibility is defined as the extent to which the approach, including proposed solutions, is
     capable of satisfying requirements and is realistically achievable, including the extent to
     which all risks associated with the approach have been mitigated for successful achievement
     of the requirements [Bergey 2002].
     4.3 Flexibility
     Flexibility is the extent to which the approach is adaptable to changing needs or
     requirements, including future growth. For evaluation of software architecture, flexibility is
     further defined in terms of modifiability, security, and reusability, which are defined as
     [Bergey 2002]:
        Modifiability. The extent to which the system can be changed quickly and cost effectively
        Reliability. A measure of the proportion of time the system is up and running.
        Security. A measure of the systemâ€˜s ability to resist unauthorized attempts at usage and
        denial of service, while still providing its services to legitimate users.




180 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     4.4 Performance Risk Assurance
     Performance Risk Assurance (PRA) is defined as the Governmentâ€˜s level of confidence that
     the offeror (including each subcontractor/team member) will meet technical, delivery,
     quality, and small disadvantaged business subcontracting objectives of the <SYSTEM
     NAME> contract, based upon the degree that the offeror (including each subcontractor/
     team member) has met these same objectives for similar and related efforts, and based upon
     the feasibility of his proposed management and technical approaches for the <SYSTEM
     NAME > contract [Bergey 2002].
     4.5 Source Selection Demonstration
     Results of the Source Selection Demonstration will be used to verify the feasibility and
     flexibility of the proposed approaches and claimed capabilities to satisfy the <SYSTEM
     NAME> requirements, including the offerorâ€˜s capability to design and evaluate software
     architectures, and the offerorâ€˜s understanding of the requirements [Bergey 2002].

EXAMPLE 4
     Modifiability â€“ the extent to which the system can be changed quickly and cost effectively
     [Fisher 2008].
     Portability â€“ the extent of the systemâ€˜s ability to run under different computing environments
     [Fisher 2008].
     Reusability â€“ the extent to which the structure of the system or some of its components can be
     reused in future applications [Fisher 2008].

EXAMPLE 5
     Results of the pre-award demonstration will be used to verify the feasibility and flexibility of
     the proposed approaches and claimed capabilities to satisfy the requirements; and, the
     offerorâ€˜s understanding of the requirements, including the methods of evolution of the
     software architecture [Fisher 2008].

     This Volume shall contain a full discussion of how the offer and proposed approach intends
     to satisfy requirements identified in the respective paragraphs of the RFP [Bergey 2002].
     Software Architecture
     For each paragraph associated with the software architecture in the Statement of Work
     (SOW), the offeror shall describe the proposed software architecture, the approach to the
     development and evaluation of the final software architecture and how this approach will
     result in a software architecture to meet the RFP requirements [Bergey 2002].
     VOLUME 4 - PERFORMANCE RISK
     Volume 4 shall contain a full discussion of how the offeror intends to satisfy the RFP
     requirements indicated below.

        Schedule
        Facilities
     The contents of these Sections are defined as follows [Bergey 2002]:
     4.1 Past Performance [Bergey 2002]
     Describe work performed on software projects similar in scope to the requirements for
     <SYSTEM NAME>, to include design methodology, software architecture design, software
     architecture evaluation, software integration, integration of NDI software, utilization of
     industry standards for developing and integrating software (e.g., open system architecture),
     software security, computer aided software engineering (CASE) tools, and original
     estimated lines of code versus actual lines of code at completion [Bergey 2002].
     Discuss concurrent engineering approaches, including software architecture development
     and evaluation that were used, including lessons learned, and resulting engineering,
     manufacturing, and equipment improvements that enhanced equipment and contract
     performance [Bergey 2002].
     In the event that the offeror/subcontractor(s) (if applicable) has not had applicable
     contracts, a summary of other experience with similar and/or related work over a like period
     of time shall be submitted with POCs for each customer [Bergey 2002].
     The Government may elect to verify all or some past performance data provided in the
     proposal by obtaining additional information outside of the written content of the proposal.
     In addition, the Government may consider relevant data extrinsic to the proposal which is
     otherwise available to the Government. In the event of an unresolved discrepancy, the
     Government-obtained data will take precedence [Bergey 2002].
     For the software architecture and software architecture evaluation portion of the
     demonstration, the offeror shall conduct an Architectural Trade-Off Analysis Method
     (ATAM) prior to submission of proposal following the evaluation steps described in the
     Attachment A: Architectural Trade-Off Analysis Method (ATAM) Evaluation Steps to this
     PPI. The offeror must use scenarios provided by the Government in the RFP as part of this
     ATAM [Bergey 2002].
     The offeror must designate a Demonstration Director who will be the sole responsible
     person to interface with the Government-appointed Demonstration Director/Leader during
     the conduct of the demonstration. The offerorâ€˜s designee must be identified prior to the
     demonstration and must be available during the entire demonstration [Bergey 2002].
     For the purposes of the demonstration, the requirements to be demonstrated are those stated
     in the system specification, including those requirements related to the software architecture
     and the software architecture evaluation [Bergey 2002].

     For conduct of the demonstration the offeror shall prepare the Source Selection
     Demonstration plans/procedures to be used in conducting the demonstration. The system
     capabilities will be demonstrated in the following order [Bergey 2002]:




182 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     Weeks one and two [Bergey 2002]:
     1. Software architecture
     2. <Other capability to be demonstrated>
     3. <Other capability to be demonstrated>
     Weeks three and four:
     1. <Other capability to be demonstrated>
     2. <Other capability to be demonstrated>
     To the extent that the software and associated software architecture to be demonstrated
     differs from that which is offered for delivery, the offeror must completely describe the
     differences in this volume. The offeror shall fully describe in this volume his approach to
     providing the proposed software and associated software architecture meeting the
     requirements of the demonstration [Bergey 2002].
     No demonstrations will be performed without procedures submitted as part of the proposal
     [Bergey 2002].

EXAMPLE 2
     The steps of the evaluation method are [Fisher 2008]:
     â€¢   Express the candidate architecture(s) in a common syntactic architectural notation and
         with a common granularity. (Typical views solicited include the process view, the
         module (logical) view, and a data flow view.)
     â€¢   For each scenario, determine whether the candidate architecture supports this task
         without modification (i.e., can the system carry out this scenario without human
         intervention or whether the candidate architecture needs to be modified in order to
         support the task
     â€¢   For each scenario executed and this execution indicating need for modification, the
         contractor will identify computational components affected by that scenario execution.
         (This requires in-depth knowledge of the architecture which would typically be provided
         by a complete set of specifications. Catalog the identified modification(s) from the
         following list:
         â€“    Change to data connection between components
         â€“    Change to control connection between components
         â€“    Change to internals of a component
         â€“    Introduction of new (or deletion of old) component
         â€“    Introduction of new (or deletion of old) data or control connections
     â€¢   For those scenarios executed that require modification(s) to the software architecture,
         the contractor will determine how many components within each architecture are
         affected by multiple, different in kind, scenarios. (This may identify a component that (a)
         has been designed to be responsible for too many differing concerns; or (b) needs to be
         further decomposed in the documentation for the evaluation exercise.)
     â€¢   For each scenario executed, modifications to the software and associated architecture
         are recorded on change requests which contain proposed modifications in all software
         documentation, e.g., requirements, design, and software architecture design rationale.
         These change requests form the basis for an estimate of the effort required to make the
         change(s).
183 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
     â€¢   For the change(s) for each scenario, the effort required in man-days to make the
         modifications is estimated. The effort must include all aspects of making the actual
         change, including requirements analysis, functional analysis, hardware/software
         requirements, modification to the documentation, further evaluations, planning the
         modifications, etc. Estimates of effort must be made with a validated estimation method
         agreed upon before initiation of the contract.
     â€¢   The contractor will conduct jointly with the Government a walkthrough of the software
         architecture and the proposed changes for each scenario executed. These walkthroughs
         will allow a mutual understanding of the proposed changes and further validate the
         effort estimates. Validated estimates are then compared to the contractual requirements,
         and weaknesses and deficiencies are identified.

EXAMPLE 1
     Following the completion of the software architecture design, the resolution of weakness and
     deficiencies, and prior to evaluation, the contractor will plan and jointly conduct with the
     Government an evaluation readiness review to determine that the software architecture
     design is sufficiently complete to enable evaluation and to identify any issues in the design
     [Fisher 2008].
     Weaknesses or deficiencies in the software architecture found during this review will be
     entered into the contractorâ€˜s corrective action system and resolved by the contractor to the

EXAMPLE 1
       The Government intends, through Pre-Award Demonstration , to verify the capabilities of
       the proposed hardware and software items and associated software architectures. Results of
       the Pre-Award Demonstration will be used to verify the feasibility and flexibility of the
       proposed approaches and claimed capabilities to satisfy the <SYSTEM NAME >
       requirements. The demonstrations must be sufficient to verify the proposed approaches and
       claimed capabilities. The offerors shall conduct demonstrations using existing
       hardware/software. It is not the Governmentâ€˜s intent to burden the offerors with development
       of <SYSTEM NAME > unique hardware/software for the purposes of this demonstration
       [Bergey 2002].
       Demonstrations will take place at the Government facilities at <LOCATION>. The
       demonstration is solely an offeror demonstration with Government representatives
       observing. The Government may query the offeror during the demonstration regarding the
       proposed capability being demonstrated or regarding the plans and procedures being
       performed [Bergey 2002].
       Volume XX of the proposal will contain the Pre-Award Demonstration plan and procedures,
       which will be used by the offeror during the conduct of the demonstration. The plan and
       procedures will be developed using as a guide for format and content <ACQUIRER'S
       STANDARD TEMPLATES> [Bergey 2002].
       The plan and procedures will address all demonstrations and their sequence, and specific
       schedules of events for each demonstration, as defined in this section of the RFP. The
       demonstration schedule shall be in a matrix format as shown by the EXAMPLE below.
       Offeror will not be allowed to conduct simultaneous demonstrations. The demonstration plan
       and procedures are considered part of the proposal and as such, the Government will assess
       the plan and procedures. The Government may forward comments to the offeror based upon
       such assessments. The plan and procedures submitted in this volume, as modified as a result
       of Government comments, will be the only ones used by the Government and the offeror
       during the demonstrations. Any deviations or changes to these plans and procedures will
       require the offeror during his scheduled demonstration period to review, in detail with
       Government observers, the reason for the deviation/change and explain how that
       deviation/change is necessary to verify the capability being demonstrated. This review shall
       be conducted prior to the demonstration involving the deviation/change [Bergey 2002].
       The offeror will be allotted four (3) weeks, for a total of 130 hours, in which to conduct and
       complete his demonstration of the system. The offeror may demonstrate other unique
       capabilities in addition to the â€•SOW Requirements to be Demonstratedâ€– within the allotted
       total time. The offeror shall allocate time for unique demonstrations and re-demonstrations
       within this time frame. However, re-demonstrations will be performed within the time frame
       for the specific equipment/software category given in this Section (see EXAMPLE schedule
       below). The hours of demonstration will be 0800-1130 and 1230-1600 Monday-Friday
       [Bergey 2002].

     Offeror must bring sufficient equipment and other material, e.g., documentation, to
     accomplish demonstrations, as well as spares in the event of equipment failures. Offerors are
     completely responsible for the physical control and maintenance of their equipment
     [Bergey 2002].
     The Government also intends to conduct an audit of all offeror equipment and software to be
     demonstrated or used in the demonstration. The offeror shall be allowed twelve (12) hours to
     set up all his equipment/software and to conduct the audit. It is planned that the set up and
     audit will commence at 0800 hours one day prior to the scheduled start date of the
     demonstrations, to allow maximum time for demonstrations. The set up and audit will be
     completed by 2000 hours on the day started. If additional time is needed by the offeror, it
     will be completed before the demonstrations are started and this additional time, if required,
     shall be subtracted from the offerorsâ€˜ allowed 130 hours for conducting all of the
     demonstrations [Bergey 2002].
     The Government will require the offeror to perform the audit under Government control and
     direction, including opening the hardware for Government inspection and identifying
     software. No changes or modification to the equipment or software will be allowed after the
     audit without Government approval. The Government reserves the right to revalidate the
     audit or conduct additional audits, as necessary, during the demonstration period
     [Bergey 2002].

7.17 Software Architecture Quality Requirements

7.17.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements


                                GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

 Section 1 of the RFP specifies system quality requirements from which software architecture
 requirements (runtime and non-runtime) are derived. They must be stated in terms of
 [SEI SASS]

     definition of system quality attributes
     specification of acceptable values
     definition of scenarios and test cases
     specification of other requirements (e.g., C4ISR)

 Section 2 of the system specification describes the software architecture evaluation methods,
 such as the Architectural Trade-Off Analysis Method (ATAM) or QAW, to determine if the
 software architecture can support the satisfaction of the requirements in Section 1 [SEI SASS].

 Section 1 of the System Specification should contain system quality requirements and their
 respective characterizations. Modifiability, reliability, and security are examples of the types of
 system quality attributes. If reliability is a required quality attribute, a characterization might be
 that â€•the system will not fail under maximum load.â€– [Bergey 2002].

 A system specification typically has two main sections of interest. Section 1 specifies functional
 and quality requirements for the system. Here, quality requirements refer to the quality attributes
 of the system and their respective characterizations. Modifiability, reliability, and security are
 examples of the types of system quality attributes that may be considered. For example, if
 reliability is a required quality attribute, a characterization might be that the system must meet a
 specific mean time between failure (MTBF) requirement. Eliciting the quality attributes of
 primary interest as well as their characterizations is part of the ATAM [Bergey 2002].

 Section 2 of the system specification describes the software architecture evaluation methods
 (such as the ATAM) that the supplier must use to evaluate the software architecture during the
 post-award phase of the acquisition. The evaluation results will be the basis for determining if
 the software architecture can support the satisfaction of the requirements in Section 1 of the
 system specification [Bergey 2002].

 Sometimes an acquisition organization will elect (or is required) to include a statement of
 objectives (SOO) in the RFP instead of a SOW. In these cases, the contract language that would
 traditionally be included in the SOW (to describe the requirements for software architecture
 evaluation) should be included under Section H (Special Contract Requirements) of the RFP
 [Bergey 2002].

8.7.1    Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
      The contractor shall ensure that any IT systems covered in this procurement or identified in
      this RFP/RFQ support the goals of the DoD Net-Centric Data Strategy dated May 9, 2003
      [DOD 2004b].
      Also, the contractor must ensure that any IT systems covered in this procurement or
      identified in this RFP/RFQ meet the requirements detailed below. Additionally, it is
      acceptable for vendors and/or integrators to provide functionality (via wrappers, interfaces,
      extensions) that tailor the Commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) system to enable these
      requirements below (i.e. the Commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) system need not be
      modified internally if the vendor/integrator enables the requirements through external or
      additional mechanisms. In this case, these mechanisms must be acquired along with the
      Commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) system procurement) [DOD 2004b].
      Access to Data. The contractor shall ensure that all data managed by the IT system can be
      made accessible to the widest possible audience of Global Information Grid (GIG) users via
      open, web-based standards. Additionally, the system's data should be accessible to GIG
      users without 1) the need for proprietary client-side software/hardware, or 2) the need for
      licensed user-access (e.g. non-licensed users should be able to access the system's data
      independent to the licensing model of the Commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) system).
      This includes all data that is used to perform mission-related analysis and processing
      including structured and unstructured sources of data such as databases, reports, and
      documents. It is not required that internal, maintenance data structures be accessible [DOD
      2004b].
      Metadata. The contractor shall ensure that all significant business data made accessible by
      the IT system is tagged with descriptive metadata to support the net-centric goal of data
      visibility. Accordingly, the system data shall be tagged to comply, at a minimum, with the
      DoD Discovery Metadata Specification (DDMS) . This specification is available at the DoD
      Metadata Registry found at http://diides.ncr.disa.mil/mdreg HomePage/mdregHome.portal.
      The system should provide DoD Discovery Metadata Specification (DDMS) compliant
      metadata at an appropriate level based on the type of data being tagged. It is not required
      that individual records within databases be tagged; rather it is expected that the database
      itself or some segment of it is tagged appropriately. Additionally, the contractor shall ensure
      that all structural and vocabulary metadata (metamodels, data dictionaries) associated with
      the exposed system data be made available in data formats and definitions. This includes
      proprietary metadata if it is required to effectively use the system data [DOD 2004b].
      Enterprise Services/Capabilities. The contractor shall ensure that key business logic
      processing and other functional capabilities contained within the IT system are exposed
      using web-based open standards (e.g. APIs provide for Web Services-based access to system
      processes and data). The level of business logic exposure shall be sufficient to enable
      reuse/extension within other applications and/or to build new capabilities. The contractor
      shall provide an assessment of how any licensing restrictions affect or do not affect meeting
      the goals of re-use and exposure as Global Information Grid (GIG)-wide enterprise services
      [DOD 2004b].

      This section provides criteria that will be used to evaluate the Offeror's proposed network
      architecture [USAF 2005].

Proposal Requirement #X: Initial TSAT Network Architecture

      The proposal requirement will be met when the Offeror provides an initial TSAT network
      architecture, analysis of shortfalls, and plan to evolve the initial architecture, resulting in a
      TSAT network architecture that:
      Forms a basis for meeting all threshold functional and performance requirements for the
      TSAT network as defined in the TSAT System TRD and is consistent with applicable sections
      of the DoD Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR), DoD CIO memoranda, the
      Network-Centric Operations and Warfare Reference model, Net-Ready KPP, and GIG
      Systems Engineering working group outputs.

      required information flows across the red/black interface at the edge of the GIG black core
      network consistent with the selected network architecture, including taking into account
      realistic considerations for government restrictions on information passing across such
      interfaces. The Offeror provides an approach to TSAT network architecture/design with

      Demonstrates an understanding of the TSAT network boundary and the implications for
      performance, security, and interoperability, by defining the boundaries, roles, and functions
      of network elements within the TSAT network and between the TSAT network and external
      network elements.
      Identifies sources and specific anticipated types of uncertainty and change in external
      networks, network standards, interfaces, and policies. The Offeror highlights specific
      network architecture features which accommodate such changes while minimizing the

Proposal Requirement #X: TSAT Network Management and Operations Architecture

     The proposal requirement will be met when the Offeror proposes an initial TMOS
     architecture, analysis of shortfalls, and plan to evolve the initial architecture, resulting in a
     TMOS architecture that:
     Forms a basis for meeting all threshold technical requirements for TNOM, TSAT Network
     Services element and TSAT GIG Border Element as defined in the TMOS TRD. The proposed
     architecture is consistent with applicable sections of the Joint Technical Architecture, DoD
     CIO memoranda, Network-Centric Operations and Warfare Reference Model, Net-Ready
     KPP, and GIG System Engineering products. The Government reserves the right to evaluate
     and give evaluation credit for proposed features that meet stated objective requirements of
     the TMOS TRD.
     Provides TSAT functionality to operate effectively with the AEHF system. The proposed
     architecture provides this functionality concurrent with all other TSAT functions.
     Provides for a seamless transition between TNOM planning and real-time, automated system
     operations, particularly in the delivery of quality of service. The Offeror effectively allocates
     functions to centralized and distributed components of the proposed architecture. The
     Offeror describes and justifies the use of all managed network and security components,
     including message guards, and explains the impact of such components on the
     responsiveness of TNOM activities. The Offeror describes an effective, responsive process by
     which contention for the use of TSAT resources is resolved in accordance with national and
     operational policies, in a timely fashion, and in a way that is responsive to mission needs.
     The Offeror also describes the integration of a flexible, extensible decision support system
     with network management and operations, including planning, and provides concrete

     The proposal requirement will be met when the Offeror provides an effective top-level design
     for TNOM and TSAT Network Services, including all functional areas and a specification
     tree that shows the flow down to Element and subsystem specifications. The Offeror provides
     a design that:
        Meets technical requirements in a manner that is consistent with the proposed TNOM
        architecture, robust to varying demand and patterns of usage, and accommodating of
        changes over time. The design description provides credible and appropriate supporting
        data, technical rationale, and a maturity assessment of system components, including the
        identification and characterization of those components identified by the Offeror as
        design drivers as well as justification for the selection of the design drivers.
        Implements highly capable dynamic mission planning, resource control, monitoring, and
        device configuration for the TSAT network. The TNOM design supports all TSAT network
        services across the full range of pre-planned and ad-hoc mission scenarios for fixed and
        mobile terminals on terrestrial, airborne, maritime, and space-based platforms. The
        Offeror identifies capabilities and constraints of the TSAT network, including both the
        initial network design and the TSAT concept of operations that impact the design of
        TNOM and TSAT Network Services. The Offeror also addresses the use of precedence
        and priority levels throughout the resource allocation lifecycle, including the number of
        such levels and interactions among these attributes. The Offeror's TNOM architecture
        supports an approach to MLPP that is consistent with national requirements. The
        proposed design supports the migration of Satellite Database (SDB) â€—requirementsâ€˜ from
        circuit-switched to a mix of circuit-switched and packet-switched services. The Offeror
        provides realistic expectations and sound engineering justification for robust
        performance under a variety of packet and circuit mixes and loading levels.
        Applies policy-based management and control mechanisms across the TNOM
        architecture, including planning, resource allocation, and network operations for

        increase the effectiveness of the proposed design. The Offeror also assesses the impact of
        these mechanisms on the complexity of the system, especially in relation to the human-
        machine interface and the role of the human operators.
        Includes a top-level design for TGBE. The design should scale to meet performance
        objectives under maximum load as defined in the 1-4-2-1 and other Government
        furnished scenarios. It should accommodate uncertainties and changes in external
        elements, standards, interfaces, and policies. The TGBE design is shown to accommodate
        a robust range of mixes of circuit and packet data at up to full uplink/downlink data
        rates.
        Includes engineering analysis regarding the shortfalls of the initial TNOM design and

211 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
        The Offeror provides information exchange requirements (IERs) for each TMOS
        interface that will maximize the quality, responsiveness, and reliability of TSAT network
        services, support mission planning and replanning in conformance with policy, enable
        best practices for network management, and ensure the TSAT network meets SLA
        commitments. IERs should include both TSAT-internal and external interfaces. The
        Offeror specifies the information content of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to be
        established with peer and customer networks. The Offeror defines these agreements in
        quantitative terms, characterizes the precision and accuracy of SLA contents, and
        demonstrates how the SLA content supports the TSAT CONOPS and helps to ensure the
        reliable, predictable delivery of service to the TSAT user.
        Describes functions and procedures of the proposed TNOM design that are invoked in
        the inter-domain planning and management of the TSAT network and demonstrates the
        value of these functions and procedures to the TSAT and TMOS system
        goals/requirements. The Offeror identifies interactions along mission timelines between
        TNOM and the planning and management systems of peer and user networks. The
        Offeror describes how IERs and SLAs are used by TNOM operators, TSAT users,
        operators of peer networks, mission planners, and GIG NETOPS centers.

        TMOS design proposed by the Offeror.
        Fully identifies and clearly describes the TSAT network services that are proposed to be
        delivered and managed by TMOS, including a realistic hardware and software
        implementation approach and plan for optimization. Examples of network services
        include DNS, IP address allocation/assignment/management, antenna/beam control, and
        key management. The Offeror provides justification for the selection of these services and
        explains how each service contributes to TSAT and TMOS mission success. The Offeror
        defines key remaining trades on network services which may have significant impact on
        network performance, reliability, or cost.

Proposal Requirement #X: Risk Identification/Mitigation

     The proposal requirement will be met when the Offeror identifies and analyzes the
     prioritized list of risks according to probability of occurrence and severity of consequence.
     The risk analysis adequately justifies these risks and includes isolation of causes and
     determination of effects. For associated risk-related activities, the Offeror identifies
     organizational responsibilities, provides risk burndown plans, and includes a realistic work
     schedule in the IMS and costs shown in the CWBS which are consistent with objectives for
     TSAT/TMOS milestones.

         [MIL-STD-QQQ].
     â€¢   Testabilityâ€”The contractor shall ensure that the software performance requirements are
         expressed in quantitative terms that can be directly translated into acceptance criteria
         [MIL-STD-QQQ].
     The Government shall have the option to conduct, or utilize a third party to conduct, an
     independent verification of the detailed software requirements to assess the satisfaction of
     the higher level requirements [MIL-STD-QQQ].
     The contractor shall conduct independent assessments of the software requirements
     development process to ensure that the detailed software requirements are being determined

8.14 Reuse

8.14.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
     As part of the Software Development Plan (SDP), reuse software engineering and planning
     shall be addressed. The Software Development Plan (SDP) shall contain a WBS that
     includes the establishment and implementation of a reuse program. Reuse shall be an
     integral part of the Software Development Plan (SDP) , review, audit and reporting. As part
     of the contractorâ€˜s SEE, a Software Reuse Library shall be established and maintained after
     appropriate review and approval by the Government [USAF 1996].

EXAMPLE 2
     The Contractor shall reuse preexisting or common items unless a determination is made to
     not re-use. Exceptions to reuse of pre-existing items must be accompanied by justification
     such as cost (both of adoption and life cycle support), schedule, functional and non-
     functional performance, etc. The general objective of these efforts shall be the development
     of common system and/or common elements or components which meet the performance
     requirements of the various [organizational] platform missions, where commonality offers
     the greatest technical and cost benefits [USN 2007a].

8.14.2 Section M - Evaluation


                               GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

 Stipulate that evaluation criteria will include the extent to which an Offerorâ€™s proposed technical
 solution builds on reuse of common functionality (Guidance 1775) [USAF 1996].

 Stipulate that evaluation criteria will include the extent to which an Offerorâ€™s proposed technical
 solution builds on well defined services (Guidance 1776) [USAF 1996].

8.14.3 Section L - Instructions to Offerors

EXAMPLE 1
     All Contractors shall use Net-Centric Enterprise Solutions for Interoperability (NESI) to
     assess the proposed technical solution [USN 2007].
     Stipulate that the Offeror is to describe how the proposed technical solution reuses services
     from other systems or demonstrates composeability and extensibility by building from
     existing reusable components and/or services (Best Practice1790) [USN 2007].
     Stipulate that the Offeror is to describe how the proposed technical solution demonstrates
     software practices that support reuse (Best Practice 1791) [USN 2007].




219 | CMU/SEI-2009-SR-008
                               GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

Give specific directions when requesting metric data on software reuse, so proposals can be
compared [SEI SASS].

Ask how the offeror determined percentage of code that could be reused [SEI SASS].

Will the system, network, and software architectures be implemented to minimize the amount of
modification and additions to reuse code? If so, discuss how this architecture will minimize
modification and addition to the code you will reuse [SEI SASS].

Below are examples of approaches to reusability with respect to software; similar examples are
appropriate for the reusability of other artifacts [USN 2007]:

     Component-based software: mission applications are architected as components integrated
     within a component framework.
     Layered software architecture: application software is separated into tiers that separate
     concerns; minimally, client, presentation, middle, and data tiers.
     Service-oriented architecture (SOA): services enable access to data and application
     functionality through public interfaces exposed to the enterprise.
     Separation of implementation and interface: services expose mission capabilities through
     well-defined interfaces and provide reliable and scalable components.

     satisfied and that the design being documented in accordance with standards established by
     the contractor and the contract [MIL-STD-QQQ].
     â€¢   Architecture Examination. The contractor shall ensure that the architecture of the
         computer program is examined for its implementability and capability to support the
         computational work load. This examination shall be completed satisfactorily prior to the
         commencement of any program implementation.
     â€¢   Design Walk-Through. The contractor shall employ the software engineering assessment
         practice of conducting internal design walk-through. A design walk-through of each
         portion of the software design must be completed prior to that portion of the design
         being implemented.
     â€¢   Computer System Resources. The contractor shall monitor periodically the availability
         of computer system resources such as memory, processor time, and input/output
         capacity. Their availability as contracted against allocated budgets shall be reported as
         part of the contractorâ€˜s status reporting system.
     â€¢   Program Functional Flow. The contractor shall provide for the independent assessment
         of the various types of graphical representations used to depict the flow of program data
         and control in all required modes of program operation for compliance with established
         standards.
     â€¢   Interface Definition. The contractor is required to identify and define all internal and
         external interfaces between the system being developed and all other interfacing

8.16 System Requirements

8.16.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements


                              GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

RFPs need to contain a description of the requirements of the system to be acquired, such as in a
system specification. In some cases, these requirements (based on capability description
documents and other information sources) may be general, with the expectation that the offerors
will refine these based on their experience and engineering judgment. In other cases, these
requirements will be specific, based on clearly defined capabilities and expectations. The ultimate
goal is to ensure that the system requirements specifications meet the nine qualities described in
IEEE Standard 830-1998, IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements
Specifications.

    Complete â€“ All external behaviors are defined.
    Unambiguous â€“ Every requirement has one and only one interpretation.
    Correct â€“ Every requirement stated is one that software shall meet.
    Consistent â€“ No subset of requirements conflict with each other.
    Verifiable â€“ A cost-effective finite process exists to show that each requirement has been
    successfully implemented.
    Modifiable â€“ Software requirements specifications structure and style are such that any
    changes to requirements can be made easily, completely, and consistently while retaining
    structure and style.
    Traceable â€“ Origin of each requirement is clear, and structure facilitates referencing each
    requirement within lower-level documentation.
    Ranked for importance â€“ Each requirement rated for criticality to system, based on negative
    impact should requirement not be implemented.
    Ranked for stability â€“ Each requirement rated for likelihood to change, based on changing
    expectations or level of uncertainty in its description.

8.17 Technical Performance Requirements Criteria

8.17.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

8.17.2 Section M - Evaluation

EXAMPLE 1
     The Offerorâ€˜s system performance specification will be evaluated in conjunction with the
     proposed technical solution based on the following criteria [DOD 2006]:
     1. Specification includes the key requirements and functionality identified in the RFPâ€˜s
        preliminary system performance specification.
     2. Performance (including logistics/sustainment/support) requirements are quantifiable
        and testable and/or verifiable.
     3. Objective values (goals) are clearly identified and distinguished from firm requirements.
     4. The operational and support environment is described and defined.
     5. Environmental design requirements are specified.
     6. Functional, electronic, physical, hardware, and software interfaces for the system are
        included.
     7. System FoS and SoS interoperability and interface requirements are established (both
        physical and functional). Considers Open Systems and Modularity standards.
     8. Appropriate use of Government and industry specifications, standards, and guides.
     9. Verification approaches for all system performance and sustainability requirements
        included in the specification are complete and appropriate.
     10. The specification does not include unnecessary requirements and language (e.g., SOW
         tasks, data requirements, and product or technical solution descriptions) [DOD 2006].

8.17.3 Section L - Instructions to Offerors

EXAMPLE 1
     The Offeror shall propose a System Performance Specification that meets the Government
     minimum requirements. The specification should be performance based and address the
     allocation of Government performance requirements plus any derived requirements
     necessary to describe the performance of the integrated system solution. Elements to be
     addressed in the System Performance Specification include [DOD 2006]:
     1. Accurate and complete understanding of the performance and support requirements in
        the Governmentâ€˜s preliminary system performance specification included in the RFP.
     2. Derived requirements necessary to document the system performance and sustainability
        that will govern the design, development, and test program.
     3. Identified and documented system-level operational, physical, and functional interfaces
        that define the program external interfaces and constraints. SoS and FoS
        interoperability and interface requirements are included for both physical and
        functional interfaces. Include considerations for Open Systems design.
     4. A verification section to the specification that delineates the approach to verifying all
        performance and support characteristics.

     5. A cross-reference matrix showing the tracking of Government performance
        requirements to the Offerorâ€˜s proposed system performance specification (i.e.,
        traceability). The specification should be structured for the proposed system solution
        and not restricted by the structure of the Governmentâ€˜s preliminary system performance
        specification. Include cross-reference to verification methods [DOD 2006].

8.18 Technology Readiness Assessment

8.18.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
     The Developer shall perform a system and software technology readiness assessment,
     utilizing the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) definitions/criteria specified in xxx of this
     SOW, and then prepare a Technology Readiness Assessment Report IAW DI-MISC-80508A
     and deliver IAW CDRL xxx. The purpose of the technology readiness assessment is to
     determine the software maturity state while determining the software development and
     operational risks. The TRL metrics can be associated with risk using the Technology
     Readiness Assessment versus Risk Assessment Table provided in Attachment 4 of this SOW
     [Army 2006].
     If the assessed TRL is TRL 7 or lower, then the Developer shall prepare a Technology
     Transition Plan (TTP) IAW DI-MISC 80508A. The purpose of the TTP is to address the
     programmatic and technical issues required to ensure that the software will be assessed at
     TRL 8 or above at the completion of its development. The DOD Technology Readiness
     Assessment Deskbook may be used as a guide in the preparation of these reports
     [Army 2006].

8.19 Technical Solution and Technical Supporting Data

8.19.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

8.19.2 Section M - Evaluation

EXAMPLE 1
     The technical solution and technical supporting data factor (subfactor) is satisfied when
     Offerorâ€˜s proposal demonstrates [DOD 2006]:
     1. The Offeror has conducted a series of trade studies, analyses, and modeling and
        simulations that systematically evaluated the range of alternatives leading to a preferred
        technical solution. The results support the technical and program requirements and
        validate the proposed configuration and the corresponding performance in the system
        specification.
     2. The trade study process was uniformly and consistently applied and followed the
        Offerorâ€˜s documented corporate enterprise processes.
     3. Trade study and decision criteria addressed the critical cost, schedule, technology, risk,
        and performance requirements (including operational and sustainment) and other
        considerations for the program with a high degree of confidence.

8.19.3 Section L - Instructions to Offerors

EXAMPLE 1
     The Offeror shall provide a summary of the trade studies and analyses accomplished to
     arrive at the proposed technical solution. The Offeror shall [DOD 2006]:
     1. Describe the trade study, analysis, and modeling and simulation processes implemented
        to arrive at the proposed technical solution; explain the level of fidelity of the models
        and simulations to support accurate and reliable results.
     2. Provide a summary of the trade studies, demonstrations, and analyses results that
        support the proposed technical solution and program technical approach.
     3. Provide a description of the trade study evaluation criteria, how they relate to the key
        performance requirements and constraints for the program, and the planned technical
        approach addressed in the contractorâ€˜s integrated SEP. The data shall address the
        range of alternatives considered and the important results that support the technical
        decisions and the program technical approach. If the contractor plans to mature a
        technology, back up plans should be assessed as well as risk mitigation planning.

8.20     Test and Evaluation

8.20.1 Section C - SOW/SOO; Requirements

EXAMPLE 1
       Environmental Testing: Contractual qualification testing conducted to illustrate the
       equipmentâ€˜s ability to operate during and after exposure to environmental extremes. The
       Government should provide within the RFP a comprehensive characterization of intended
       operational environments. Contractors will then develop tests to verify that system performs
       reliably in these environments [DOD 2005].

EXAMPLE 2
       In addition to functional testing of the software to assure compliance with requirements, the
       software will be tested such that 100 percent of the software branches (i.e., decision to
       decision statements) are exercised prior to release in the field. Reasons for not achieving
       100 percent execution coverage must be formally documented in the Software Test Report
       [USN 2006].
       Software tools (i.e., test coverage analyzers) to automate the branch testing process are
       available. Intrusive analyzers insert software code into the software under development to
       capture and record the execution coverage and are appropriate for non-real-time software
       developments. If a software product under development must operate in real-time, if it is
       highly memory constrained, or if the software units are very large, non-intrusive analyzers
       should be used. Non-intrusive analyzers use a separate hardware processor to capture and
       record this same execution coverage information [USN 2006].

8.20.2 Section M - Evaluation

EXAMPLE 1
       The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror provides a reasonable and
       complete strategy for planning and conducting qualification testing and regression testing
       for each build, for the incremental portion of each software item developed in the build, and
       for end-to-end build testing including reuse software, commercial item, GOTS, software
       tools, and test bed software. The strategy credibly shows comprehensive testing is
       performed, efficient test progression, efficient use of software tools and test beds. The
       regression test strategy ensures continued adequacy of previously verified software
       following any changes to the software, including changes driven by problem reports,
       changed requirements, or integration of subsequent blocks, if applicable. The strategy
       includes a credible, comprehensive approach for managing and resolving risks and
       weaknesses identified during test reviews, adequate insight through Government-witnessed
       tests, and an achievable strategy to obtain test facility certification [SEI 2007a].

13. ABSTRACT (MAXIMUM 200 WORDS)
     Organizations developing a Request for Proposal (RFP) often look to existing sources for ideas on how to phrase language for a specific
     topic -- a time-consuming exercise that usually involves searching across multiple publications.
      With this report, the Software Engineering Institute has compiled publicly available recommendations for RFP content, and examples of
     language for federal RFP Sections C, M, and L. The paper, one element of the implementation plan for the Army Strategic Software Im-
     provement Program, defines and communicates software engineering and management events and deliverables necessary to support
     the successful acquisition of software intensive systems.
