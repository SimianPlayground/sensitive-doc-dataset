How to use this form
  Dear Member:
  Usually, all providers of health care will bill us for services to you and your enrolled dependents. This is the preferred procedure. You are not
  bothered with claim forms and we often need more details than are ordinarily provided on bills to patients.
  Sometimes, a physician or an ambulance company may not bill us, for example, they may send the bill directly to you. In either instance, we have
  no way of knowing about your claim. This Medical Claim Form was developed to notify us of any covered health service for which we have not
  already been billed. Please read the following instructions about how to report Health Care Services.
  We are happy to serve you.

Section 1: Patient information
  Use this section to identify the patient.

Section 2: Subscriber information (on Anthem ID card)
  Use this section to identify the subscriber. Some of this information may be found on your Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield card.
