1. IDENTIFICATION OF NEW CUSTOMERS

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law
requires us to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an
account. When you open your first account with us, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth,
and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license
or other identifying documents. In addition, you may be asked several questions, and we may use
outside sources to confirm the information. The information you provide is protected by our privacy
policy and by federal law. We may repeat the identification process when you open another account
and have had no active account with us during the past five years.

2. CALIFORNIA FAIR LENDING NOTICE

It is illegal to discriminate in the provision of or in the availability of financial assistance because of the
consideration of:

     1. Trends, characteristics or conditions in the neighborhood or geographic area surrounding a
        housing accommodation, unless the financial institution can demonstrate in the particular case
        that such consideration is required to avoid an unsafe and unsound business practice; or
     `
     2. Race, color, religion, sex, marital status, national origin or ancestry.

It is illegal to consider the racial, ethnic, religious or national origin composition of a neighborhood or
geographic area surrounding a housing accommodation or whether or not such composition is
undergoing change, or is expected to undergo change, in appraising a housing accommodation or in
determining whether or not, or under what terms and conditions, to provide financial assistance.

These provisions govern financial assistance for the purpose of the purchase, construction,
rehabilitation or refinancing of one-to-four-unit family residences occupied by the owner and for the
purpose of the home improvement of any one-to-four-unit family residence.

If you have questions about your rights, or if you wish to file a complaint, contact the management of

NOTICE: The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against
credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided
the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicant’s

4. DISCLOSURE CONCERNING YOUR RIGHT TO RECEIVE A COPY OF THE APPRAISAL
REPORT

We may order an appraisal to determine the property’s value and charge you for this appraisal. We
will promptly give you a copy of any appraisal, even if your loan does not close. You can pay for an
additional appraisal for your own use at your own expense.

If you applied for a loan secured by a one- to four-family residential structure, you have the right to
receive a copy of the appraisal report and other written valuations developed in connection with your
application for credit. We will deliver a copy to your last-known address. If there is more than one
applicant, a copy will be delivered to the primary applicant, where one is readily apparent. Copies
can be provided to a consumer applicant in an electronic format so long as the creditor complies with
the disclosure and consumer consent provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National
Commerce Act (E-SIGN Act).

The Bank may require that you pay for the cost incurred in obtaining the appraisal or valuation.
Please note that any appraisal we obtain in connection with your loan application will be for the
purpose of assisting us in determining whether to extend credit to be secured by the appraised
property and, if so, upon what terms. Depending upon the amount and the nature of the loan
requested among other factors, the appraisal may be conducted by a certified appraiser, a licensed
appraiser, or someone who is neither licensed nor certified. The person performing the appraisal
may be a Bank employee or an independent contractor. The appraisal report should not be relied
upon by you or anyone else to determine the value, description, or condition of the property. If you
wish professional assistance in determining those matters, you should retain your own appraiser or
other advisor.

have paid for the appraisal and the cost of duplicating the appraisal. In order to obtain a copy of your
appraisal report, write us at:

                                                   Santa Rosa, CA. 95402

We must hear from you no later than 90 days after we notify you about the action taken on your credit
application, including notice of an incomplete application. If you withdraw your application, you must
make your request for an appraisal report within 90 days of the withdrawal.

If you request a copy of your appraisal report, and you have paid for the costs of the appraisal, we will
send you a copy at the address shown on your loan application. You are only entitled to receive a
copy of the appraisal for purposes of evaluating your pending request for an extension of credit with
this Bank.
