 INTEREST RATES AND LOAN TERMS
 While loan rates, terms, and conditions are determined on a case-by-case basis, based upon the
 financial strength of the borrower and the underwriting principals, the overall mission of the Bucks
 County Industrial Development Authority (BCIDA) is to actively promote a strong and vibrant economy
 through new business investment and robust job creation and retention. For that reason, our
 underwriting allows for a greater risk than commercial banks will generally accept and loans made by
 the BCIDA involve discounted financing, ordinarily ½ percent below the current prime rate, with an
 amortization or repayment schedule tied to the life of the asset. Generally the rates and terms are as
 follows:

 Land & Building                                  20 year amortization with 10 year balloon payment
 Machinery & Equipment                            7 year amortization with 5 year balloon payment
 Working Capital                                  5 year amortization with 3 year balloon payment

 FEES
 Non-Refundable Application Fee as follows:

 Loans up to $100,000                              $250.00
 Loans up to $200,000                              $750.00
 Loans from $200,001 up to $500,000               $1,000.00
 Loans from $500,001 and up                       $1,500.00

 Placement Fee                                    One percent (1%) of loan payable at closing (may be
                                                  modified upon approval of the BCIDA) in addition to
                                                  related and necessary legal fees, including document
