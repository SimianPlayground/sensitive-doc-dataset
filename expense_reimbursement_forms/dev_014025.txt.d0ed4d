TRANSPORTATION/PARKING EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT INSTRUCTIONS
Before you begin—check with your employer to find out if you have the transportation or parking program.

What’s a transportation or parking expense?
It’s an expense you pay for eligible work transportation or parking. For example it could be:
    • Transportation:
        » Bus and light rail fares.
        » Train and subway tickets.
    • Parking:
        » Parking ramps, lots, and tolls.

These are common terms that can help you decide if you have an eligible transportation or parking expense:
  • Transit pass — This could be a pass, token, fare card, voucher, or similar item that lets you ride, free of charge
      or at a reduced rate:
      » On mass transit. Mass transit includes bus, rail, or ferry.
      » In a vehicle that seats at least six adults (not including the driver). The driver must be paid to transport
           people.
  • Commuter highway vehicle (van pooling) — This is any highway vehicle that seats at least 6 adults (not
      including the driver). At least 80 percent of the mileage is for transporting people between home and the work
      place. Employees must use at least half of the vehicle’s seats (not including the driver’s).
  • Qualified parking — This means parking that’s provided to an employee. It’s near the business area of the
      employer. Or, parking that’s on or near a location from which the employee rides to work in a commuter highway
      vehicle. Parking on or near your home doesn’t qualify.

When do I need to send in my transportation or parking claims?
You’ll need to send your request for reimbursement at least every 180 days unless you have contract parking (that is just
once a year to get the recurring claim set up). This is required by the IRS.

What kinds of documentation can I send?
You’ll need to send all of the following (required by the IRS):
  • Date and year of transportation expense (needs to be itemized by month).
  • Name of person claiming expense.
  • Type of transportation expense.
  • Amount of expense.
  • Name of provider of transportation service (van pooling service only).
  • Signature of provider (van pooling service only).
  • Receipt of expense (if available).

Can I get reimbursed for an expense that hasn’t happened yet (i.e., requesting June claim in May)?
Yes, you just simply need to send documentation showing the expense was already paid. If you don’t include this
information, we can’t process the claim until after the expense has happened.

Before you send your form—check for these common mistakes:
  • Did you sign and date the form?
  • Did you include your documentation? For more than one expense listed on a receipt, be sure you circle each one.
      Don’t highlight the expense items.
  • Did you fill out the reimbursement form completely?
  • Does the documentation match the amount you’re asking for?
  • Did you keep a copy of your reimbursement form?
  • Did you send a copy of your receipts and not the originals? You’ll want to keep the original receipts for your
      records.
