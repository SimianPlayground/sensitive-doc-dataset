  You (the Borrower) can apply for forgiveness of your Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan using this SBA Form 3508EZ if
  you can check at least one of the three boxes below. Do not submit this Checklist with your SBA Form 3508EZ.

      ☐ The Borrower is a self-employed individual, independent contractor, or sole proprietor who had no employees at the time
        of the PPP loan application and did not include any employee salaries in the computation of average monthly payroll in
        the Borrower Application Form (SBA Form 2483).
                  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ☐ The Borrower did not reduce annual salary or hourly wages of any employee by more than 25 percent during the Covered
        Period or the Alternative Payroll Covered Period (as defined below) compared to the period between January 1, 2020 and
        March 31, 2020 (for purposes of this statement, “employees” means only those employees that did not receive, during any
        single period during 2019, wages or salary at an annualized rate of pay in an amount more than $100,000);
                                                                          AND
        The Borrower did not reduce the number of employees or the average paid hours of employees between January 1, 2020
        and the end of the Covered Period. (Ignore reductions that arose from an inability to rehire individuals who were
        employees on February 15, 2020 if the Borrower was unable to hire similarly qualified employees for unfilled positions
        on or before December 31, 2020. Also ignore reductions in an employee’s hours that the Borrower offered to restore and
        the employee refused. See 85 FR 33004, 33007 (June 1, 2020) for more details.
                  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      ☐ The Borrower did not reduce annual salary or hourly wages of any employee by more than 25 percent during the Covered
        Period or the Alternative Payroll Covered Period (as defined below) compared to the period between January 1, 2020 and

        single period during 2019, wages or salary at an annualized rate of pay in an amount more than $100,000);
                                                                          AND
        The Borrower was unable to operate during the Covered Period at the same level of business activity as before February

  If you can check at least one of the three boxes above, complete this SBA Form 3508EZ in accordance with the instructions below,
  and submit it to your Lender (or the Lender that is servicing your loan). Borrowers may also complete this application
  electronically through their Lender. If you are unable to check one of the boxes above, you cannot use SBA Form 3508EZ and
  instead you must apply for forgiveness of your PPP loan using SBA Form 3508.

                                         PPP Loan Forgiveness Application Form 3508EZ

  EIDL Advance Amount: If the Borrower received an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) advance, enter the amount.

  EIDL Application Number: If the Borrower applied for an EIDL, enter the Borrower’s EIDL Application Number.

  Payroll Schedule: Select the box that corresponds to your payroll schedule.

  Covered Period: The Covered Period is either: (1) the 24-week (168-day) period beginning on the PPP Loan Disbursement Date,
  or (2) if the Borrower received its PPP loan before June 5, 2020, the Borrower may elect to use an eight-week (56-day) Covered
  Period. For example, if the Borrower is using a 24-week Covered Period and received its PPP loan proceeds on Monday, April 20,
  the first day of the Covered Period is April 20 and the last day of the Covered Period is Sunday, October 4. In no event may the
  Covered Period extend beyond December 31, 2020.

  Alternative Payroll Covered Period: For administrative convenience, Borrowers with a biweekly (or more frequent) payroll
  schedule may elect to calculate eligible payroll costs using the 24-week (168-day) period or for loans received before June 5, 2020
  at the election of the borrower, the eight-week (56-day) period that begins on the first day of their first pay period following their
  PPP Loan Disbursement Date. For example, if the Borrower is using a 24-week Alternative Payroll Covered Period and received
  its PPP loan proceeds on Monday, April 20, and the first day of its first pay period following its PPP loan disbursement is Sunday,
  April 26, the first day of the Alternative Payroll Covered Period is April 26 and the last day of the Alternative Payroll Covered
  Period is Saturday, October 10. Borrowers that elect to use the Alternative Payroll Covered Period must apply the Alternative
  Payroll Covered Period wherever there is a reference in this application to “the Covered Period or the Alternative Payroll Covered
  Period.” However, Borrowers must apply the Covered Period (not the Alternative Payroll Covered Period) wherever there is a
  reference in this application to “the Covered Period” only. In no event may the Alternative Payroll Covered Period extend beyond
  December 31, 2020.

  If Borrower Received PPP Loans in Excess of $2 Million: Check the box if the Borrower, together with its affiliates (to
  the extent required under SBA’s interim final rule on affiliates (85 FR 20817 (April 15, 2020)) and not waived under 15
  U.S.C. 636(a)(36)(D)(iv)), received PPP loans with an original principal amount in excess of $2 million.

  Forgiveness Amount Calculation (see Summary of Costs Eligible for Forgiveness below):

  Line 1: Enter total eligible payroll costs incurred or paid during the Covered Period or the Alternative Payroll Covered Period.
  To calculate these costs, sum the following:

        Cash Compensation: The sum of gross salary, gross wages, gross tips, gross commissions, paid leave (vacation, family,
        medical or sick leave, not including leave covered by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act), and allowances for
        dismissal or separation paid or incurred during the Covered Period or the Alternative Payroll Covered Period. For each
        individual employee, the total amount of cash compensation eligible for forgiveness may not exceed an annual salary of
        $100,000, as prorated for the Covered Period. For an 8-week Covered Period, that total is $15,385. For a 24-week Covered
        Period, that total is $46,154 for purposes of this 3508EZ. You can only include compensation of employees who were
        employed by the Borrower at any point during the Covered Period or Alternative Payroll Covered Period and whose
        principal place of residence is in the United States.

        Employee Benefits: The total amount paid by the Borrower for:
           1. Employer contributions for employee health insurance, including employer contributions to a self-insured,
               employer-sponsored group health plan, but excluding any pre-tax or after-tax contributions by employees. Do not
               add employer health insurance contributions made on behalf of a self-employed individual, general partners, or
               owner-employees of an S-corporation, because such payments are already included in their compensation.
           2. Employer contributions to employee retirement plans, excluding any pre-tax or after-tax contributions by
               employees. Do not add employer retirement contributions made on behalf of a self-employed individual or general
               partners, because such payments are already included in their compensation, and contributions on behalf of owner-
               employees are capped at 2.5 months’ worth of the 2019 contribution amount.
           3. Employer state and local taxes paid by the borrower and assessed on employee compensation (e.g., state
               unemployment insurance tax), excluding any taxes withheld from employee earnings.

        Owner Compensation: Enter any amounts paid to owners (owner-employees, a self-employed individual, or general
        partners). For a 24-week Covered Period, this amount is capped at $20,833 (the 2.5-month equivalent of $100,000 per year)
        for each individual or the 2.5-month equivalent of their applicable compensation in 2019, whichever is lower. For an 8-
        week Covered Period, this amount is capped at 8/52 of 2019 compensation (up to $15,385).

  Line 2: Enter the amount of business mortgage interest payments paid or incurred during the Covered Period for any business
  mortgage obligation on real or personal property incurred before February 15, 2020. Do not include prepayments.

  Line 3: Enter the amount of business rent or lease payments paid or incurred for real or personal property during the Covered
  Period, pursuant to lease agreements in force before February 15, 2020.

  Line 4: Enter the amount of business utility payments paid or incurred during the Covered Period, for business utilities for which
  service began before February 15, 2020.

  NOTE: For lines 2-4, you are not required to report payments that you do not want to include in the forgiveness amount.

  Line 5: Add lines 1 through 4, enter the total.

  Line 6: Enter the PPP Loan Amount.

  Line 7: Divide the amount on line 1 by 0.60, and enter the amount. This determines whether at least 60% of the potential
  forgiveness amount was used for payroll costs.

  Line 8: Enter the smallest of lines 5, 6, or 7. Note: If applicable, SBA will deduct EIDL Advance Amounts from the forgiveness
  amount remitted to the Lender.

  Summary of Costs Eligible for Forgiveness:

  Borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness for the following costs:
   1. Eligible payroll costs. Borrowers are generally eligible for forgiveness for the payroll costs paid and payroll costs incurred
        during the 24-week (168-day) or 8-week (56-day) Covered Period (or Alternative Payroll Covered Period) (“payroll costs”).
       Payroll costs are considered paid on the day that paychecks are distributed or the Borrower originates an ACH credit
       transaction. Payroll costs are considered incurred on the day that the employee’s pay is earned. Payroll costs incurred but
       not paid during the Borrower’s last pay period of the Covered Period (or Alternative Payroll Covered Period) are eligible
       for forgiveness if paid on or before the next regular payroll date. Otherwise, payroll costs must be paid during the Covered
       Period (or Alternative Payroll Covered Period). For each individual employee, the total amount of cash compensation
        eligible for forgiveness may not exceed an annual salary of $100,000, as prorated for the Covered Period. Count payroll
       costs that were both paid and incurred only once. For information on what qualifies as payroll costs, see Interim Final Rule
       on Paycheck Protection Program posted on April 2, 2020 (85 FR 20811), as amended by the Revisions to First Interim Final
        Rule, posted on June 11, 2020). Include only payroll costs for employees whose principal place of residence is in the
        United States.

    2.   Eligible nonpayroll costs. Nonpayroll costs eligible for forgiveness consist of:
             (a) covered mortgage obligations: payments of mortgage interest (not including any prepayment or payment of principal)
             on any business mortgage obligation on real or personal property incurred before February 15, 2020 (“business mortgage
             interest payments”);
             (b) covered rent obligations: business rent or lease payments pursuant to lease agreements for real or personal property in
             force before February 15, 2020 (“business rent or lease payments”); and
             (c) covered utility payments: business payments for a service for the distribution of electricity, gas, water,
             telephone, transportation, or internet access for which service began before February 15, 2020 (“business utility
             payments”).
         An eligible nonpayroll cost must be paid during the Covered Period or incurred during the Covered Period and paid on or
         before the next regular billing date, even if the billing date is after the Covered Period. Eligible nonpayroll costs cannot
         exceed 40% of the total forgiveness amount. Count nonpayroll costs that were both paid and incurred only once.

          of this certification, the term “employee” includes only those employees that did not receive, during any single period during
          2019, wages or salary at an annualized rate of pay in an amount more than $100,000.
 _____    The Borrower has accurately verified the payments for the eligible payroll and nonpayroll costs for which the Borrower is
          requesting forgiveness.
 _____    I have submitted to the Lender the required documentation verifying payroll costs, the existence of obligations and service
          (as applicable) prior to February 15, 2020, and eligible business mortgage interest payments, business rent or lease payments,
          and business utility payments.
 _____    The information provided in this application and the information provided in all supporting documents and forms is true
          and correct in all material respects. I understand that knowingly making a false statement to obtain forgiveness of an SBA-
          guaranteed loan is punishable under the law, including 18 USC 1001 and 3571 by imprisonment of not more than five years
          and/or a fine of up to $250,000; under 15 USC 645 by imprisonment of not more than two years and/or a fine of not more
          than $5,000; and, if submitted to a Federally insured institution, under 18 USC 1014 by imprisonment of not more than thirty
          years and/or a fine of not more than $1,000,000.
 _____    The tax documents I have submitted to the Lender are consistent with those the Borrower has submitted/will submit to
          the IRS and/or state tax or workforce agency. I also understand, acknowledge, and agree that the Lender can share the
          tax information with SBA’s authorized representatives, including authorized representatives of the SBA Office of
          Inspector General, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with PPP requirements and all SBA reviews.
 _____    I understand, acknowledge, and agree that SBA may request additional information for the purposes of evaluating the
          Borrower’s eligibility for the PPP loan and for loan forgiveness, and that the Borrower’s failure to provide information
          requested by SBA may result in a determination that the Borrower was ineligible for the PPP loan or a denial of the
          Borrower’s loan forgiveness application.
In addition, the Authorized Representative of the Borrower must certify by initialing at least ONE of the following two items:
_____      The Borrower did not reduce the number of employees or the average paid hours of employees between January 1, 2020 and
           the end of the Covered Period (other than any reductions that arose from an inability to rehire individuals who were
           employees on February 15, 2020, if the Borrower was unable to hire similarly qualified employees for unfilled positions on
           or before December 31, 2020, and reductions in an employee’s hours that a borrower offered to restore and were refused).
 _____    The Borrower was unable to operate between February 15, 2020, and the end of the Covered Period at the same level of
          business activity as before February 15, 2020 due to compliance with requirements established or guidance issued between
          March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the Centers for
          Disease Control and Prevention, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, related to the maintenance of
          standards of sanitation, social distancing, or any other work or customer safety requirement related to COVID-19.
The Borrower’s eligibility for loan forgiveness will be evaluated in accordance with the PPP regulations and guidance issued by
SBA through the date of this application. SBA may direct a lender to disapprove the Borrower’s loan forgiveness application if SBA
determines that the Borrower was ineligible for the PPP loan.
