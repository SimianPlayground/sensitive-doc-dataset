                *Federal Privacy Act Statement
                Disclosure of your Social Security number is required and authorized under law, for the purpose of tax administration and identifica-
                tion of any individual affected by applicable law, 42 U.S.C. sec. 405(c)(2)(C)(i); Texas Govt. Code Sections 403.011, 403.056, and
                403.078. Release of information on this form in response to a public information request will be governed by the Public Information
                Act, Chapter 552, Government Code, and applicable federal law.

    Section 3: New Account Information (Needed for setups and changes)
              Completion by financial institution is recommended.
              Important: Your direct deposit account information may be different from the account information printed
              on your checks. It is recommended that you contact your financial institution to confirm your direct deposit
              account information.
              Prenote Test:
              A prenote test will be sent to your financial institution for the account information provided. The prenote
              test is for a period of six banking days, and it is sent to your financial institution to verify your account
              information. If no further action is required by your financial institution, your direct deposit instructions will
              become effective when the six banking day prenote time frame has expired.

              When requesting a change to your existing direct deposit account information, you must complete Section
              4 with the existing account information for verification purposes. This measure will help the paying state
              agency verify accuracy of the requested change.

    Section 5: International Payments Verification
              Check "YES" or "NO" to indicate if direct deposit payments to the account information designated in
              Section 3 of this form will be forwarded to a financial institution outside the United States. If "YES," also
              complete the ACH (Direct Deposit) Payment Destination Confirmation (Form 74-227).
