I.     PURPOSE

       The Commonwealth of Virginia, Department of General Services, Division of Purchases and Supply
       (“Commonwealth” or “DGS” or “DPS”) is issuing this formal RFP E194-20029 for the purpose of
       establishing a term contract (“Contract” or “Agreement”) with one qualified firm to provide Curtailment
       Services Provider-Demand Response Services (CSP) hereinafter referred to as “Services.” The initial
       term of the Agreement will be three (3) years with three (3) additional one-year renewal options.

II.    BACKGROUND

       The Commonwealth of Virginia is the twelfth most populous state in the U.S. and home to approximately
       eight million residents. Virginia is approximately 42,700 square miles, ranking it the 35th largest state.
       This area is comprised of five distinct regions: Tidewater, Piedmont, Blue Ridge Mountains, Valley and
       Ridge, and Appalachian Plateau. Virginia political subdivisions are organized into 95 counties and 38
       independent cities which are considered to be county-equivalents.

       The Pew Center on the States, Forbes Magazine and many other leading national organizations, have
       identified Virginia as one of the best-managed states in the nation as evidenced by its long-standing AAA
       bond rating. In recent years, USA Today and Forbes Magazine have ranked Virginia as America’s Top
       State for Business. According to Virginia Performs, considerable credit for this recognition is a result of
       the state’s commitment to enterprise-level performance management, accountability, and transparency to
       ensure the best use of public resources, and to oversee the major administrative functions of state
       government, which includes the procurement of all needed goods and services. Virginia is committed to
       business-first values at all levels of government, providing easy access to global markets, and offering
       stability with low operating costs.

       The Commonwealth’s Division of Purchases and Supply (DPS) is a principal business unit operating
       within the Virginia Department of General Services (DGS). DPS is the central procurement authority for
       the Commonwealth through which every authority, department, division, institution, officer, agency, and
       other unit of state government is to purchase all materials, equipment, supplies, printing and
       nonprofessional services of every description.

       DPS is managing this RFP procurement process on the behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia,
       Department of Mines, Minerals, & Energy (DMME). The assigned DPS SSSO is responsible to assist
       DMME in the development of the solicitation. DPS will manage the procurement process, facilitate and
       negotiate any contract documents, and manage the subsequent contract (s), if any, which may result from
       the RFP.

       The Commonwealth of Virginia Agencies, Institutions of Higher Education and other public Bodies have
       the ability to curtail consumption of electricity in many locations across the Commonwealth through
       various means. It is our desire to put a Demand Response Program in place using a CSP through PJM
       Interconnection (PJM) to coordinate this activity. PJM is a regional transmission organization (RTO) that
       coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
       Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia
       and the District of Columbia. This program will provide a mechanism to respond to an electric utility
       curtailment and provide a financial benefit to participating organizations.

       The objective of this program is to determine the optimum method of scheduling activities with high
       electrical demand and to reduce requirements at peak demand time for PJM. By reducing the demand at
       peak times PJM is saved from having to generate more electricity, electricity that is usually more costly to
       generate. By reducing peak demand, at set times, Commonwealth agencies, institutions of higher
       education and public bodies can receive incentives as part of the PJM demand response program to
       lower the overall cost of electrical power.

III.   INFORMATION

        1. For the purpose of this solicitation and any resulting contract, DGS/DPS is referred to as the
           “Contracting Agency”. Agencies utilizing the services described herein and provided as a result of

VI. STATEMENT OF NEEDS

     It is the Commonwealth of Virginia’s intent to enter into a Contract with the selected Offeror for those
     services necessary to help the Commonwealth achieve its Goals, as outlined in this RFP. The selected
     Offeror shall provide the following services:

     1. The Commonwealth requires the services of an experienced, qualified Curtailment Service Provider
        (CSP) to provide Demand Response Services as associated with PJM “Load Response Program
        (LRP)” currently available. Additionally if new programs are offered by PJM during the contract period
        the Commonwealth reserves the right to negotiate with the vendor to incorporate these programs into
        the contract. Proposals shall address cost reduction and how costs and cost reduction are allocated
        to the Contractor and Commonwealth Agencies, Institutions of Higher Education or other Public
        Bodies.

     2. The objective is to determine the optimum method of scheduling activities with high electrical demand
        and to reduce requirements at peak demand times for PJM. By reducing the demand at peak times
        PJM is saved from having to generate more electricity; electricity that is usually more costly to
        generate. By reducing peak demand, at set times, Commonwealth Agencies, Institutions of Higher
        Education and Public Bodies can receive incentives as part of the PJM demand response program to
        lower the overall cost of electrical power.

     3. When, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Agencies, Institutions of Higher Education and\all Public
        Bodies, the quality of materials, equipment, and/or workmanship put in place by the Contractor does
        not meet the specifications in this RFP or the contract arising from this RFP, the Contractor shall, at
        no additional cost to the Commonwealth Agencies, Institutions of Higher Education and Public Bodies
        immediately remove the nonconforming portion of the work and replace it with material, equipment,
        and/or workmanship which does meet specifications. When disputes arise concerning workmanship
        and/or material selected for work already accomplished, the Contractor shall, at no cost to the
        Commonwealth Agencies, Institution of Higher Education, and Public Bodies, remove, replace, and/or
        rework the job so that compliance with the Commonwealth's requirements are satisfied.

     4. The Commonwealth will establish a Contract Administrator to work with the Contractor. The Contract
        Administrator will be the only authorized person that the Contractor shall deal with for purposes of this
        contract, unless the Contract Administrator designates other personnel to assist in the administration
        of the contract.

     5. The Contractor shall cooperate with the Commonwealth Agencies, Institutions of Higher Education
        and Public Bodies concerning the scheduling of work, change of work, changed location(s) due to
        classes, testing, or special events, and/or the performance of additional work. The representative will
        be notified prior to the blocking off or closing down of any portion of buildings or grounds. The
        Contractor shall promptly notify the Commonwealth's Contract Administrator if any change of work or
        any type of condition that will prevent the Contractor from meeting the requirements set forth by this
        RFP, and any contract arising from this RFP. The representative will evaluate such information and
        will provide guidance to the Contractor.

     6. The Commonwealth and its Public Entities will not be responsible for losses or damages of the
        Contractor supplies, tools, and/or equipment. Damages caused by the Contractor negligence or error
        shall be repaired by the Contractor at no cost to the Commonwealth, or Public Entities. All equipment

        not be limited to, planning and scheduling of work and complete work requirements within the
        Commonwealth's specified time limits to assure the performance of work in accordance with the

     8. The Contractor shall provide all the labor, equipment, supplies and material for collecting energy
        consumption and demand data from the BAS or electric utility, analyzing data, and providing services

         a.      One (1) original proposal (marked “Original”);
         b.      Three (3) hard copies (marked “Copy”);
         c.     One (1) electronic copy on a CD or flash drive;
         d.      One (1) hard redacted copy, if applicable, from which trade secrets or proprietary information
                 has been obscured or redacted. The redacted version must have all trade secrets or proprietary
                 information obscured that was stated on the Proprietary/Confidential Information Identification
                 form in Attachment D; and
         e.      One (1) electronic redacted copy on a CD or flash drive.

         By submitting a signed proposal in response to this RFP, Offeror certifies that:

         a.     Un-redacted paper and un-redacted electronic proposal responses are identical, and
         b.     Redacted paper and redacted electronic proposal responses are identical.

    2. Proposals should be prepared simply and economically providing a straightforward and concise
       description of capabilities to satisfy the requirements of the RFP. Emphasis should be placed on
       completeness and clarity of content. Offerors are strongly encouraged to prepare and organize
       their proposal as follows:

         a.    Contain in a single 3-ring binder;
         b.    Limit to 75 typed pages, signed and filled out as required;
         c.    Use font no smaller than 11 point;
         d.    Use 8½ x 11 inch size paper (larger pages should be used sparingly for spreadsheets or tables
               and should be folded into the overall proposal);
         e.    Number all pages;
         f.   Organize using tab dividers and in the order described in Section VIII.B. entitled “Specific
              Requirements”;
         g.    Reference the paragraph number of the corresponding section of the RFP and cite the
               paragraph number, sub letter, and repeat the text of the requirement as it appears in the RFP. If
               a response covers more than one page, the paragraph number and sub letter should be
               repeated at the top of the next page; and

To include Addendums 1, 2, & 3                       Page 7 of 34        Curtailment Svc Provider / Demand Response Svcs
         h.    Contain a table of contents that cross references the RFP requirements.

    3. Critical Requirements: As used in this RFP, the terms "must", "shall", "should" and “may” identify the
       criticality of requirements. "Must" and "shall" identify requirements that are mandatory and may be
       required by law or regulation. The inability of an Offeror to satisfy a "must" or "shall" requirement may
       seriously affect the overall rating score of the proposal. The terms “should” or “may” indicate highly
       desirable requests.

    4. Proprietary / Confidential Information: Ownership of all data, materials and documentation originated and
       prepared pursuant to the RFP shall belong exclusively to the Commonwealth and be subject to public
       inspection in accordance with the Virginia Freedom of Information Act.

         Trade secrets or proprietary information submitted by an Offeror shall not be subject to public disclosure
         under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act; however, Offeror shall invoke the protections of Code of
         Virginia § 2-4342D in writing, either before or at the time the data or other material is submitted. Offeror
         shall complete and provide the “Proprietary/Confidential Information Identification” form in Attachment D,
         if applicable, and must specifically identify the data or materials to be protected and state the reasons for
         which protection is necessary. The trade secret or proprietary material submitted must be identified by
         some distinct method such as highlighting or underlining and must indicate only the specific words,
         figures, or paragraphs that constitute trade secret or proprietary information. The classification of an
         entire proposal document, line item prices and/or total proposal prices as trade secrets and/or
         proprietary is not acceptable and may be rejected by the Commonwealth.

    5.    Exceptions to Terms and Conditions: The Commonwealth discourages exceptions to terms and
         conditions in the RFP. The Commonwealth and Evaluation Team may make a decision on the
         selection of the Offeror for negotiations based on the initial proposals without clarification or an
         opportunity for offeror discussion; therefore, the nature of exceptions would be evaluated to
         determine the extent to which the alternative language or approach poses unreasonable additional
         risk to the Participating Entities, is judged to inhibit achieving the objectives of the RFP, whose
         ambiguity makes evaluation difficult and a fair resolution impractical given the timeframe for the RFP,
         or the exception or correction of what is deemed to be a deficiency or unacceptable exception would
         require a substantial proposal rewrite to correct.

         Offeror should identify and seek to clarify any concerns with RFP language or any other document
         contained within this RFP through their written inquiries about the RFP using the process described
         below in Section VIII. B.6. Offeror shall complete and provide the “Exceptions to RFP-E194-20029”
         form in Attachment E.

    6. Questions and RFP Amendments

         a.    Questions: Offeror shall be fully responsible for understanding the Statement of Needs, terms
               and conditions, all other aspects of the RFP, and factors affecting contract performance before
               submitting a proposal. It shall be the Offeror’s sole responsibility to inquire and obtain
               clarification if the Offeror does not fully understand the entire RFP requirements. The
               Commonwealth’s verbal responses to questions are not binding; therefore, no questions will be
               answered by phone.

               Questions regarding the solicitation must be submitted in writing to Tina Rodriguez, via
               e-mail no later than 2:00 P.M. on Thursday, May 25, 2017. Identify the question by noting
               the solicitation number “RFP# E194-20029” in the subject line of the email. Official answers to all
               written questions will be posted in eVA’s Virginia Business Opportunities (VBO) as an
               amendment to the RFP. The identity of a potential Offeror will not be published with the answers;
               however, the text of questions may be restated and Offerors should not include language in
               questions that may reveal their firm’s identity.

         b.    RFP Amendments: Formal changes to the RFP, including but not limited to contractual terms
               and procurement requirements, will only be changed by formal written amendments issued by
               the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth shall accept no responsibility for an Offeror not
               receiving the solicitation, amendments and/or other solicitation documents. Offeror shall be

To include Addendums 1, 2, & 3                       Page 8 of 34        Curtailment Svc Provider / Demand Response Svcs
                solely responsible for regularly checking the status of the solicitation in eVA’s VBO for any
                updates, changes, amendments, or other information pertaining to the RFP.

    7. Oral Presentation: Offeror submitting a response to this RFP may be required to give at any time during
       the proposal evaluation process, a brief oral presentation clarifying or elaborating on their proposal. This
       is a fact-finding and explanation session only and does not include negotiations. The issuing agency will
       schedule the time and location of these presentations which will be made at the Offeror’s expense. In
       conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted
       by competing Offerors. The Commonwealth and Evaluation Team reserve the right to evaluate on receipt
       of initial proposals without an opportunity for oral presentations; therefore, proposal responses should
       be complete. Oral presentations are an option of the contracting agency and may or may not be
       conducted.

    8. Proposal Submission for Request for Sealed Proposal: Offeror shall return the signed proposal in a
       sealed envelope. The sealed envelope should be addressed as follows:

               be placed in the envelope.

X.     ORAL PRESENTATIONS

       Offeror submitting a response to this RFP may be required to give at any time during the proposal
       evaluation process, a brief oral presentation clarifying or elaborating on their proposal. This is a fact-finding

         contract on the basis of the recipient's religion, religious belief, refusal to participate in a religious
         practice, or on the basis of race, age, color, gender or national origin and shall be subject to the same

         provided; however, if the faith-based organization segregates public funds into separate accounts,
         only the accounts and programs funded with public funds shall be subject to audit by the public body

                 bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the

              c. Notices, advertisements and solicitations placed in accordance with federal law, rule or
                 regulation shall be deemed sufficient for the purpose of meeting these requirements.

         Contractor will include the provisions of 1. above in every subcontract or purchase order over
         $10,000, so that the provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor.

         fraud and that they have not offered or received any kickbacks or inducements from any other

         transaction any payment, loan, subscription, advance, deposit of money, services or anything of more

   10. PAYMENT
       1. To Prime Contractor:


RFP E194-20029
To include Addendums 1, 2, & 3                     Page 15 of 34      Curtailment Svc Provider / Demand Response Svcs
              a. Invoices for items ordered, delivered and accepted shall be submitted by the contractor
                 directly to the payment address shown on the purchase order/contract. All invoices shall
                 show the state contract number and/or purchase order number; social security number (for
                 individual contractors) or the federal employer identification number (for proprietorships,
                 partnerships, and corporations).

              b. Any payment terms requiring payment in less than 30 days will be regarded as requiring
                 payment 30 days after invoice or delivery, whichever occurs last. This shall not affect offers
                 of discounts for payment in less than 30 days, however.

              c.   All goods or services provided under this contract or purchase order, that are to be paid for
                   with public funds, shall be billed by the contractor at the contract price, regardless of which
                   public agency is being billed.

              d. The following shall be deemed to be the date of payment: the date of postmark in all cases
                 where payment is made by mail, or the date of offset when offset proceedings have been
                 instituted as authorized under the Virginia Debt Collection Act.

              e. Unreasonable Charges. Under certain emergency procurements and for most time and
                 material purchases, final job costs cannot be accurately determined at the time orders are
                 placed. In such cases, contractors should be put on notice that final payment in full is
                 contingent on a determination of reasonableness with respect to all invoiced charges.
                 Charges which appear to be unreasonable will be researched and challenged, and that
                 portion of the invoice held in abeyance until a settlement can be reached. Upon determining
                 that invoiced charges are not reasonable, the Commonwealth shall promptly notify the
                 contractor, in writing, as to those charges which it considers unreasonable and the basis for
                 the determination. A contractor may not institute legal action unless a settlement cannot be
                 reached within thirty (30) days of notification. The provisions of this section do not relieve an
                 agency of its prompt payment obligations with respect to those charges which are not in
                 dispute (Code of Virginia, § 2.2-4363).

         2. To Subcontractors:

              a. A contractor awarded a contract under this solicitation is hereby obligated:

                          1) To pay the subcontractor(s) within seven (7) days of the contractor’s receipt of
                             payment from the Commonwealth for the proportionate share of the payment
                             received for work performed by the subcontractor(s) under the contract; or

                          2) To notify the agency and the subcontractor(s), in writing, of the contractor’s
                             intention to withhold payment and the reason.

              b. The contractor is obligated to pay the subcontractor(s) interest at the rate of one percent (1%)
                 per month (unless otherwise provided under the terms of the contract) on all amounts owed
                 by the contractor that remain unpaid seven (7) days following receipt of payment from the
                 Commonwealth, except for amounts withheld as stated in 2) above. The date of mailing of
                 any payment by U. S. Mail is deemed to be payment to the addressee. These provisions
                 apply to each sub-tier contractor performing under the primary contract. A contractor’s
                 obligation to pay an interest charge to a subcontractor may not be construed to be an
                 obligation of the Commonwealth.

         3. Each prime contractor who wins an award in which provision of a SWAM procurement plan is a
            condition to the award, shall deliver to the contracting agency or institution, on or before request
            for final payment, evidence and certification of compliance (subject only to insubstantial shortfalls
            and to shortfalls arising from subcontractor default) with the SWAM procurement plan. Final
            payment under the contract in question may be withheld until such certification is delivered and, if
            necessary, confirmed by the agency or institution, or other appropriate penalties may be
            assessed in lieu of withholding such payment.

         4. The Commonwealth of Virginia encourages contractors and subcontractors to accept electronic
            and credit card payments.

       Commonwealth that such Offeror is properly qualified to carry out the obligations of the contract and
       to provide the services and/or furnish the goods contemplated therein.

         1.       The parties may agree in writing to modify the terms, conditions, or scope of the contract.

                  contract goods or services, or within the same broad product or service categories as were
                  included in the contract award. Any increase or decrease in the price of the contract resulting
                  from such modification shall be agreed to by the parties as a part of their written agreement
                  to modify the scope of the contract.

         2.       The Purchasing Agency may order changes within the general scope of the contract at any
                  time by written notice to the contractor. Changes within the scope of the contract include, but
                  are not limited to, things such as services to be performed, the method of packing or
                  shipment, and the place of delivery or installation. The contractor shall comply with the notice
                  upon receipt, unless the contractor intends to claim an adjustment to compensation,
                  schedule, or other contractual impact that would be caused by complying with such notice, in
                  which case the contractor shall, in writing, promptly notify the Purchasing Agency of the
                  adjustment to be sought, and before proceeding to comply with the notice, shall await the
                  Purchasing Agency's written decision affirming, modifying, or revoking the prior written notice.
                  If the Purchasing Agency decides to issue a notice that requires an adjustment to
                  compensation, the contractor shall be compensated for any additional costs incurred as the
                  result of such order and shall give the Purchasing Agency a credit for any savings. Said
                  compensation shall be determined by one of the following methods:

              a. By mutual agreement between the parties in writing; or

              b. By agreeing upon a unit price or using a unit price set forth in the contract, if the work to be
                 done can be expressed in units, and the contractor accounts for the number of units of work
                 performed, subject to the Purchasing Agency’s right to audit the contractor’s records and/or
                 to determine the correct number of units independently; or

To include Addendums 1, 2, & 3                     Page 17 of 34       Curtailment Svc Provider / Demand Response Svcs
              c.   By ordering the contractor to proceed with the work and keep a record of all costs incurred
                   and savings realized. A markup for overhead and profit may be allowed if provided by the
                   contract. The same markup shall be used for determining a decrease in price as the result of
                   savings realized. The contractor shall present the Purchasing Agency with all vouchers and
                   records of expenses incurred and savings realized. The Purchasing Agency shall have the
                   right to audit the records of the Contractor as it deems necessary to determine costs or
                   savings. Any claim for an adjustment in price under this provision must be asserted by
                   written notice to the Purchasing Agency within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the
                   written order from the Purchasing Agency. If the parties fail to agree on an amount of
                   adjustment, the question of an increase or decrease in the contract price or time for
                   performance shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures for resolving disputes
                   provided by the Disputes Clause of this contract or, if there is none, in accordance with the
                   disputes provisions of the Commonwealth of Virginia Vendors Manual. Neither the existence
                   of a claim nor a dispute resolution process, litigation or any other provision of this contract
                   shall excuse the contractor from promptly complying with the changes ordered by the
                   Purchasing Agency or with the performance of the contract generally.

    16. DEFAULT
        In case of failure to deliver goods or services in accordance with the contract terms and conditions,
        the Commonwealth, after due oral or written notice, may procure them from other sources and hold
        the contractor responsible for any resulting additional purchase and administrative costs. This
        remedy shall be in addition to any other remedies which the Commonwealth may have.

    17. TAXES
        Sales to the Commonwealth of Virginia are normally exempt from State sales tax. State sales and
        use tax certificates of exemption, Form ST-12, will be issued upon request. Deliveries against this

        general style, type, character, and quality of the article desired. Any article which the public body, in
        its sole discretion, determines to be the equivalent of that specified, considering quality,
        workmanship, economy of operation, and suitability for the purpose intended, shall be accepted. The
        Offeror is responsible to clearly and specifically identify the product being offered and to provide
        sufficient descriptive literature, catalog cuts and technical detail to enable the Commonwealth to
        determine if the product offered meets the requirements of the solicitation. This is required even if
        offering the exact brand, make or manufacturer specified. Normally in competitive sealed bidding only
        the information furnished with the bid will be considered in the evaluation. Failure to furnish adequate
        data for evaluation purposes may result in declaring a bid nonresponsive. Unless the Offeror clearly
        indicates in its proposal that the product offered is an equivalent product, such proposal will be
        considered to offer the brand name product referenced in the solicitation.

    19. TRANSPORTATION AND PACKAGING
        By submitting their proposals, all Offerors certify and warrant that the price offered for FOB
        destination includes only the actual freight rate costs at the lowest and best rate and is based upon

        commercial packaging, packing and shipping containers shall be used. All shipping containers shall
        be legibly marked or labeled on the outside with purchase order number, commodity description, and
        quantity.

         the contract, it will have the following insurance coverage at the time the contract is awarded. For

         compensation insurance in accordance with §§ 2.2-4332 and 65.2-800 et seq. of the Code of Virginia.
         The bidder or offeror further certifies that the contractor and any subcontractors will maintain these
         insurance coverage during the entire term of the contract and that all insurance coverage will be
         provided by insurance companies authorized to sell insurance in Virginia by the Virginia State
         Corporation Commission.

    1. TERM
       The initial contract term will be for a period of three (3) years from the date of award. All orders and
       related documents shall survive the period of performance stated in this section until such time as all
       orders (executed prior to the expiration date of the Contract) have been completely performed.

    2. RENEWAL OF CONTRACT
       The Contract may be renewed at the sole discretion of the Commonwealth, for up to three (3)
       additional one (1) year successive periods under the terms and conditions of the original contract and
       upon mutual written agreement between the parties. Written notice of the Commonwealth’s intention
       to renew shall be given approximately ninety (90) days prior to the expiration date of each contract
       period, of the Commonwealth’s intent to renew the Contract.

    3. AUDIT
       Contractor shall retain all books, records, and other documents relative to this contract for five (5)
       years after final payment, or until audited by the Commonwealth of Virginia, whichever is sooner.
       The Commonwealth, its authorized agents, and/or state auditors shall have full access to and the
       right to examine any of said materials during said period.

    4. AWARD
       Selection shall be made of two or more offerors deemed to be fully qualified and best suited among
       those submitting proposals on the basis of the evaluation factors included in the Request for
       Proposals, including price, if so stated in the Request for Proposals. Negotiations shall be conducted
       with the offerors so selected. Price shall be considered, but need not be the sole determining factor.
       After negotiations have been conducted with each offeror so selected, the agency shall select the
       offeror which, in its opinion, has made the best proposal, and shall award the contract to that offeror.
       The Commonwealth may cancel this Request for Proposals or reject proposals at any time prior to an
       award, and is not required to furnish a statement of the reasons why a particular proposal was not
       deemed to be the most advantageous (Code of Virginia, § 2.2-4359D). Should the Commonwealth
       determine in writing and in its sole discretion that only one offeror is fully qualified, or that one offeror
       is clearly more highly qualified than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and
       awarded to that offeror. The award document will be a contract incorporating by reference all the
       requirements, terms and conditions of the solicitation and the contractor’s proposal as negotiated.

    5. CANCELLATION OF CONTRACT
       The Commonwealth reserves the right to cancel and terminate any resulting contract, in part or in
       whole, without penalty, upon 60 calendar day’s written notice to the Contractor. In the event the
       initial contract period is for more than 12 months, the resulting contract may be terminated by either
       party, without penalty, after the initial 12 months of the contract period upon 60 calendar day’s
       written notice to the other party. Any contract cancellation notice shall not relieve the Contractor of
       the obligation to deliver and/or perform on all outstanding orders issued prior to the effective date of
       cancellation.

         An agency’s employee is not authorized to revoke, alter, enlarge, relax, or release any of the
         requirements of the Contract documents. Any omission or failure on the part of the Inspector to
         disapprove or reject any work or material shall not be construed to be an acceptance of any such
         defective work or material. The Purchasing Agency will document and notify the Contract Officer of
         an omission or failure by the Contractor to perform to the standard of the manufacturer.

    6. eVA ORDERS AND CONTRACTS
       Vendors desiring to provide goods and/or services to the Commonwealth shall participate in the eVA
       Internet eprocurement solution and agree to comply with the following: If this solicitation is for a
       term contract, failure to provide an electronic catalog (price list) or index page catalog for items
       awarded will be just cause for the Commonwealth to reject your offer to terminate this contract for
       default. The format of this electronic catalog shall conform to the eVA Catalog Interchange Format
       (CIF) Specification that can be accessed and downloaded from www.eva.virginia.gov. Contractors

       or other relief, shall be submitted in writing to the Authorized User no later than sixty (60) days after
       final payment; however, written notice of the Contractor’s intention to file such claim must be given to
       the Authorized User at the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim is
       based. Pendency of claims shall not delay payment of amounts agreed due in the final payment.

         Code of Virginia nor institute legal action prior to receipt of the Commonwealth’s decision on the
         claim, unless the Commonwealth fails to render its decision within thirty (30) days. The decision of
         the Commonwealth shall be final and conclusive unless the Contractor, within six (6) months of the
         date of the final decision on the claim, invokes appropriate action under Section 2.2-4364, Code of
         Virginia, or the administrative procedure authorized by Section 2.2-4365, Code of Virginia.

         question sand need not be joined as a party to any dispute that may arise there under.

         be limited to claims for damages and Prompt Payment Act interest and, if available and warranted,
         equitable relief, all such claims to be processed pursuant to this Section. In no event shall Contractor’
         remedies include the right to terminate any Services hereunder.

       Pursuant to Code of Virginia §2.2-4308.2, any employer with more than an average of 50 employees
       for the previous 12 months entering into a contract in excess of $50,000 with any agency of the
       Commonwealth to perform work or provide services pursuant to such contract shall register and
       participate in the E-Verify program to verify information and work authorization of its newly hired
       employees performing work pursuant to such public contract. Any such employer who fails to comply
       with these provisions shall be debarred from contracting with any agency of the Commonwealth for a
       period up to one year. Such debarment shall cease upon the employer’s registration and
       participation in the E-Verify program. If requested, the employer shall present a copy of their Maintain

       their aggregate amount.

    10. MANDATORY ACCEPTANCE OF SMALL PURCHASE CHARGE CARD (SPCC)
        Purchasing charge cards offer Commonwealth of Virginia agencies and public entities the opportunity
        to streamline their procedures for procuring and paying for small dollar goods and/or
        services. Offerors responding to this solicitation should note that acceptance of payment by purchase
        card is mandatory (unless waived by DPS) within 90 calendar days of contract award.

         Charge Card Levels: The amount of data passed for each charge card payment depends on the level
         at which the charge card is established. Payment for orders issued against the contract(s) resulting
         from this solicitation must allow for the Purchase Order Number to be passed at the time of charge so
         that the Purchase Order Number is received by the card platform and passed to the Card
         provider. The levels are delineated below and vendors must establish their card account at Level 2,
         which is mandatory, or Level 3, which is optional. Information on the various levels for the Visa
         Purchase Card is indicated below.

         Level 1 - vendors provide basic charge card purchase information, including but not limited to the
         data listed below. By passing “Basic Data”, the vendor has a standard interchange cost.

         Level 2 - vendors provide additional information to the Level 1 elements, including but not limited to
         the data listed below. By passing Level 2 detail, the vendor will receive lower interchange
         costs. Level 2 is mandatory for any vendors who do business with the Commonwealth of Virginia
         and accept the Visa Card.

         Customer Code (PCO Number from eVA); and
         Vendor Tax ID

         Level 3 - vendors provide line item detail, in addition to the Level 1 and Level 2 elements, including

    11. PROPOSAL ACCEPTANCE PERIOD
        Any proposal in response to this solicitation shall be valid for 180 calendar days. At the end of the 180
        calendar days the proposal may be withdrawn at the written request of the Offeror. If the proposal is
        not withdrawn at that time it remains in effect until an award is made or the solicitation is canceled.

    12. FINANCIAL WARRANTY
        Contractor shall ensure that the prices, discounts, incentives, and other financial terms (collectively,
        the “financial deal”) applicable to purchases under this Contract is always at least as favorable to the
        purchaser as the financial deal that the Contractor or its affiliates make available to any public body
        for the same service(s) outside this Contract. Throughout the term of this Contract, if Contractor (or
        any affiliate) makes a better financial deal available to a public body in Virginia for any service(s)
        available under this Contract, Contractor shall immediately notify DGS of the details and, at DGS’s
        option, sign an amendment to this Contract, so that an equivalent financial deal for the affected
        service(s) is also available as an option under this Contract. Contractor may request exemption if the
        better financial deal was for a spot purchase, and DGS shall grant such request if DGS in good faith
        finds that the spot purchase involved special circumstances affecting cost that would make it unfair to
        apply an equivalent financial deal outside of that spot purchase. Upon DGS’s request (and annually
        on August 1), Contractor shall submit to DGS an affidavit certifying full compliance with this Section.
        Contractor (and any affiliate) shall waive any contractual or other right that inhibits any public body in
        Virginia from disclosing to DGS or others the financial terms made available to the public body and
        upon request from DGS, Contractor shall ensure that a signed confirmation of the waiver is provided
        to the public body and DGS. As used in this Section, an affiliate is any entity that controls, is
        controlled by, or is under common control with, the Contractor.

    13. PRIME CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES
        Contractor shall be responsible for completely supervising and directing the work under the Contract
        and all subcontractors that he may utilize, using his best skill and attention. Subcontractors who
        perform work under this contract shall be responsible to the Prime Contractor. Contractor agrees that
        he is as fully responsible for the acts and omissions of his Subcontractors and of persons employed
        by them as he is for the acts and omissions of his own employees.

    14. STATE CORPORATION COMMISSION IDENTIFICATION NUMBER
        Pursuant to Code of Virginia, §2.2-4311.2 subsection B, an Offeror organized or authorized to
        transact business in the Commonwealth pursuant to Title 13.1 or Title 50 is required to include in its
        proposal the identification number issued to it by the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC).
        Any Offeror that is not required to be authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth as a
        foreign business entity under Title 13.1 or Title 50 or as otherwise required by law is required to
        include in its proposal a statement describing why the Offeror is not required to be so authorized.

         Indicate the above information on the SCC Form provided. Contractor agrees that the process by
         which compliance with Titles 13.1 and 50 is checked during the solicitation stage (including without
         limitation the SCC Form provided) is streamlined and not definitive, and the Commonwealth’s use
         and acceptance of such form, or its acceptance of Contractor’s statement describing why the Offeror
         was not legally required to be authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth, shall not be
         conclusive of the issue and shall not be relied upon by the Contractor as demonstrating compliance.
         Complete ATTACHMENT C.

    15. ADDITIONAL USERS
        This procurement is being conducted on behalf of state agencies, institutions of higher education, and
        other public bodies who may be added or deleted at any time during the period of the contract. The
        addition or deletion of authorized users not specifically named in the solicitation shall be made only by
        written contract modification issued by this agency or institution and upon mutual agreement of the
        contractor. Such modification shall name the specific agency added or deleted and the effective date.
        The contractor shall not honor any order citing the resulting contract unless the ordering entity has
        been added by written contract modification.

    16. SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING AND EVIDENCE OF COMPLIANCE
        It is the goal of the Commonwealth that 42% of its purchases be made from small businesses. This
        includes discretionary spending in prime contracts and subcontracts. All bidders/offerors are required
        to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan. Unless the bidder/offeror is registered as a DSBSD-
        certified small business and where it is not practicable for any portion of the awarded contract to be
        subcontracted to other suppliers, the contractor is encouraged to offer such subcontracting
        opportunities to DSBSD-certified small businesses. This shall include DSBSD-certified women-owned
        and minority-owned businesses when they have received DSBSD small business certification. No
        bidder/offeror or subcontractor shall be considered a small business unless certified as such by the
        Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity (DSBSD) by the due date for receipt of bids or
        proposals. If small business subcontractors are used, the prime contractor agrees to report the use of
        small business subcontractors by providing the purchasing office at a minimum the following
        information: name of small business with the DSBSD certification number, phone number, total
        dollar amount subcontracted, category type (small, women-owned, or minority-owned), and type of
        product/service provided.

         Each prime contractor who wins an award in which a small business subcontracting plan is a
         condition of the award, shall deliver to the contracting agency or institution on an annual basis starting
         with the date of award, evidence of compliance (subject only to insubstantial shortfalls and to
         shortfalls arising from subcontractor default) with the small business subcontracting plan. Upon
         completion of the contract, the contractor agrees to furnish the purchasing office at a minimum the
         following information: name of firm with the DSBSD certification number, phone number, total dollar
         amount subcontracted, category type (small, women-owned, or minority-owned), and type of product
         or service provided. Payment(s) may be withheld until compliance with the plan is received and

        In the event that the contractor desires to subcontract some part of the work specified herein, the
        contractor shall furnish the purchasing agency the names, qualifications and experience of their
        proposed subcontractors. The contractor shall, however, remain fully liable and responsible for the
        work to be done by its subcontractor(s) and shall assure compliance with all requirements of the
        contract.

    19. SERVICE INFORMATION
        The offeror shall clearly and specifically identify the service being offered and enclose complete and
        detailed descriptive literature, catalog cuts and specifications with the proposal to enable the
        Commonwealth to determine if the service offered meets the requirements of the solicitation. Failure
        to do so may cause the proposal to be considered nonresponsive.

    20. PRICE ESCALATION DE-ESCALATION / PRICE ADJUSTMENTS
        Price adjustments may be permitted for changes in the contractor’s cost of providing goods and
        services under the contract. The “Services”, “All Items”, and other relevant categories of the CPI-U,
        U.S. City Average section of the Consumer Price Index of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, will be
        used as guides to evaluate requested price changes, as will other indices including Producer Price
        Index. No price increases will be authorized for 365 calendar days after the effective date of the
        contract, with the exception that the Commonwealth will consider price adjustment requests six
        months (approximately 180 calendar days) after the effective date of the contract based on changes
        in the contractor’s cost of fuel used for transportation in providing goods and services under this
        contract. Price escalation may be permitted at the end of 365 calendar days and each 365 calendar
        days thereafter and only where verified to the satisfaction of the purchasing office, with the exception
        that price escalation for the contractor’s cost of fuel used for transportation in providing goods and
        services under this contract may be permitted at the end of six months (approximately 180 calendar
        days) and each six months (approximately 180 calendar days) thereafter and only where verified to
        the satisfaction of the purchasing office. However, “across the board” price decreases are subject to
        implementation at any time and shall be immediately conveyed to the Commonwealth. Contractor
        shall give not less than 30 days advance notice of any price increase request, with documentation, to
        the purchasing office.

         The purchasing office will notify the using agencies and contractor in writing of the effective date of
         any increase which it approves. However, the contractor shall fill all purchase orders received prior to
         the effective date of the price adjustment at the old contract prices. The contractor is further advised
         that decreases which affect the cost of goods or services are required to be communicated
         immediately to the purchasing office. If the Commonwealth elects to exercise the option to renew the
         contract for additional one-year periods, the same price adjustments as stated above will apply.

    21. CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO COMMONWEALTH LOCATIONS
        The Commonwealth shall grant to Contractor personnel such access to the Commonwealth locations
        as may be necessary or appropriate for Contractor to perform its obligations under this Agreement,
