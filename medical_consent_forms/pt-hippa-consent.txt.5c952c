answer questions you may have regarding our billing procedures. Please be aware that costs for
each session may periodically differ.
PAYMENT OPTIONS: We accept personal checks, cash, VISA and MasterCard. Insurance co-
payments are due at the time of service. If we have to bill your co-pay a service will may be applied
to your bill. Any portion of your treatment that is not covered by your insurance becomes your
