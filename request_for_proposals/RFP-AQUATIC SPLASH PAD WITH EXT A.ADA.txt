     12.      GENERAL CONDITIONS
The following instructions are given for the purpose of guiding bidders in properly preparing their bids or proposals. These directions
have equal force and weight with the specifications, and strict compliance is required with all provisions.

1.   QUALIFICATIONS OF BIDDERS - No proposal will be accepted from, nor will any contract be awarded to, any person who is in
     arrears to the City of North Lauderdale, upon any debt or contract, or who has defaulted, as surety or otherwise, upon any
     obligations to the City, or who has been deemed irresponsible or unreliable to the City. The City is not required to award any jobs
     to a Contractor based solely on their bid being the lowest. Awards will be based on past performance and quality of work in
     addition to the Contractor’s RFP response.

     If selected for a project, all bidders must perform to the satisfaction of the City prior to being considered for award of additional
     contracts. Bidders whose performance is unsatisfactory will be excluded from bidding on future projects for one or more fiscal
     years. The decision to exclude a bidder and the number of years a bidder is excluded is in the sole and exclusive discretion of the
     City and is not subject to appeal.

2.   PERSONAL INVESTIGATION – Bidders shall satisfy themselves by personal investigation and by such other means as they may
     deem necessary or desirable as to the conditions affecting the proposed work and the cost. No information derived from maps,
     plans, specifications, or from the Engineer, City Manager, or their assistants or any other department of the City shall relieve the
     contractor from any risk or from fulfilling all terms of the contract. Pre-bid meetings will be held at the location in which work
     will be completed. Pre-bid meeting dates and necessity will be disclosed when listed contractors are contacted to prepare
     a quote for the services awarded. The contractor is required to conduct a full and thorough investigation of the premises prior to
     submitting a bid. It is the Contractor’s sole responsibility to determine the amount of labor and materials needed to complete all
     aspects of the project. If the pre-bid meeting is deemed mandatory and a bidder does not attend the mandatory pre-bid meeting,
     the quote will not be considered.

3.   CONE OF SILENCE - “Cone of Silence” means a prohibition on any communication regarding a particular Request for Proposals
     (RFP), Request for Qualifications (RFQ), Invitation for Bid (IFB), or other competitive solicitation between:

     Any person who seeks an award therefrom, including a potential vendor or vendor’s representative, and

     The City Commission, City Attorney, and all City employees, and any non-employee appointed to evaluate or recommend selection
     in such procurement process.

     The Cone of Silence shall not apply to communications with the Procurement Official to obtain clarification or information
     concerning the subject solicitation. Any such contact other than the Procurement Official may be considered grounds for
     disqualification. The City shall not be responsible for oral interpretations given by any City employee or its representative. For
     purposes of this section, “vendor’s representative” means an employee, partner, director, or officer of a potential vendor, or
     consultant, lobbyist, or actual or potential subcontractor or sub-consultant of a vendor, or any other individual acting through or on
     behalf of any person seeking an award.

     or any point requiring explanation must be inquired into by the bidder, in writing to the Purchasing Coordinator, at least five (5) days
     prior to the time set for the opening proposals but no later than the date specified in this proposal for acceptance of questions.
     After proposals are opened, the bidders shall abide by the decision of the City as to such interpretation.

5.   ADDENDA AND INTERPRETATIONS – No interpretations of the meaning of the plans, specifications or other contract documents
     will be made orally to any bidder. Prospective bidders must request from the Purchasing Coordinator such interpretation in writing.
     To be considered, such request must be received at least five (5) days prior to the date fixed for the opening of bids but no later
     than the date specified in this proposal for acceptance of questions. Any and all interpretations and any supplemental instructions
     will be in the form of a written addenda which, if issued, will be sent by electronic mail and posted on the City website and
     DemandStar.com not later than (3) days prior to the date fixed for the opening of bids. Failure of any bidder to receive any such
     addenda or interpretation shall not relieve any bidder from any obligation under his bid as submitted. All addenda so issued shall
     become a part of the contract document. Contractor shall verify that he has all addenda and completed the “Addendum
     Acknowledgment Form” before submitting his bid.

6.   LEGAL CONDITIONS – Bidders are notified to familiarize themselves with the provisions of the law of the State of Florida relating

    A.   The Contract Time will be extended for as many calendar days in excess of the average number of days of excusable
         inclement weather as defined in Paragraph entitled, “Excusable Inclement Weather Delays”, as the CONTRACTOR is
         specifically required under the provisions of the Technical Specifications to suspend construction operations, or as many
         calendar days as the CONTRACTOR is prevented by excusable inclement weather , or conditions resulting immediately there
         from, from proceeding with at least 75 percent of the normal labor and equipment force engaged on the WORK.

    B.   Excusable inclement weather is any weather condition, the duration of which varies in excess of the average conditions
         expected, which is unusual for the particular time and place where the WORK is to be performed, or which could not have
         been reasonable anticipated by the CONTRACTOR, as determined from U.S. Weather Bureau records for the preceding 3-
         year period. No extensions of Contract Time will be allowed for any inclement weather that could reasonably have been
         predicted from such weather records.

    C.   Should the CONTRACTOR prepare to begin work at the regular starting time at the beginning of any regular work shift on any
         day on which excusable inclement weather, or the conditions resulting from the weather, or the condition of the WORK
         prevents work from beginning at the usual starting time, and the crew is dismissed as a result thereof, the CONTRACTOR will
         not be charged for a working day whether or not conditions change thereafter during said day, and the major portion of the day
         could be considered to be suitable for such construction operations

    D.   The CONTRACTOR shall base its construction schedule upon the inclusion of the number of days of excusable inclement. No
         extension of the Contract Time due to excusable inclement weather will be considered until after the said number of days of
         excusable inclement weather has been reached. However, no reduction in Contract Time would be made if said number of
         days of excusable inclement weather is not reached.
