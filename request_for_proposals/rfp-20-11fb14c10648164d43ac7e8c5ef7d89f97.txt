                    Integrated Marketing Campaign for Montgomery County Regional Tourism Program

I PURPOSE: The intent and purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to establish a contract through competitive
negotiation for an integrated marketing campaign for the Montgomery County Regional Tourism Program. The desired active
run period for this campaign is April 2020-March 2021. This campaign plan will be built and delivered in a holistic and
cohesive manner so that visitors of Montgomery County find consistent and relevant content with which to interact regardless
of the medium on which the interaction occurs and that each are connected especially in the digital space (social media, blog,
website, etc.).


 II BACKGROUND:
 The Montgomery County, Blacksburg, Christiansburg Virginia Regional Tourism office is seeking an agency to create,
 develop, and implement an integrated marketing campaign to run from April 2020-March 2021.

 Montgomery County is one of four counties and one city that makeup Virginia’s New River Valley. It lies between the
 Alleghany and Blue Ridge Mountains in southwest Virginia. The Weldon Cooper Center estimated the population of
 Montgomery County in 2018 at 99,433 which includes two incorporated towns, Blacksburg and Christiansburg. Perhaps
 best known for Virginia Tech, Montgomery County has a mix of beautiful rural landscapes, outdoor recreation and leisure
 activities, arts and culture attractions, and a small town feel with big town amenities. The proximity of Interstate 81 and
 Highway 460 increases the desirability of this mid-Atlantic mountain destination because of accessibility, for most of the
 nation’s population, within a day’s drive.

 The Montgomery County Regional Tourism Office was created in 2011 and serves the county along with the towns of
 Blacksburg and Christiansburg. An Executive Director was hired in 2012 and the first strategic tourism plan was approved
 in May 2013. Work is currently underway for the delivery of an updated strategic tourism plan for FY 21-23. The program
 continues to build upon the “Go to town!” brand which was launched in 2015. The marketing plan includes traditional
 marketing elements such as: print, radio, broadcast, earned media, direct marketing through trade and consumer shows and
 sales missions. In the past several years, more focus has been placed on digital and online media including a website, social
 media channels, and digital advertising. This will be the first truly integrated marketing campaign in the history of the
 program.

 The program has collected three years (2016-2018) of consumer data (demographic and behavioral) from an annual visitor
 profile study conducted each year. Other accessible research is related to the economic impact of visitation to the area as
 commissioned by the Virginia Tourism Corporation, and the impact of Virginia Tech Football as conducted by the Virginia
 Tech Office of Economic Development.
