Small Business Loan
 Guaranty Program



Application Package
Small businesses create the highest number of jobs across the country, but face the greatest challenges
in accessing affordable or reasonable financing. The City of Noblesville Small Business Loan Guaranty
Program (the Program) is designed to encourage and assist business and job generation within the City
of Noblesville (the City).

In order to assist new and existing businesses, the City will participate as a guarantor as part of the
financing for qualified businesses. The financing will be underwritten in conjunction with financial
institutions within the City of Noblesville. These institutions will provide SBA and conventional loans for
small, emerging private businesses or those that desire to expand operations or increase employment
within the City. The City’s guaranty will be utilized to ‘bridge the gap’ between conventional
underwriting standards or add necessary support to facilitate the availability of capital to these
businesses.

The Program will require the City to establish a liability ‘threshold’ which will be available until such time
as the limit has been reached. As loans which are funded under the Program are amortized or repaid in
full, the guaranty fund will become available to new borrowers. The City reserves its rights to cancel the
Program at any time.

Through the Program the City’s expectations are to provide an additional source of capital for
businesses which can be leveraged with funding available through the private sector market. The
primary focus of the Program is to increase new job creation within the City and to support the local
business community.

The administrative responsibilities for this Program will be housed in the Economic Development
Department of the City. The Loan Guaranty Review Committee (LGRC) will be established as part of the
Program and chaired by the Department’s designee. The LGRC will be responsible for reviewing the
Program applications (with all necessary addenda) and rendering decisions on the City’s participation in
any given loan transaction.

                        Loan Guaranty Review and Approval Procedure

The City of Noblesville and the LGRC will make every effort to adhere to the guidelines
described herein. However, each individual loan application may present special circumstances
which require additional information or steps for processing.

STEP 1:
The applicant will first approach a local (located within the City of Noblesville) Lender to apply
for a loan. The lender may either deny or grant the loan subject to the applicant obtaining
approval for participation in the Program. Each application is submitted to The City and initially
reviewed by the Economic Development Department to determine if it satisfies the objectives
and criteria of the Program. A $200 processing fee will be paid by the applicant once it is
determined the application will move on to the formal review committee.

STEP 2:
If the program objectives and criteria are satisfied, and available funds exist to guaranty the
loan, the LGRC will review the loan application in its entirety at their next scheduled meeting.
The LGRC will notify the applicant and the lender as to their findings by mail and when
requested by electronic mail (email).

STEP 3:
If the LGRC recommends the guaranty, they will issue to the Borrower and the lender a formal
Commitment Letter informing them of the terms and conditions of the guaranty. The Borrower
will be required to sign and return the Commitment Letter within thirty (30) days. The approval
process will then move to the Common Council who may approve the Guaranty Agreement and
recommend signature of all documents necessary by the Board of Public Works and Safety.
