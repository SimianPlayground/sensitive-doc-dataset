SECTION D - SIGNATURE AND DATE
The Policy Owner(s) warrants that the above-referenced policy withdrawal or loan is not subject to any prior agreements, contractual
obligations, legal proceedings or court/administrative orders, including but not limited to divorce or bankruptcy proceedings
("Obligations"), which restrict, limit or otherwise prohibit such withdrawals and loans as contemplated. The Policy Owner(s) acknowledges
and agrees that in the event any obligations become known subsequent to the above-referenced withdrawal or loan being made, which
if then-known to the Company, would have caused the Company not to disburse the withdrawal or loan on the policy (or not to disburse
the withdrawal or loan without the consent of a party other than the Policy Owner(s)), the withdrawal or loan, plus interest, will become
immediately due and payable to the Company by the Policy Owner(s), and the Policy Owner(s) shall indemnify and the Company harmless
from any and all losses associated with the withdrawal or loan, including costs of recovery and reasonable attorney fees.
You and the Internal Revenue Service will be provided with an informational tax form after the close of the calendar year. A withdrawal
of any type, before age 59 1/2, may subject you to an IRS penalty tax.

IRS Certification: Under penalties of perjury, I certify that: 1. The number shown on this form is my correct taxpayer identification number
(or I am waiting for a number to be issued to me), and 2. I am not subject to backup withholding because: (a) I am exempt from backup
withholding (enter exempt payee code*, if applicable: _____ ), OR (b) I have not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that
I am subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified me that I am no
longer subject to backup withholding, and 3. I am a U.S. citizen or other U.S. person*, and 4. The FATCA code(s) entered on this form (if
any) indicating that I am exempt from FATCA reporting is correct (enter exemption from FATCA reporting code, if applicable: _____ ).
**Certification instructions. You must cross out item 2 above if you have been notified by the IRS that you are currently subject to backup
withholding because you have failed to report all interest and dividends on your tax return. For contributions to an individual retirement
arrangement (IRA) and, generally, payments other than interest and dividends, you are not required to sign the certification, but you
must provide your correct ITIN. *See General Instructions provided on the IRS Form W-9 available from IRS.gov. ** If you can complete
a Form W-9 and you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien, FATCA reporting may not apply to you. Please consult your own tax advisors.

The Internal Revenue Service does not require your consent to any provision of this document other than the certifications required
to avoid backup withholding.
