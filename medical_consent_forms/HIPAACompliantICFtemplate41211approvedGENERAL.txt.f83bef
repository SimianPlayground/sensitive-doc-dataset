 7   CONFIDENTIALITY AND YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH
 8   INFORMATION (PHI)
 9   (Section Required by the HIPAA Privacy Rule – 45 CFR 164.508)
10
11   Note: If applicable, this section refers to your child’s participation in the study and
12         your child’s protected health information.
13
14   A. Purpose of Authorization
15   The HIPAA Privacy Rule is a federal law about privacy (45 CFR Part 160 and
16   Subparts A and E of Part 164). It explains how to guard the privacy of your
17   protected health information, also called PHI. This authorization defines who can
18   use and disclose your PHI for the study and why.
19
20   You must sign this form if you want to be in the study. When you sign the form,
21   you give permission for the use and disclosure of your PHI for the study. If you do
22   not give this authorization you will not be able to be in the study.
23
24   B. Use and Disclosure of the Protected Health Information (PHI)
25   As part of the study, you will have testing and examinations and/or will answer
26   questions. Your study results will be given to the Jaeb Center for Health Research.
27   The Jaeb Center is the coordinating center for the study. It is located in Tampa,
28   Florida.
29
30   There are other people in the study. They are from this doctor’s office and/or from
31   other doctors’ offices. Their study results will also be given to the Jaeb Center. A
32   code number will go with the study results instead of the study participant name,
33   address, telephone number, or social security number.
34
35   This doctor’s office will not disclose study results that have a direct personal
36   identifier except as explained later in this authorization or when required by law.
37   Name, address, telephone number, and social security number are examples of
38   direct personal identifiers. The Jaeb Center and this doctor’s office will guard the
39   privacy of your study PHI.

40
41   Study results may appear in medical journals and be shared at scientific meetings.
42   No one will disclose the identity of a study participant in a medical journal or at a
43   scientific meeting. Your records will be confidential. They will be kept according
44   to the requirements of federal and state law.
45
46   It is very important that your study doctor’s office has your current contact
47   information. You will be informed of the study results when they are made public.
48
49   C. Authorized Recipients and Users
50   The following people may receive, see, use, and disclose your study PHI:
51      1. The people who work for this doctor’s office
52      2. The people who work for the Jaeb Center
53      3. The scientific investigators who help run the study
54      4. Any review board that oversees human investigations rules for your doctor’s
55         office
56      5. Any federal agency that oversees clinical trials
57      6. {List other entity(ies) and when appropriate include a short description of
58         the information to be received.}
59
60   In most cases the information will have a code number with it instead of your
61   name, address, telephone number, or social security number.
62
63   There are some situations where the information will not have a code number with
64   it and the above persons or people outside the doctor’s office who assist in your
65   care may have access to your study PHI. For example, they may need to see it if
66   you have an adverse (unfavorable) event that is related to the study. If it is
67   reviewed by any of these people, they may need to review your whole medical
68   record.
69
70   {Other Considerations
71   Add information here:
72           if contact information will be provided to the Jaeb Center and subjects
73            will be contacted directly [; emphasize that contact information is
74            separate from the research data];
75           if others such as an optician, LensCrafters, etc. will receive additional
76            PHI, etc.}

                                                     Informed Consent Form

 79   The people named above (see section C) may receive, see, use, and disclose your
 80   study PHI. They need it to help run the study and to analyze the results. They may
 81   also need it to meet the requirements of federal or state law.
 82
 83   This doctor’s office will provide the study PHI to the Jaeb Center and to the other
 84   people named above as needed and/or requested by them. The study PHI will
 85   typically be provided to them via the Jaeb Center, because it is the coordinating
 86   center.
 87
 88   E. Potential for Redisclosure
 89   The HIPAA Privacy Rule may not require the people named above (see section C)
 90   to guard the privacy of your study PHI. It is possible that they may give it out
 91   again.
 92
 93   F. Cancellation of authorization
 94   You may stop your permission for the use and disclosure of your study PHI at any
 95   time. You need to contact your study doctor and give him/her a notice of
 96   cancellation in writing.
 97
 98   When you cancel your permission or when you withdraw from the study directly,
 99   you are no longer part of the study. No new information about you will be
100   gathered for the study except when it is on an adverse (unfavorable) event that is
101   related or potentially related to the study. If one happens, your entire medical
102   record may need to be reviewed.
103
104   The Jaeb Center will receive all the information that has already been collected for
105   the study up to the time of cancellation or withdrawal. Any new information about
106   any adverse (unfavorable) event that is related or potentially related to the study
107   will also be sent to the Jaeb Center.
108
109   G. 50 Year Expiration Date and Indefinite Expiration Date
110   Some of your study PHI does not have a code number with it. Your permission for
111   the use and disclosure of this PHI lasts 50 years from the date of your signature or
112   until the end of the study, whichever is sooner. The end of the study is when no
113   one has to monitor the study anymore, the funding agency data analyses are done,
114   and the primary articles are accepted for publication.
115
116   The rest of your study PHI does have a code number with it. When it is collected,
117   it becomes a research report. Your permission for the use and disclosure of these
