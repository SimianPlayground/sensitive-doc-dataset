 EMPLOYEE SIGNATURE (REQUIRED)
 I certify that all expenses listed above are eligible for reimbursement under Section Code 213(d) and in accordance with my Plan and were
 incurred during a period while I was covered by my employers plan. These expenses have not and are not reimbursable under any other health
 plan. All over‐the‐counter drugs and medications must be accompanied by a doctor’s prescription.

 refunded after the claim has been processed, these monies are owed back to the plan via personal payment or the provider may issue a credit
 back to the benefits card.
