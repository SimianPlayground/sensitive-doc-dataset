REQUIRING SIGNATURES FOR AN APPLICATION & GUARANTORS

Regulation B prohibits a lender from requiring the signature of non-applicant parties to become
liable for debts (i.e. spouses)

Regulation B 1002.7 says: (d) Signature of spouse or other person—(1) Rule for qualified
applicant. Except as provided in this paragraph, a creditor shall not require the signature of
an applicant’s spouse or other person, other than a joint applicant, on any credit
instrument if the applicant qualifies under the creditor’s standards of creditworthiness
for the amount and terms of the credit requested. A creditor shall not deem the
submission of a joint financial statement or other evidence of jointly held assets as an
application for joint credit.

However, a creditor can require non-applying parties to sign any security document that is
needed to perfect an interest in pledged collateral.

So…Mrs. Smith applies (as the sole applicant) for a loan secured by an interest in her primary
dwelling. The primary dwelling in jointly owned with Mr. Smith. This is how the application,
note, and security agreement (mortgage) would be signed:

    Mrs. Smith signs the application, note, and security agreement (mortgage)
    Mr. Smith only signs the security agreement (mortgage)

When can additional parties be requested to apply?

Here’s what it says in Regulation B 1002.7(d)(5) about additional parties:
(5) Additional parties. If, under a creditor’s standards of creditworthiness, the personal
liability of an additional party is necessary to support the credit requested, a creditor may
request a cosigner, guarantor, endorser, or similar party. The applicant’s spouse may
serve as an additional party, but the creditor shall not require that the spouse be the additional
party.

The commentary to this section says:

Paragraph 7(d)(5)

1. Qualifications of additional parties. In establishing guidelines for eligibility of guarantors,
cosigners, or similar additional parties, a creditor may restrict the applicant’s choice of
additional parties but may not discriminate on the basis of sex, marital status, or any
other prohibited basis. For example, the creditor could require that the additional party
live in the creditor’s market area.

   1. If the applicant lacks sufficient separate property, a creditor must value applicant's interest in
      jointly owned property.
   2. The requirement for the guarantee must be based on the guarantor's relationship with the
      business. A creditor must evaluate the financial circumstances of the partners, etc. before
      determining if the joint property owner's signature would be required.
   3. Follow the chart regarding individual unsecured or secured credit.
   4. For example, an instrument to create a valid lien, pass clear title, waive inchoate rights or assign
      earnings. A creditor may require both property owners to sign the credit and security agreements,
      if required under state law

GUARANTORS

Regulation B addresses the question of guarantors and spousal guarantees in the commentary to
1002.7 (rules concerning the extension of credit)

Paragraph 7(d)(6)
1. Guarantees. A guarantee on an extension of credit is part of a credit transaction and
therefore subject to the regulation. A creditor may require the personal guarantee of the
partners, directors, or officers of a business, and the shareholders of a closely held
corporation, even if the business or corporation is creditworthy. The requirement must be
based on the guarantor’s relationship with the business or corporation, however, and
not on a prohibited basis. For example, a creditor may not require guarantees only for
women-owned or minority-owned businesses. Similarly, a creditor may not require
guarantees only of the married officers of a business or the married shareholders of a closely
held corporation.

2. Spousal guarantees. The rules in § 1002.7(d) bar a creditor from requiring the signature
of a guarantor’s spouse just as they bar the creditor from requiring the signature of an
applicant’s spouse. For example, although a creditor may require all officers of a closely
held corporation to personally guarantee a corporate loan, the creditor may not
automatically require that spouses of married officers also sign the guarantee. If an
evaluation of the financial circumstances of an officer indicates that an additional signature is
necessary, however, the creditor may require the signature of another person in appropriate
circumstances in accordance with § 1002.7(d)(2).

REGULATION B – TO DO AND NOT TO DO
DO:
  1.   Document WHEN the application was first received by the bank.
  2.   SUGGESTION: GET A DATE STAMP AND USE IT!!
  3.   Document WHEN the information was fully completed for the type of credit requested.
  4.   SUGGESTION: Use a “comment log” that documents the application process
  5.   If the information was incomplete, document the efforts made to obtain the required
       information.
   6. Document HOW the application was received (in-person, phone, by mail, e-mail,
       internet)
   7. Document WHO applied. Was it a joint application? Were both applicants physically
       present? If it was a phone application, did you ASK if it was a joint application? A
       person’s intent to be a joint applicant must be evidenced at the time of application. (Per
       commentary to Reg B 1002.7(d)(1)#3) AND “signatures on a joint financial statement
       affirming the veracity of information are not sufficient to establish intent to apply for
       joint credit.” Translation – have them initial at the top of the model applications that they
       wish to jointly apply for credit!!
   8. Document WHAT the application was for – was it a secured or unsecured request?
   9. Document the lien position for dwelling secured loans. If it is a first-lien, regardless of
       consumer or business purpose, follow the appraisal copy requirements. Provide the
       appraisal notice, provide the copy of the appraisal, follow the timing rules before closing
       the loan or opening the account, as applicable follow the waiver options.
   10. Do use the model application forms from Regulation B.
   11. If REAL ESTATE is involved, determine what other regulations may apply. IF THIS IS
       A CONSUMER PURPOSE REQUEST it IS subject to HMDA, RESPA, Reg Z early
       disclosures, new ABILITY TO REPAY rules, appraisal copy rules, provide Home
       Ownership Counseling list for consumer purpose loans. Remember to complete Flood
       determination and provide notice if the collateral is in a SFHDA, credit score disclosures,
       and the SAFE Act MLO identification information?
   12. Collect the monitoring information, if required. Document if the applicant(s) declined to
       provide the information for an in-person application and that the lender noted it based on
       visual observation or surname.
   13. Document any CHANGES to the original credit request (amount, collateral, etc.)
   14. Notify the applicant(s) of the credit decision within 30 days of a completed application.

DON’T:
  1. Don’t give the applicant a “decision” about their chances of qualifying for a loan during a
     loan inquiry. Simply state the general qualifications for that type of loan and encourage
     them to submit an application for full consideration.
  2. Don’t require non-applicant parties to become liable for the debt (i.e. spouses)
  3. Don’t forget to REQUEST monitoring information (when required) in a phone
     application. Don’t forget to document joint intent at the TIME of application.

REG B CHEAT SHEET APPRAISAL COPY RULES
                           REG B APPRAISAL COPY RULE

Changes to Reg B   §1002.04 and §1002.14 are amended
When?              Effective date was January 18, 2014
What’s new?        This change requires a creditor to give an applicant a copy of all appraisals
                   and written valuations that were developed in connection with a credit
                   application that is secured by a first lien on a dwelling.
Timing             The copy must be provided 3 business days prior to closing for a closed-
                   end request or account opening for open-end credit, whichever is earlier.
Waiver             The applicant can waive the 3-day rule, but the lender must still provide the
                   copy at or before closing or account-opening.
Loan doesn’t       The creditor must still provide the copies no later than 30 days after
close              determining that consummation won’t happen or the account isn’t opened.
Consumer only      NO – this will also apply to business purpose first-lien loan applications
What definitions   Dwelling still means a residential structure of one to four units, whether or
are new?           not attached to real property. Dwelling does not include a “motor vehicle”
                   (i.e. cars, trucks, motorcycles, recreational boats & marine equipment,
                   motor homes, campers)
                   Valuation – means any estimate of the value of a dwelling developed in
                   connection with an application for credit.
Timing and               The disclosure of “Right to Receive a Copy of Appraisals” must be
disclosures                 provided 3 business days from the application date
                         A copy of each appraisal or written valuation must be given
                            promptly on completion or 3 business days before closing for a
                            closed-end request or account opening for open-end credit;
                            whichever is earlier unless there is a waiver.
What is the new
disclosure form?   C-9 has been revised; it’s “Sample Disclosure of Right to Receive a
                   Copy of Appraisals.” The “Integrated Disclosures” will have an
                   appraisal notice for covered CONSUMER LOANS. Continue to use
                   the C-9 Disclosure for FIRST LIEN DWELLING SECURED
                   BUSINESS APPLICATIONS!
What can go             Copy is required even if the application is incomplete, denied,
wrong?                    withdrawn, offered but not accepted. This is not just for closed
                          loans.
                        Can’t charge the applicant for the cost of the copy; you CAN
                          charge for the appraisal
                        Can be provided electronically, but only if E-SIGN is followed
                          (unless application was electronic)
                        This applies to business loans if there is a first-lien on a dwelling
                        Be careful with waiver documentation for the 3 business day
                          timing; the commentary says the waiver can be done orally or in
                          writing. There are restrictions for Non-QM HPML appraisals; they
                          have their own set of rules



Compliance for Commercial Loans Secured by Real Estate –Take-Away Tools                Page 16
                          Get the waiver at least 3 business days before closing unless is only
                             for a copy of an appraisal/valuation that was changed for clerical
                             reasons from a previous version that was given within the timing
                             requirements.
                          At the time of application the loan was going to be a subordinate
                             lien and it’s later determined that it WILL be a first lien, the notice
                             must be mailed or delivered no later than 3 business days after
                             determining the first lien position
Who knew?            This change actually REDUCES the scope of appraisal coverage to first
                     lien applications secured by a dwelling. Copies MUST be provided under
                     this new rule; the “old” rule gave the applicant a right to request a copy or
                     the lender routinely provided copies.
Bottom line          Provide a notice and provide a copy within the time frames

         Form C-9—Sample Disclosure of Right to Receive a Copy of Appraisals.
We may order an appraisal to determine the property's value and charge you for this appraisal.
We will promptly give you a copy of any appraisal, even if your loan does not close.

You can pay for an additional appraisal for your own use at your own cost

STEP BY STEP HMDA CONTROLS
There are twenty-six data fields on the HMDA LAR. The only way to avoid compliance
headaches with this complicated regulation is to have adequate internal control procedures to
collect and verify the data.
                     HMDA LAR DATA FIELDS AND CONTROL METHODS
                         BEST PRACTICES FOR FILE DOCUMENTATION

   1. Create a HMDA file folder for each LAR entry that can be verified by a person or team that is
      knowledgeable in HMDA procedures. Make these files available to the regulator during a
      compliance exam so the HMDA integrity review for accuracy will be limited to HMDA
      information.
   2. Label EACH data field in this file with the numbers that correspond to the HMDA LAR (1-26)
   3. Highlight each data field on the source document next to the number of the data field.
   4. Perform a second review of the data; this can be done by an outside party or audit staff.
      Depending on the risk factors (past HMDA violations, rapid growth, decentralized processing,
      etc) the second file review may be a percentage of the LAR entries or it may require 100%
      coverage.
   5. Sign-up for the FFIEC e-mail alerts for HMDA; maintain a current copy of the “HMDA Getting
      it Right Guide”
   6. Revised written procedures as needed when changes are made to HMDA or deficiencies are
      noted in audits and exams.
   7. Train new employees; provide refresher training for all lending employees. Annual training is
      not required but should be done in accordance with exam and audit findings.
     DATA FIELD                  CONTROL METHOD                             COMMENTS
   1. Application or         Loan number if originated;        Do not use social security number or

SAMPLE FAIR LENDING POLICY
A bank cannot discriminate on a prohibited basis regarding any aspect of a credit transaction.
You “discriminate” whenever you treat any person less favorably than others. This prohibition
applies to all dealings between customers and loan applicants and the bank, including the
following:

    •   Application procedures
    •   Information requirements

                          Sample Fair Lending Policy for ABC Bank

ABC Bank is committed to serving the credit needs of our entire service market. It is our policy
to respond to all applicants for credit without regard to any of the factors enumerated below. We
believe that doing so is basic to good business practice and to our own long-term vitality.

A. Disparate treatment

ABC Bank will not tolerate illegal discrimination by any of our officers, employees, or agents
against any current or potential customer on the basis of the following characteristics
(“prohibited bases”)

   Race
   Color
   National origin
   Sex
   Marital status
   Age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract)
   The fact that all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program.
   The fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit
    Protection Act or any similar state law designated by the Federal Reserve Board.
   Discrimination is also prohibited on the following two bases regarding any aspect of housing
    credit:
             Handicap
             Familial status (having children under the age of 18)

Discrimination is prohibited if it is based on any of the enumerated factors in relation to any
customer, to an officer of a business, or to any individuals with whom a customer is affiliated or
with whom he or she associates. This means, for example, that no discrimination is permitted
against a customer because of that person’s personal or business dealings with members of a
certain religion.

B. Disparate Impact
ABC Bank is committed to assuring that its policies and practices do not have an adverse effect
on customers or applicants on a prohibited basis. Such a result is not only unfair to the applicants
involved, but can deprive the bank of valuable business it might otherwise obtain. All lending-
related policies and procedures (credit and appraisal standards, loan underwriting, processing,
and servicing procedures, and so forth) will be reviewed on a regular basis. The goal of this
review is to assure that there are no standards and practices present that amount to arbitrary or
unreasonable measures of creditworthiness or treatment, and that may have an unintentional
discriminatory effect.

C. Prevention and detection
ABC Bank will strive to prevent illegal discrimination from happening and will endeavor to
detect it if it should occur. We will follow a strategy that will consist of training for all loan and
customer-service personnel, a second review program for applications slated for denial, and a
self-assessment mechanism.

1. Training. All loan and customer-service personnel will be provided with training appropriate
to their job description and responsibilities in fair lending issues. This will include information
regarding both technical requirements that come into play, as well as the more substantive and
often subtle issues related to unintentional discrimination and quality of assistance.

2. Second Review. A program of taking a second look at all or a random statistically
representative sample of applications from low- to moderate-income individuals that are slated
for denial by the front-line loan officer or underwriter will be established. A loan officer(s) will
conduct the second review or others experienced in credit underwriting who have no
involvement with the original application and underlying transaction.

The purpose of the second review will not be to conclude if a denial is justified, but to determine
if there is some way that the loan can be made. The second review ultimately will be applied for
all types of consumer and small business/farm credit.

3. Self-Assessment. The fair lending self-assessment program will include traditional monitoring
and audit processes.

D. Technical compliance
The compliance officer, working with the bank’s loan personnel and management, and legal
counsel, will assure that we meet the procedural requirements of the fair lending laws and
regulations, including:

1. Written Applications/Monitoring Information. Any application taken by ABC Bank must
be in writing if it is for credit that is primarily to finance or refinance the purchase of a dwelling
that is, or will be the applicant’s primary residence and is secured by the dwelling.

In addition, we must collect the following information about each applicant for such a loan: race
or national origin; sex; marital status; age; and any additional data required by our regulator’s
fair housing regulation.

2. Proper Notification. Applicants for credit must be notified of the action being taken on their
applications within 30 calendar days after we receive an application. Any written notice of
adverse action (denial or counteroffer) must include: our name and address; a statement of the
action taken; a statement of the specific reasons for the action (or of the applicant’s right to
request the reasons); and the standard Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) notice found in
Regulation B (including the name and address of the federal agency that administers our
compliance with the ECOA).

Any written notice of incompleteness must include statements requesting the information needed
from the customer; specifying a reasonable period of time or the date by which we must receive
the missing information; and noting that failure to provide the requested information will result
in no further consideration being given to the application.

3. Lobby Notice. The current Equal Housing Lender poster must be posted prominently in all of
our offices as required by 12 CFR §701.31.

E. Responsibilities

1. Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will formally adopt our fair lending policy
statement. In addition, the Board will remain informed of our fair lending performance through
periodic evaluation of internal and agency examination reports. The Board will hold ABC Bank
personnel accountable for our fair lending performance.

2. Senior Management. The chief executive officer and other senior managers of ABC Bank
will assure that an appropriate fair lending program is established to comply with the policy
stated above. Senior management will also assure that a positive fair lending culture exists in
ABC Bank, beginning with their example and behavior.
Senior management will hold ABC Bank personnel accountable for fair lending performance.

3. Compliance Officer. ABC Bank’s compliance officer will monitor our fair lending
performance through the regular compliance review process. The compliance officer will report
to the Board on a regular basis regarding our fair lending performance.

4. Other Staff. All personnel are expected to cooperate with and support our fair lending
compliance efforts. Staff will be held accountable for any lack of cooperation that weakens our
fair lending performance, as reflected in internal audits, agency examinations, and/or customer
complaints.

F. Compliance management

The compliance officer will assure the following steps are taken:

1. Training. The compliance officer will establish and conduct the training necessary to assure
our compliance with this policy and the underlying laws and regulations. Such training will
emphasize the role of every employee in serving all customers and potential customers with
fairness, courtesy, friendliness, and responsiveness. It will assure that all personnel understand
their obligation with respect to posting the Equal Housing Lender poster.

Training will also assure that all loan and other personnel understand our fair lending obligations
and how to fulfill them, including encouraging applications from anyone inquiring about a loan.

2. Advertising/Promotional Materials. All credit advertisements, lobby notices, brochures,
signs and other promotional materials will be reviewed prior to printing, to assure their
compliance with fair lending. All obsolete, noncompliant promotional materials are promptly
destroyed or altered, to assure that only correct ones are used. No advertisements or promotional
materials will imply or express any preference for, or exclusion of, any applicants on a
prohibited basis.

3. Complaints. The compliance officer will regularly review complaints received by ABC Bank
for any indication of problems that could lead to examiner criticism of, or civil liability for, our
fair lending performance. The compliance officer will recommend to management action to
address any significant complaints.

4. Fair Lending Audits. ABC Bank’s auditors (or another third party not responsible for the
compliance program) will conduct an annual audit of our fair lending performance. The audit
will evaluate ABC Bank’s performance with respect to this policy and to the fair lending laws
and regulations. An integral part of this audit will be testing for substantive illegal
discrimination.

The audit report will be submitted to management and the Board. In addition, the compliance
officer will make recommendations based on the audit results for changes in our program or its
execution.
