Authorization
I verify that the patient and physician information contained in this enrollment form is complete
and accurate to the best of my knowledge and that I have prescribed Axumin based on my
professional independent judgment of medical necessity and it will be used as directed. I certify
that I have received the appropriate permission from the patient and met any other applicable
requirements imposed under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
and/or state law needed to release the above information to Blue Earth Diagnostic and its agents
for the purposes of verifying the patient’s insurance coverage, on my patient’s behalf, and
providing information on prior authorization and/or appeals for denials of claims. I authorize the
Axumin Reimbursement Support Helpline Program to perform a preliminary assessment of
insurance and benefit verification for the above-named patient, and I further authorize and
request that the Program provide to me any and all information necessary for completing a
Letter of Medical Necessity as may be required as a result of such insurance benefit verification.

Patient Authorization
I understand that I must complete this application or provide the signed consent before I can
receive assistance through the Axumin Reimbursement Support Helpline Program
(the “Program”). I hereby authorize my healthcare providers, pharmacies, and health plan(s) to
disclose my personal health information (“PHI”), including information related to my medical
condition and treatment, and all information provided on this patient enrollment form to Blue
Earth Diagnostics, the manufacturer of Axumin, and to its agents and the administrator of the
Program (collectively, the “Recipients”). I further authorize the Recipients to use and disclose
my PHI for the purposes of establishing my eligibility for benefits from my health plan or other
programs, providing appropriate educational and reimbursement support, and communicating
with my healthcare providers, and for Blue Earth Diagnostics’ internal business purposes,
including quality control and compliance.

I understand that signing this authorization is voluntary and that if I were to refuse to sign, that
would not affect my eligibility for health plan benefits or ability to obtain treatment by my
healthcare providers. I also understand, however, that if I refuse to sign, I will not have access to
the services offered by the Program. I also understand that if I sign this authorization, I can
cancel it at any time by notifying Blue Earth Diagnostics in writing at
reimbursement@blueearthdx.com. Upon receiving my notice of cancellation, Blue Earth
Diagnostics would stop using this authorization to access, use, or disclose my PHI, but the
cancellation would not apply to any PHI that had already been used or disclosed pursuant to this
authorization. I understand that information that I authorize to be disclosed hereunder may be
re-disclosed and no longer protected by certain federal or state privacy laws.

This authorization will expire two (2) years after the date it is signed below. I have read this
authorization or have had it explained to me. I understand that I will receive a copy of this
authorization after I sign it.
