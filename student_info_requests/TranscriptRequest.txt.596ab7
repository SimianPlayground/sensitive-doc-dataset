         Emailed and Faxed transcripts are considered to be unofficial transcripts. An official transcript is one that is
         received in a sealed, envelope that has the official UHV stamp on the envelope.


• Official transcript requests will be mailed to the address designated on the request form. If a complete, legible address is not listed,
the request will not be processed.

• The last four digits of the student’s social security number will appear on the official transcript for the purpose of identifying and
matching records when a student transfers courses to another university or college.

• A student’s transcript only includes the academic record accumulated at University of Houston-Victoria. Official copies of
transcripts from other institutions cannot be furnished.

• The first three (3) transcript requests are provided at no charge. A fee of $4 per transcript may be assessed for additional
transcripts. Additional fees may be incurred for expedited shipping. The University reserves the right to reinstate any/all fees at any
time, and the Registrar has authority to deny unreasonable requests.

• Current UHV students can view an unofficial copy of your transcript online through MyUHV.

• Transcript requests are processed 2 – 3 times a week and requests must be received no later than 3 p.m. the day prior to
processing. In the event that you have a negative financial service indicator (stop/hold) on your record, your request can not be
processed and you will be contacted at the email address you have listed on your request form.


PLEASE NOTE: Peak periods may require additional processing time (i.e. registration, end of semester, etc.).
