Fax Verification is available by calling 888-438-6105 and following the appropriate prompts. The Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
system can verify faxes received within the last 30 days.

Letter of Medical Necessity (LOMN) is additional documentation needed when an item normally not considered eligible is needed
to treat a specific medical condition. This letter would need to be completed by your provider stating which service or item is needed
and for what type of condition. If you are not sure if a service or item will be covered, please contact UMR customer service.

Limitations on Reimbursement of Over-the-Counter Supplies (Stockpiling) will be followed. You will only be reimbursed
for a reasonable quantity of an eligible over-the-counter medical care expense as determined by the plan administrator under the Plan
(i.e., 10 boxes of band aids in one month would not be reasonable).

Payments are issued once the total reimbursement amount reaches your plan’s $5.00 check minimum.
