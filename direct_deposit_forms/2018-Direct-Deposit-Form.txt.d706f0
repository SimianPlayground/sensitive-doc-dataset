I hereby authorize ADP to deposit any amounts owed me, as instructed by my employer, by initiating credit entries to my account at the financial
institution (hereinafter "Bank") indicated on this form. Further, I authorize Bank to accept and to credit entries indicated by ADP to my account. In
the event that ADP deposits funds erroneously into my account, I authorize ADP to debit my account for an amount not to exceed the original
