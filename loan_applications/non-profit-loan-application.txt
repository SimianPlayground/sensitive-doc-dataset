Dear Nonprofit Applicant:

Thank you for visiting our website and downloading this nonprofit loan application. We look forward to
working with you to find financing that best meets your organization’s needs. To make this process
easier, please take a moment to read the following information about the application process and
paperwork.

How does Self-Help decide if my organization qualifies for a loan?
We review the following items to decide if you qualify for a loan. If we spot weakness in one area of the
application, we are willing to look for strength in another area. If we spot a weakness in more than one
area, though, we may not be able to offer a loan at this time.

     •    Management – do you have a successful financial track record and strong, stable leadership?
     •    Cash flow – does your income cover your expenses? If not, you must have enough equity or net
          assets/fund balance to cover foreseeable losses.
     •    Collateral – what collateral is available to secure the loan? Collateral is especially important if
          your organization is not strong financially or is a start-up.
     •    Equity – does your organization have positive net assets/fund balance?
     •    Credit history – does your organization meet credit obligations responsibly?

What forms do I submit to apply for a loan?
A checklist of items you need to submit to us is on page 2 of this package. Most of the forms you need
to submit are in the attached pages. A few items we will need, such as your organization’s tax returns,
are not forms in this package. Just follow the checklist and you’ll stay organized.

What do I do when I have my application package completed?
Please mail or deliver your completed application package to the nearest Self-Help branch. Self-Help’s
offices and their addresses are listed below.

What should I make sure not to forget?
Sign all forms where indicated. The items requiring your signature include the personal financial
statement, the commercial loan application form, and tax returns. Also, before you mail your completed
loan application package to us, make a copy of the application package to keep for yourself. We keep all
application materials sent to us and cannot return submitted forms.

If you have any questions about this package, the forms, or the application process, please feel free to
contact the nearest Self-Help branch.

                              FINANCING FOR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

At Self-Help, we strive to be experts in nonprofit finance. We are a lender, but also a resource on other
funding and financing options available to nonprofits in North Carolina and beyond. By funding, we mean
grants and in-kind gifts; by financing, we mean debt financing. As a fellow member of the nonprofit
community, we want to help you find the best financing available. The following list covers sources of
funding that are available in the state of North Carolina and that are generally available to all nonprofits.
Different sectors (housing, child care, the arts) and different regions of the state may have specialized options
that are not listed here. We encourage you to give us feedback on this list and let us know of additional
resources that are available to nonprofits.

                                          Funding and Financing Sources

Conventional Banks: We have found a wide range of interest in the banking community in lending to
nonprofits. Some institutions and individual bankers see it as an important part of their community
responsibilities. Others see it as a great “business” market for them, while some need educating. Anything
is possible, but we generally see stronger bank interest in lending to nonprofits when:

•    the nonprofit has developed a relationship with the lender by maintaining deposit accounts at the bank
     and/or inviting bank staff to serve as board members or in other capacities,
•    the nonprofit has individuals willing to co-sign on the loan and/or has a strong financial track record, and
•    the bank has an active Community Reinvestment Program.1

Tax-Exempt Financing: Certain projects, by virtue of their charitable/public interest nature, are eligible for
financing that allows the financier to be exempted from paying taxes on the interest earned from the
financing. This can result in rates that are approximately 2% lower than comparable taxable financing.
Because of the hefty up front cost of arranging the financing, it is generally more feasible for large projects
($2 million and above). These deals can be arranged by commercial and investment bankers as well as
individuals and firms that specialize in the field. To assess the feasibility of this tool for your project, contact
your attorney.

Private and Community Foundation PRIs: Obviously, we’d all like to fund every project with grant
capital, but that’s not always possible. Some private and community foundations have created Program-
Related-Investments, or PRIs, which are low-interest loans. Ask your current funders if this is something
they offer and if your planned project would be eligible.

United States Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development: For communities with populations under
20,000, Rural Development’s Community Facilities Program makes grants and loans to nonprofits at very
favorable terms (up to 40 years w/ fixed interest rates in the 5% range). For more on this, visit USDA’s
website at http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/. Unfortunately, the demand for these grants and loans exceeds the
supply and the supply line is shrinking. This source of funding works best when you have a generous time
line as it can take a while to secure such a loan. To assess your chances, contact the USDA office in your
county or call (919) 873-2070 to get the local number.

Community Development Block Grant and other government programs: These funds from the US
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are available as grants and loans for a wide range of
community projects. Projects must benefit low- and moderate-income families; prevent or eliminate slums

1
  In 1977, the federal government passed legislation encouraging banks to reinvest monies (i.e., make loans) in all the
communities from which they draw deposits (i.e., encourage lending to low-income and minority communities). The
legislation is called the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and, in response to it, many banks have set up special CRA
departments.
                                                                                                                          15

or blight; or meet other urgent community development needs. Funds are available through either your local
planning department (if you operate in a large city or an urban county), or through the state Division of
Community Assistance -- (919) 733-2850 -- if you operate in a small town or rural area. You might also ask
about Section 108 financing options. Financing is generally available several times a year through a
competitive application process. HOME funds and discretionary monies are also available to nonprofits, and
can be used for both community development activities and human service delivery programs. Contact your
city government to find out about other funds available locally. For more information, see HUD’s web page:
http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/about/cpd_programs.cfm.

Self-Help: We aim to fill the gaps. We lend throughout the state for almost any purpose (equipment,
working capital, real estate acquisition and renovations). Our loans range from $1,000 to several million
dollars with terms from several months to 20 years (for some housing-related loans we are able to offer terms
as long as 30 years). With some exceptions, our interest rates are competitive with market rates; currently
we have lower rates for child care and some supportive housing loans. While our rates may not be the
lowest, we generally offer greater flexibility in how the loan is structured, longer terms (this can translate
into lower payments on a monthly basis), and technical assistance to help you achieve your goals. Visit
http://www.self-help.org/commerciallending for more information.

                                       Structuring Your Loan Request

Getting approved for a loan will be easiest if your organization has a strong financial track record (operating
reserve in excess of 3-4 months), can document stable income moving forward, pays its bills on time, has
strong and stable leadership (staff and board), and an adequate down payment (25-30% if for a commercial
real estate project that is in a stable neighborhood and is not special use). If this is the case, your challenge
now is to find the best deal.

If, however, you do not have everything listed above, Self-Help has developed some options that may help
you improve your chances of getting a loan. In working through these options, the first step Self-Help takes
is to assess the viability of the organization and the proposed project. We will only look to the following
tools if we are convinced that the project will work for you. They are back-up measures.

Share-Secured Deposits: Either your organization and/or any of its stakeholders (board members, funders,
staff) can place deposits in Self-Help Credit Union and pledge them to your loan. The monies are at risk in
that we can tap them if the loan does not get paid back. However, while they are backing up the loan, they
are earning market rates of interest for their depositors in a federally-insured financial institution. Generally,
once the loan shows several years of strong repayment, we will release some or all of the securing deposits.
If the loan is fully share-secured (i.e., the deposit equals the loan amount), then the interest rate on the loan
will be as little as 2%, depending on the size of the loan and the desired interest rate on the deposits.

          Self-Help made a $14,000 loan to a human services agency that had undergone a change in
          executive directors. The new director called when she discovered that the agency was $9,000
          behind on its payroll taxes. Thanks to a community foundation and board members who
          placed deposits with Self-Help as share-security for the loan, we were able to deliver the
          needed cash quickly to pay off the IRS and give the agency an extra $5,000 to jump-start their
          fundraising efforts.

Guarantors: Lenders are sometimes less comfortable lending to nonprofits because, as a nonprofit
corporation, no one is personally on the line for its activities. Small business loans almost always require an
individual guarantor and often place a lien on all of that individual’s property. A strong nonprofit may not
need a guarantor (who can guarantee part or all of a loan), but it will always help strengthen a loan
application. To determine the quality of the guarantee, we’ll want to review the guarantor’s personal
financial position by asking him/her to complete a Personal Financial Statement (or providing us with the
same information in another form) and by contacting a credit bureau about her/his credit history.

          Self-Help made a $60,000 loan to a start-up nonprofit museum. The museum had raised most of
                                                                                                     16
Revised 7.10
          their budget through fundraisers, in-kind donations and grants, but had a gap. They needed
          $60,000 to complete the renovations and cover their operating costs until other grants and
          entrance fees would allow them to break even. We were able to make the loan by securing it
          with the museum’s equipment, a $10,000 share-secured deposit (see above) from one of it
          stakeholders, and a partial guarantee for $30,000 from another.

Additional Collateral: Another way to strengthen a loan is to offer additional collateral (usually real estate
and marketable securities, but we are open to discussing other assets). The nonprofit can do this by offering
other properties. So, too, can the other stakeholders. Commonly, board members or the founder of a start-up
nonprofit will pledge personal collateral, in addition to or in lieu of personally guaranteeing the loan. If an
individual is putting up collateral, but not guaranteeing the loan, we do not need to review his or her financial
position; we simply need to assess the value of the collateral.

          A $200,000 start-up loan to a charter school to purchase modular classrooms was made
          possible when one of its founders filled the gap between the collateral value of the trailers
          and the loan amount by putting up some of her stocks.

Seller Financing: If you are buying an existing building and lack an adequate down payment, the seller of
the building may be willing to make a loan for part of the purchase price. If the seller is willing to take a
subordinate lien position (i.e., be “second” behind us in the event of foreclosure or “seller second”) and you
can show that you can make the combined loan payments, then we can count the seller’s loan as a down
payment, thus enhancing your equity position.

          A small child care center wanted to expand by buying an existing child care that was on the
          market for $150,000. Because the buyer was putting all of its retained earnings into teacher
          pay, it could only afford a $10,000 down payment. To make the deal work, the seller agreed
          to provide a seller second for $20,000. At the closing, the seller received $120,000 cash from
          the Self-Help loan and $10,000 from the buyer and then signed a promissory note with
          $20,000 for the balance.

United States Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development Community Facilities
Guarantee Program: For communities with populations under 20,000, Rural Development’s
Community Facilities Program guarantees loans to nonprofit and governmental entities. The
guarantee is available for facilities, equipment and working capital. It can take some time to secure
the guarantee, but it can make or break a deal by covering as much as 80-90% of the loan.

          We were able to help a charter school that, in its rush to get started, had used some of its
          operating funds to pay for start-up capital expenditures. This caused a cash flow squeeze
          mid-year. The school had very limited collateral, yet needed $150,000 and some help with
          their budgeting to make it through the year. The USDA Guarantee and Self-Help’s technical
          assistance made the loan possible, and the school, which serves many low-income students, is
          now thriving.

Often we use a combination of these tools in structuring a loan. We encourage you to call us to explore
your organization’s financing needs. Please call the Self-Help office nearest you for more information.
If we think your best bet is a resource other than Self-Help, we’ll refer you appropriately. Otherwise,
we’ll work to develop a financing package specific to your needs.

     CAN GOING “GREEN” PUT MORE GREEN IN YOUR POCKET?
                       A WORD FROM OUR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE


Change Once, Save Every Month
Businesses and nonprofits often throw away hard-earned money through inefficient lighting, poor
insulation, water and material waste, and poorly maintained air conditioners/heaters. Instead of profits
for you, this money goes to utility companies, waste haulers and material suppliers.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Some solutions are free and simple. Others require an upfront investment
that pays back over time. By choosing to address these money-wasters today, you may realize
significant cost savings that will extend far into the future.

                              Common Ways Businesses Can Save
                     Heating/AC: Cleaning filters and heat-transfer coils can reduce energy
                     expenses. Window shades or awnings and strategically-planted trees can
                     produce big savings on air conditioning. Programmable thermostats are
                     another important energy saver. Caulking windows and doors, installing
                     storm windows and doors, and adding insulation may save on heating costs.

                     Lighting: Traditional bulbs and ballasts can be replaced with energy efficient
                     ones. Daylighting, room occupancy sensors, and task lighting can get quality
                     light where it is needed and reduce over-lighting.

                     Water: Quickly repairing leaky plumbing and putting faucet aerators on sinks
                     can reduce your water bill. EnergyStar water heaters save energy. Large
                     water users may want to consider preheating water with solar hot water
                     heaters. Drought-tolerant landscaping is another idea.
                     Office Settings: Consider EnergyStar computers and copiers; double-sided
                     printing; washable kitchenware rather than Styrofoam/plastic; refillable toner
                     cartridges; and paper and aluminum can recycling. Plants and non-toxic
                     cleaners help to keep the air clean and workers productive.

Examples of N.C. Businesses that Save $$$’s with “Green” Methods
                   Examples of N.C. Businesses that Save $$$’s with “Green” Method
     •    The Bridge Street Café in Hot Springs lowers its electric bill by using energy efficient lighting
          and daylighting, and insulating its building well. The historic restaurant uses cloth napkins
          instead of paper and a soda fountain instead of aluminum cans. It recycles and composts.

     •    Burlington apparel manufacturer T.S. Designs has made many “green” changes. Most notable is
          the conversion to organic cotton and non-toxic dyes. Workers benefit from upgraded task
          lighting. The company mows and waters less after replacing their lawn with low-maintenance
          and attractive native plants. See www.tsdesigns.com.

     •    The Iredell-Statesville School District designed a new elementary school to use energy more
          efficiently. High-performance thermal windows, occupancy sensors that turn off lights
          automatically, and the use of natural light have cut the building’s utilities by 33%.
