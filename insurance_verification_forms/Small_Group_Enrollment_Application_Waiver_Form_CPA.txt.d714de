I hereby acknowledge that I have been given the opportunity to participate in the group insurance plan provided by my employer and that I have declined

be required to wait until my group’s renewal or until a special enrollment (described below) occurs before coverage will be offered.

Special Enrollment Rights:
If you are declining enrollment for yourself or your dependents (including your spouse) because of other health insurance or group health plan coverage, you may in the future be able to enroll yourself
and your dependents in this plan, provided that you request enrollment within 31 days after you and your dependent’s other coverage ends, or not later than 60 days if the other plan coverage was
through Medicaid or a state Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In addition, if you have a new eligible dependent as a result of marriage, birth, adoption or placement for adoption, you may be
able to enroll yourself and your eligible dependents, provided that you request enrollment within 30 days after the marriage, birth, adoption or placement for adoption. To request special enrollment
or obtain more information, contact your employer or call the toll-free Highmark Member Service number: 1-800-345-3806 (TTY/TDD: Dial 711).

To the best of my knowledge and belief, the information provided on this application is true and correct.

 Any person who knowingly and with intent to defraud any insurance company or other person files an application for insurance or statement of claim
 containing any materially false information or conceals for the purpose of misleading, information concerning any fact material thereto commits a
 fraudulent insurance act, which is a crime and subjects such person to criminal and civil penalties.

I acknowledge and agree that any personally identifiable health information about me or my enrolled dependents (“Protected Health Information”) is
protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and other privacy laws, and that, in accordance with those laws,
