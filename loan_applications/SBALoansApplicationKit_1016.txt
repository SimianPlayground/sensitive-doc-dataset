IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING ACCOUNTS AT KEY
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires us to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each customer who opens an
account whether you are a new or existing customer. When you open an account with any entity within the KeyCorp family of companies, we require the following information for both the business
and the individual associated with the business: name, address, identification number, and in the case of an individual, his or her date of birth. We may also request to see approved identifying
documents. In all cases, Key is committed to protecting the privacy and identity of each of its customers.

The following is a brief summary of the laws applicable to this solicitation of information.

Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35)

SBA is collecting the information on this form to make a character and credit eligibility decision to fund or deny you
a loan or other form of assistance. The information is required in order for SBA to have sufficient information to
determine whether to provide you with the requested assistance. The information collected may be checked
against criminal history indices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a)

Any person can request to see or get copies of any personal information that SBA has in his or her file, when that
file is retrieved by individual identifiers, such as name or social security numbers. Requests for information about
another party may be denied unless SBA has the written permission of the individual to release the information to
the requestor or unless the information is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

Under the provisions of the Privacy Act, you are not required to provide your social security number. Failure to
provide your social security number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to which you are entitled.
Disclosures of name and other personal identifiers are, however, required for a benefit, as SBA requires an
individual seeking assistance from SBA to provide it with sufficient information for it to make a character
determination. In determining whether an individual is of good character, SBA considers the person's integrity,
candor, and disposition toward criminal actions. In making loans pursuant to section 7(a)(6) the Small Business
15 USC § 636 (a)(6), SBA is required to have reasonable assurance that the loan is of sound value Act (the Act),
and will be repaid or that it is in the best interest of the Government to grant the assistance requested.
Additionally, SBA is specifically authorized to verify your criminal history, or lack thereof, pursuant to section
7(a)(1)(B), 15 USC § 636(a)(1)(B). Further, for all forms of assistance, SBA is authorized to make all
investigations necessary to ensure that a person has not engaged in acts that violate or will violate the Act or the
Small Business Investment Act,15 USC §§ 634(b)(11) and 687b(a). For these purposes, you are asked to
voluntarily provide your social security number to assist SBA in making a character determination and to
distinguish you from other individuals with the same or similar name or other personal identifier.

When the information collected on this form indicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil,
criminal, or administrative in nature, SBA may refer it to the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local, or
foreign, charged with responsibility for or otherwise involved in investigation, prosecution, enforcement or
prevention of such violations. See 74 Fed. Reg. 14890 (2009) for other published routine uses.
