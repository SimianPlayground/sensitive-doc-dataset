                            SECTION I. GENERAL OVERVIEW
 Overview

The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Statewide Advanced Traffic Management
System (ATMS) is located in Columbus at the ODOT Central Office and is one of the primary tools
of the Traffic Management Center (TMC). The Statewide ATMS helps to manage traffic on Ohio's
interstates, freeways, expressways, and state highways in each of the State’s major metropolitan
areas including Akron/Canton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton/Springfield, and Toledo.
ATMS operators can control cameras and post traveler information messages to ODOT’s
Dynamic Message Signs (DMS), Highway Advisory Radio (HAR), and to the OHGO website, which
serves as separate but closely related Traveler Information System (TIS). TMC operators can also
act as liaisons between Freeway Service Patrol (FSP) vehicles, ODOT, and various other public
agencies that respond to the scenes of vehicle incidents. It also communicates with RWIS
Roadside Equipment throughout the state.

ODOT is seeking services to develop and integrate a next generation (NextGen) ATMS based on
previous systems engineering that includes a Feasibility Study, Concept of Operations and
Requirements Development. The goal is to replace ODOT’s current ATMS as well as other
ancillary solutions/processes as appropriate. The long-term vision is to integrate one solution
that can handle multiple transportation functions to include:
      •   Communicating with and controlling ODOT’s robust network of ITS devices
      •   Commanding and controlling variable speed limit and Hard Shoulder Running (HSR) corridors
          based on condition-based system-generated recommendations that can be accepted or
          modified by the operator
      •   Generating feeds of road closures and ongoing road activities that can tie into OHGO
      •   Integrating weather data (RWIS and/or otherwise)
      •   Displaying high resolution speed data
      •   Tracking active and planned road closures (e.g., work zones, traffic incidents, special events)
      •   Managing pre-determined detour routes (i.e., ODOT’s Playbook)
      •   Sending notifications of real-time traffic issues
      •   Integration with ODOT’s Asset and Archiving data, generating reports and performance
          measures
      •   Calculating travel times based on speed data feeds
      •   Decision support system for traffic management and Advanced Transportation and Demand
          Management (ATDM) initiatives
      •   Supporting ODOT’s Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) practices,
          policies and procedures
      •   Flexibility to grow and meet future needs (e.g., Lane closure permitting, CAD data integrations,
          Connected and Automated Vehicles)
      •   Reporting road conditions from a maintenance perspective
      •   Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data
      •   Integrated Data Warehouse
      •   Ability to consume multiple integrated data exchange (IDE) sources


                                                                                                      4
This RFP seeks proposals to allow ODOT to engage a single Vendor or Vendor team to deliver a
new ATMS that meets existing and future needs of ODOT on behalf of motorists who use the
state highway system. The ATMS is a set of information and data gathering systems, data analysis
and decision-making systems, and integrated device and personnel engagement tools that exist
to improve efficiency and accuracy in detection of traffic changes, understanding their scope and
engaging appropriate devices and communications systems to alert on-road travelers, partner
emergency responders, and those considering travel.

ODOT desires a strong and flexible working relationship with the chosen Vendor, and the levels
of cooperation and coordination that the successful Vendor can demonstrate will be a
consideration. It is important that the relationship begin with mutual respect and honesty, and
the Vendor continues to be reliable to handle the changes that will inevitably be part of the
process of development, integration, operations, and maintenance.

 Objectives

The Vendor’s obligation is to ensure the work they perform meets the objectives below for
delivery of an ATMS, and its operations and maintenance. The successful Vendor will work to
meet several State objectives:

      •   An ATMS solution that clearly demonstrates the capability and resources required to address
          current operational challenges and dramatically improve the precision and efficiency of Traffic
          Management activity throughout the state, targeting implementation in 9-12 months.
      •   The ATMS solution must facilitate through automation in the form of recommendations to the
          TMC operator, and personal interaction management of all aspects of TMC activity. Activity
          includes integration of tools, systems, and capabilities that facilitates early detection of traffic
          disruptions, analysis and understanding of impacts and extent, and engagement of people and
          systems to provide traveler information and clearance of traffic obstructions. This must be
          done in accordance with ODOT policies and procedures, local, State and Federal laws, and all
          Technical and Business Requirements.
      •   In order to meet ODOT’s needs, the ATMS solution must be highly scalable, fully configurable
          and be implemented using current proven standard technologies and best practices. ODOT will
          consider only those solutions which satisfy all requirements, both procedural and technical.
      •   The project described in this Request for Proposal may involve project work done at offsite
          locations. Any project work involving implementation and support activities required to be
          completed at ODOT must take place at the ODOT Central Office address shown below:

Project Plan. ODOT encourages responses that demonstrate a thorough understanding of the nature of
the work and what the Vendor must do to get the work done properly, including the approach the
Vendor will take to successfully achieve the Service Levels as well as the desired approach to annual
maintenance, upgrades, or new feature and customization builds/deployments. To this end, the Vendor
must submit a Project Plan that the Vendor will use to create a consistent and coherent management
plan for the work, as part of this Request for Proposal. The plan must include detail enough to give
ODOT an understanding of how the Vendor’s knowledge and approach will:

       •   Manage the work;
       •   Guide work execution;
       •   Document planning assumptions and decisions;
       •   Facilitate communication among stakeholders;
       •   Define key management review for content, scope, and schedule; and
       •   Provide a baseline for progress measurement and Work control.

 Assumptions. The Vendor must list all assumptions the Vendor made in preparing the Proposal. If any
 assumption is unacceptable to ODOT, ODOT may reject the Proposal. No assumptions may be included
 regarding negotiation, terms and conditions, or requirements.

 Support Requirements. The Vendor must describe the support it wants from ODOT other than what
 ODOT has offered in this RFP. Specifically, the Vendor must address:
       • Nature and extent of ODOT support required in terms of staff roles, percentage of time
           available;
       • Assistance from ODOT staff and the experience and qualification levels required; and
       • Other support requirements, such as access to certain systems, etc.
 ODOT may not be able or willing to provide the additional support the Vendor lists in this part of its
 Proposal. The Vendor therefore must indicate, in the form of a table, whether its request for additional
 support is a requirement for its performance. If any part of the list is a requirement, ODOT may reject
 the Vendor's Proposal if ODOT is unwilling or unable to provide the requested support.

The Vendor will need to confirm the proposed solution meets each of the individual
requirements for each part of the Requirements Matrix that is Attachment G of this RFP.

For each item, the proposer must indicate if the approach
• Meets Requirement (via Configuration) with no additional development
• Meets Requirement with additional development included in bid
       o Provide approach (2-3 sentences max) for items to be developed / customized
• Meets Requirement with Alternative Approach
       o Provide approach (2-3 sentences max) of alternate approach to meet requirement
• Does Not Meet Requirement
       o Provide (2-3 sentences max) for why requirement will not be provided in your solution

column), and they will be scored individually. The comment and/or illustration must be clear,
concise, and sufficient to allow reviewers to understand the approach, solution, and/or
demonstrated success in the proposer’s past experience.

 Scoring Assumptions and Technical Proposal

Proposals will be collectively scored by a Proposal Review Team (PRT) appointed by ODOT. For
each of the evaluation criteria given, reviewers will collectively judge whether the proposal does
not meet, partially meets, meets or exceeds each criterion, and assign the appropriate point
value. The scoring is by consensus and one official score sheet will be completed for each
technical proposal that is scored.

 PHASE I: Initial Qualifying Criteria

The proposal must meet the following Phase I proposal acceptance criteria in order to be
considered for further evaluation. Any proposal receiving a “no” response to any of the
following qualifying criteria shall be disqualified from consideration, and not evaluated.

 PHASE II: Criteria for Scoring of Technical Proposal

Qualifying technical proposals will be collectively scored by the PRT. For each of the evaluation
criteria given in the following scoring tables, reviewers will collectively judge whether the
proposal exceeds, meets, or does not meet the requirements expressed in the RFP, and assign
the appropriate point value, in a range, generally, as follows:

Technical Performance Scoring Definitions:
• “Does Not Meet Requirement”- A particular RFP requirement was not addressed in the
   vendor’s proposal, Score: 0
• “Partially Meets Requirement”-Vendor proposal demonstrates some attempt at meeting a
   particular RFP requirement, but that attempt falls below acceptable level, Score: 3
• “Meets Requirement”-Vendor proposal fulfills a particular RFP requirement in all material
   respects, potentially with only minor, non-substantial deviation, Score: 6
• “Exceeds Requirement”-Vendor proposal fulfills a particular RFP requirement in all material
   respects, and offers some additional level of quality in excess of ODOT expectations, Score: 10

Cost Per Quality Point
Vendors Total Submitted Cost: ________________ / Grand Total Technical Score: ______________




ODOT is not required to shortlist firms but may select directly from the answers on
qualifications and experience, project approach, technical requirements, and cost up to
five firms to participate in a demonstration/interview outlined below.

 PHASE III: Final Scoring of Technical Proposal

Process of Demonstration/Interview
Shortlist/Sandbox Demonstration: If firms are chosen to be placed on a shortlist for
consideration, those chosen may be required to provide access to a web-based “sandbox”
demonstration site within three (3) calendar days of notice and will be required to maintain that
site for up to 30 days. The site must be accessible to ODOT staff to allow the PRT to understand
                                                                                               32
the strengths, capabilities, and user experience of the firms. Failure to furnish an accessible
demonstration system will result in rejection of the response. The products should be
representative of the short-listed responder's solution. It is not anticipated or expected that
responders will perform significant programming for this demonstration. However, specific
information about functions and features that will be added or changed for this project should
be provided to ODOT at the time the sandbox demonstration is accessible to ODOT, to allow
ODOT an accurate evaluation. The responder must maintain the site and make any fixes to the
site preventing a proper evaluation as reported by ODOT in a timely manner.

Interview: If interviews are conducted, details of the interview will be provided at a later date. A
brief Vendor presentation will be permitted as part of the interview.

Scoring definitions for the demonstration phase are as follows:
• “Partially Meets Requirement”- Vendor demonstrates some attempt at meeting all the
   “Critical” RFP requirements associated with that category, but that attempt falls below
   acceptable level, Score: 3
• “Meets Requirement”- Vendor demo fulfills all the “Critical” requirements associated with
   that category in all material respects, potentially with only minor, non-substantial deviation,
   Score: 6
• “Exceeds Requirement”- Vendor demo fulfills all the “Critical” requirements associated with
   that category in all material respects, and offers some additional level of quality in excess of
   ODOT expectations, Score: 10


The total points earned from the demonstrations will then be added to each of the to the top
Vendors ’other scores to give each Vendor a grand total score.


Process for Considering the Cost Proposal

ODOT may, at its sole discretion, negotiate with any or all technically-qualifying Vendors for a
revised cost proposal. Vendors may then: 1) submit one last and best offer; 2) request that
ODOT view its original cost proposal as its last and best offer; or 3) may formally withdraw from
further consideration. The Vendor shall formally indicate its choice according to directions
provided by ODOT at that time. Upon receipt of all last and best offers, ODOT will then consider
those Vendors’ revised cost proposals.

A technical proposal’s score will be the sum of the point value for all the evaluation criteria. The
PRT will collectively score each individual qualifying proposal. Final proposal scoring will be
determined Cost per quality point method (Cost/Technical Proposal Score).




                                                                                                   33
                       SECTION V SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

ODOT has a set expectation for the performance and service level provided by the Vendor. This
section defines the required service level for the ATMS as well as base draft requirements to be
finalized during negotiations. Offerors’ proposal for Service Level Agreement will be
competitively scored to determine Award. If the level of service proposed by the offeror during
negotiations fails to meet the minimum required level of service, ODOT may be caused to cancel
award and enter into negotiations with the next highest scoring offeror.

ODOT Required Service Levels:
   •   The Vendor is expected to provide ongoing support for resolution of system issues. Support:
          o Provide production technical support via phone, email, messaging, or Vendor-supplied
             ticket system for appropriate ODOT staff to use regarding user or solution questions.
             Production technical support must be provided 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
                  Calls must be answered by a live English-speaking person.
          o Errors or issues may be defined as critical, major, or minor, or as a scheme proposed by the
             Vendor and agreed to by ODOT.
                  Initial contacts of a critical nature (e.g., system down, critical functionality not
                     working correctly, etc.) must be responded to within 15 minutes, with a resolution
                     or plan for resolution provided within one hour.
                         • Example critical system failures include general system failure, the inability to
                             post dynamic message sign (DMS) messages, the system not meeting
                             performance requirements for speed, or an outbound data feed is stopped.
                  Initial contacts for non-critical but major issues must be acknowledged within 30
                     minutes, with a resolution or plan for resolution provided within 48 hours.
                         • Example major system failures include the inability to post multiple
                             messages to DMS at once, publicly visible misinformation or misspellings, a
                             software service that fails and requires a restart, or reduced quality video
                             from a video server.
                  Acknowledgement of minor support and technical issues must be provided within
                     48 hours. Resolution should occur with next software build or within 14 days.
                         • Example minor system issues include such things as cosmetic defects in
                             operator or traveler information interfaces, assistance resolving minor
                             support or administrative issues, retrieving desired data, formatting and
                             saving queries and reports, GPS AVL query results, alternative ways to group,
                             present, or otherwise enhance the understanding of reports, etc.
                  All system issue contacts or related requests must be logged by the Vendor, and the
                     Vendor must provide a response or resolution to all contacts within 48 hours of
                     being logged or as otherwise agreed to by ODOT.
          o The Vendor’s issue reporting system may interface with ODOT’s existing ticketing platform
          o Vendor should generate emails to notify ODOT/third-party data Vendors that data issues
             are occurring


                                                                                                        32
          o   Notification within a configurable time period (default 15 minutes) of a device or public-
              facing interface experiencing issues

   •   System Updates and Maintenance:
           o Updates/rollouts should happen during overnight hours.
                  All updates and rollouts must be approved by ODOT prior to execution.
           o A continuity of operations backup / redundant environment must be supplied for in-place
             upgrades without system usages disruptions.
           o One 2- to 4-hour window will be supplied each month by ODOT to take system offline (if
             needed) for major upgrades or performance enhancements.
           o Integration and activation of a new device within the ATMS must be accomplished within 8
             hours.

   •   System Uptime and Performance:
           o System usage and expected uptime is 24x7 with exception to support and maintenance
             above.
           o Performance degradation due to slow internet or other factors to be reported and treated
             as any other issue in the Support section above.
           o System is expected to be elastic in nature to support uptick in usage for seasonal events
             (winter storms) or special events so performance remains the same in heavy use times.
           o Baseline load testing and heavy use simulations to be conducted quarterly to ensure
             proper performance with updates and releases.


NOTE: The below SLA requirements are to be considered draft requirements and the final terms
of the SLA shall be negotiated by and between ODOT and the awarded Vendor based on the
product being offered and the mechanism that are being used to provide it, such as a hosted or
non-hosted environment.

ODOT may evaluate the demonstrated ability of the Vendor to support the SLA requirements in
its determination of a preferred Vendor, prior to negotiations, and reserves the right to withdraw
the award based on any unsuccessful negotiation of the levels of service.

This section sets forth the performance specifications for the Service Level Agreements (SLA) to
be established between the Vendor and the State that are applicable to the Solution and
Managed Services elements. It contains the tables and descriptions that provide the State’s
framework, requirements relating to service level commitments, and the implications of meeting
versus failing to meet the requirements and objectives, as applicable. The mechanism set out
herein will be implemented to manage the Vendor’s performance against each Service Level, to
monitor the overall performance of the Vendor in delivery of the Service.

The Vendor will be required to comply with the following performance management and
reporting mechanisms for all Services within the scope of this RFP and must provide these reports
to the State as requested or agreed.
                                                                                                           33
Service Level Specific Performance – Agreed upon specific Service Levels to measure the
performance of specific Services or Service Elements. Most individual Service Levels are linked to
incent Vendor performance and liquidated damages.

Service Level Performance

Each Service Level (SL) will be measured using a “Green-Yellow-Red” traffic light mechanism (the
“Individual SL GYR State”), with “Green” representing the highest level of performance and “Red”
representing the lowest level of performance.

On a quarterly basis, there will be a “true-up” at which time the total amount of the Liquidate
Damages (LDs), if any, will be calculated. Said LDs will be set off against any fees owed by the
State to the Vendor. In the event of consecutive failures to meet the Service Levels, the State may
avail itself of additional remedies up to and including contract termination.

The Vendor will not be liable for any failed Service Level caused by circumstances beyond its
control, and that could not be avoided or mitigated through the exercise of prudence and
ordinary care, provided that the Vendor immediately notifies the State in writing and takes all
steps necessary to minimize the effect of such circumstances and resumes its performance of the
Services in accordance with the SLAs as soon as possible.

Failure to report any SLA, SLA performance in each month, and for any non-Green (i.e.,
performing to Standard) SLA a detailed root cause analysis that substantiates cause will
result in the State considering the performance of the Vendor for that period as
performing in a Red State.

Escalation for Repetitive Service Level Failures

The State may escalate repetitive service level failure to the Vendor’s executive sponsor, the
Vendor’s Managing Director / Lead Public Sector Partner for Public Sector, or the equivalent
position.

Service Level Requirements- Project Implementation and Managed Services
Vendor must meet the Service Level Commitment for each Service Level set forth in the table
below and specified in detail later in this section.

                              Project Implementation Service Level Agreement: Milestone Delivery Due Dates
Definition: Milestones means the milestone for the provision of deliverables specified in the Detailed Project Plan Vendor shall submit in Deliverable 1. The timely delivery of
services and achievement of milestones is essential to the Project objective. The Vendor must provide deliverables to the State in keeping with scheduled milestones that shall
be outlined in Vendor’s Detailed Project Plan under Deliverable 1. For the avoidance of doubt, the deliverables contained in this RFP as they pertain to the system Project and
general Ongoing Project Services delivery will represent the minimum set of expected deliverables.

Notwithstanding the State review and approval cycles, this SL will commence upon the delivery of its Detailed Project Plan in Deliverable 1 or current Detailed Project Plan as
mutually agreed upon.

Milestone Delivery Due Dates: The Milestones as outlined in Vendor’s Detailed Project Plan, Deliverable 1, are deliverable based and in the event the Milestones are not being
met the purpose of the Contract and usefulness to the users. Vendor shall use all reasonable endeavors to provide the relevant Deliverable to the State within 5 business days
of the relevant Milestone; Vendor shall at no additional cost to the State, allocate additional or re-allocate existing resources and personnel in order to provide the relevant
Deliverable within such five day period; State may without liability withhold payment in respect of any invoice issued in respect of Services relating to a Deliverable if such
deliverable is not provided within the period referred to in the Detailed Project Plan; and the State may terminate this Contract by written notice to Vendor if Vendor does not
provide the Deliverable for a Milestone within fourteen (14) days of such Milestone. In the event the Vendor does not meet a Milestone due to an act or omission of the State,
the Vendor shall use reasonable endeavors to provide the relevant Deliverable to the State within five days of the relevant Milestone and in any event will collaborate with the

        Project Implementation Service Level Agreement: UAT Severity 1 Outages Resolution – Mean Time to Repair
Prompt resolution of system issues identified as part of Vendor System/Unit Testing and/or User Acceptance Testing (UAT). This Service Level begins upon first migration
of Solution functionality into the User Acceptance environment. The State shall, in consultation with the Vendor, determine the Severity of each issue identified during
UAT. Formal declaration of the Severity of each UAT issue to the Vendor will be made by the State Project Manager.

Prioritization Severity 1: An Issue that prevents the State from authorizing Production migration of the associated functionality or module. Typical characteristics of
Severity 1 issues are situations that would prohibit the execution of productive work for a group(s) or individual performing a critical business function. Examples include,
but are not limited to: - ODH users are unable to securely interact with the system

Prioritization Severity 2: An issue that prevents the State from authorizing Production access to the associated functionality beyond customer support team members.
Typical characteristics of Severity 2 issues are situations that require restricted functionality access in a tightly controlled user environment to limit the risk of prohibited
execution of productive work for a group(s) or individual performing a critical business function. Examples include but are not limited to: Complicated workarounds are
required to use the functionality increasing the likelihood of user error and/or confusion; or ODH-specific configuration cannot be sufficiently completed to permit
deployment.

Prioritization Severity 3: An Issue that results in the State limiting ODH web customer use of or access to components/features of the associated functionality. Typical
characteristics of Severity 3 issues are situations that would have adverse effect on the rollout, adoption and training of the functionality. Examples include but are not
limited to ODH web customer use will result in significant number of support calls.

Measurement: Issue "Time to Repair" will be measured from the time the State reports the issue to the point in time the Vendor provides either a resolution or
workaround to the State for verification and acceptance. In the case where the resolution or workaround is determined by the State to be unacceptable the tracking of the
"Time to Repair" will recommence at the time the State reports the unacceptability. In the case of a workaround, the State may accept the workaround as a short-term
solution, allowing the resolution to move to Production, but still need the issue resolved at a lower Severity. In these circumstances the State will consider the associated
Severity 1 issue resolved and the Vendor will establish a new issue at the State determined Severity for management and tracking. The "Mean Time to Repair" for the
reporting month will be measured by assessing the elapsed time in business days (expressed as a decimal number to two positions after the decimal point that reflects the

                             Project Implementation Service Level Agreement: UAT Environment Availability
system UAT Environment is available to State users for scheduled UAT activities.

UAT Environment availability means access to the UAT functionality being tested is enabled; log-in is permitted from the local user LAN and test scripts can be executed.
The Vendor must implement State approved operational processes, instrumentation, monitoring and controls that validate availability of the system to State testers.

Measurement: This Service Level will be calculated for those Service Elements that are directly in the Vendor’s scope and will be measured from the end-user community
desktop to the ability to process transactions to the system database. If, in determination of the root cause of an “unavailable” condition, the State LAN, WAN and Data
Center outages, or the outage of State provided Infrastructure is the cause of the condition, the Vendor shall be excused from those outages that arise from such a
condition, unless the outage is a direct result of a Vendor created situation.

         Managed Services Service Levels: Issue Resolution – Mean Time to Repair
Prompt resolution of system Solution Severity 1 issues that impact State processing and processes. This Service Level
begins upon completion of agreed production acceptance criteria and a measurement period as documented in the
transition to production plan. The State shall, in consultation with the Vendor, determine the Severity of each issue. Formal
declaration of the Severity of each issue to the Vendor will be made by the State Project Manager.

Prioritization Severity 1: An Issue that is characterized by the following attributes. The Issue: renders a business critical
System, Service, Software, Equipment or network component unavailable, substantially unavailable or seriously impacts
normal business operations, in each case prohibiting the execution of productive work, or affects either a group or groups of
people, or a single individual performing a critical business function, or causes violation of policy, regulation or law thereby
placing the action at risk of audit and/or legal action.

Prioritization Severity 2: An Issue that is characterized by the following attributes. The Issue: does not render a business-
critical System, Service, Software, Equipment or network component unavailable, substantially unavailable but a function or
functions are not available, substantially unavailable or functioning as it/they should, and affects either a group or groups of
people, or a single individual performing a critical business function.

Prioritization Severity 3: An Issue shall be categorized as a “Severity 3 Issue” if the issue is characterized by the following
attributes. The Issue: causes a group of people or single individual to be unable to access or use a System, Service, Software,
Equipment or network component or a key feature thereof, and a reasonable workaround is not available, but
does not prohibit the execution of productive work.

Measurement: Issue "Time to Repair" will be measured from the time the State reports the issue to the point in time the
Vendor provides either a resolution or workaround to the State for verification and acceptance. In the case where the
resolution or workaround is determined by the State to be unacceptable the tracking of the "Time to Repair" will recommence
at the time the State reports the unacceptability. In the case of a workaround, the State may accept the workaround as a
short-term solution, allowing the resolution to move to Production, but still need the issue resolved at a lower Severity. In
these circumstances the State will consider the associated Severity 1 issue resolved and the Vendor will establish a new issue
at the State determined Severity for management and tracking.

Resolved Severity 1, 2 and 3 Production issues affecting the system do not reoccur or cause other issues as a result of the
resolution to the root cause of the Issue.

Monitoring compliance will be determined by tracking the following key performance indicator (KPI):
- Issue Recidivism tracking: the number of closed Severity 1 or 2 issues that reoccur and the number of new issues caused by
resolution of a Severity 1, 2 or 3 issue.

Measurement: Recidivism Rate will assess the number of recidivism occurrences in a month to the number of corresponding

        Managed Services Service Levels: Online Performance and Responsiveness
The system performs within expected norms; the end user experience is high performance and responsive.

This Service Level begins upon completion of agreed production acceptance criteria and a measurement period as
documented in the transition to production plan.

Definition: Solution Performance and Responsiveness will be based upon an end-to-end service class performance
baseline (e.g., application/session response time) performed by the Vendor during the transition or as mutually agreed.

Should the Vendor wish to accept State defined benchmarks in lieu the aforementioned baselining, these values shall serve
as the “Performance Baseline” for this Service Level.

Thereafter, the Vendor will perform automated testing on a daily basis for online transaction elements or provide objective
evidence from system generated statistics and compare these to the Performance Baseline.

Two percent deviation values from the Performance Baseline will be calculated for Online Performance and Responsiveness.

across the State’s LAN / WAN infrastructure. Normal traffic patterns at major sites should be
supported.

Today, the State’s WAN (OARnet) consists of more than 1,850 miles of fiber-optic backbone, with
more than 1,500 miles of it operating at ultrafast 100 Gbps speeds. The network blankets the state,
providing connectivity to all State Government Agencies.

The State of Ohio Network infrastructure utilizes private addressing, reverse proxy technology and
Network Address Translation (NAT). All applications that are to be deployed within the
infrastructure must be tolerant of these technologies for both internal product interaction as well
as external user access to the proposed system, infrastructure or application.

The State network team will review applications requirements involving excessive bandwidth (i.e.
voice, video, telemetry, or applications) deployed at remote sites.

 5.1.      Protection of State Data

      •   Protection of State Data. “State Data” includes all data and information created by, created for, or
          related to the activities of the State and any information from, to, or related to all persons that
          conduct business or personal activities with the State, including, but not limited to, PII and SSI. To
          protect State Data as described in this Contract, in addition to its other duties regarding State Data,
          Vendor will: Maintain in confidence any personally identifiable information (“PI”) and State Sensitive
          Information (“SSI”) it may obtain, maintain, process, or otherwise receive from or through the State
          in the course of the Contract;
      •   Use and permit its employees, officers, agents, and independent contractors to use any PII/SSI
          received from the State solely for those purposes expressly contemplated by the Contract;
      •   Not sell, rent, lease or disclose, or permit its employees, officers, agents, and independent contractors
          to sell, rent, lease, or disclose, any such PII/SSI to any third party, except as permitted under this
          Contract or required by applicable law, regulation, or court order;
      •   Take all commercially reasonable steps to (a) protect the confidentiality of PII/SSI received from the
          State and
      •   (b) establish and maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards to prevent unauthorized
          access by third parties to PII/SSI received by the Vendor from the State;


                                                                                                              53
   •    Give access to PII/SSI of the State only to those individual employees, officers, agents, and
        independent contractors who reasonably require access to such information in connection with the
        performance of Vendor’s obligations under this Contract;
   •    Upon request by the State, promptly destroy or return to the State in a format designated by the
        State all PII/SSI received from the State;
   •    Cooperate with any attempt by the State to monitor Vendor’s compliance with the foregoing
        obligations as reasonably requested by the State from time to time. The State shall be responsible
        for all costs incurred by Vendor for compliance with this provision of this subsection;
   •    Establish and maintain data security policies and procedures designed to ensure the following:
        • Security and confidentiality of PII/SSI;
        • Protection against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of PII/SSI; and
        • Protection against the unauthorized access to, disclosure of or use of PII/SSI.

 5.1.1. Disclosure

Disclosure to Third Parties. This Contract shall not be deemed to prohibit disclosures in the
following cases:
Required by applicable law, regulation, court order or subpoena; provided that, if the Vendor or
any of its representatives are ordered or requested to disclose any information provided by the
State, whether PII/SSI or otherwise, pursuant to court or administrative order, subpoena,
summons, or other legal process or otherwise believes that disclosure is required by any law,
ordinance, rule or regulation, Vendor will promptly notify the State in order that the State may
have the opportunity to seek a protective order or take other appropriate action. Vendor will also
cooperate in the State’s efforts to obtain a protective order or other reasonable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded the information provided by the State. If, in the absence
of a protective order, Vendor is compelled as a matter of law to disclose the information provided
by the State, Vendor may disclose to the party compelling disclosure only the part of such
information as is required by law to be disclosed (in which case, prior to such disclosure, Vendor
will advise and consult with the State and its counsel as to the scope of such disclosure and the
nature of wording of such disclosure) and Vendor will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain confidential treatment for the information;
   •    To State auditors or regulators;
   •    To service providers and agents of either party as permitted by law, provided that such service
        providers and agents are subject to binding confidentiality obligations; or
   •    To the professional advisors of either party, provided that such advisors are obligated to maintain
        the confidentiality of the information they receive.

 5.2.    Handling the State’s Data

The Vendor must use due diligence to ensure computer and telecommunications systems and
services involved in storing, using, or transmitting State Data are secure and to protect State Date
from unauthorized disclosure, modification, use or destruction. To accomplish this, the Vendor
must adhere to the following principles:
   •    Apply appropriate risk management techniques to balance the need for security measures against
        the sensitivity of the State Data.
   •    Ensure that its internal security policies, plans, and procedures address the basic security elements
        of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of State Data.


                                                                                                          54
   •    Maintain plans and policies that include methods to protect against security and integrity threats
        and vulnerabilities, as well as detect and respond to those threats and vulnerabilities.
   •    Maintain appropriate identification and authentication processes for information systems and
        services associated with State Data.
   •    Maintain appropriate access control and authorization policies, plans, and procedures to protect
        system assets and other information resources associated with State Data.
   •    Implement and manage security audit logging on information systems, including computers and
        network devices.

 5.3.    Vendor Access to State Networks Systems and Data

The Vendor must maintain a robust boundary security capacity that incorporates generally
recognized system hardening techniques. This includes determining which ports and services are
required to support access to systems that hold State Data, limiting access to only these points,
and disable all others.

To do this, the Vendor must:
   •    Use assets and techniques such as properly configured firewalls, a demilitarized zone for handling
        public traffic, host-to-host management, Internet protocol specification for source and destination,
        strong authentication, encryption, packet filtering, activity logging, and implementation of system
        security fixes and patches as they become available.
   •    Use two-factor authentication to limit access to systems that contain particularly sensitive State
        Data, such as personally identifiable information.
   •    Assume all State Data is both confidential and critical for State operations. The Vendor’s security
        policies, plans, and procedure for the handling, storage, backup, access, and, if appropriate,
        destruction of State Data
   •    must be commensurate to this level of sensitivity unless the State instructs the Vendor otherwise in
        writing.
   •    Employ appropriate intrusion and attack prevention and detection capabilities. Those capabilities
        must track unauthorized access and attempts to access State Data, as well as attacks on the
        Vendor’s infrastructure associated with the State Data. Further, the Vendor must monitor and
        appropriately address information from its system tools used to prevent and detect unauthorized
        access to and attacks on the infrastructure associated with the State Data.
   •    Use appropriate measures to ensure that State Data is secure before transferring control of any
        systems or media on which State Data is stored. The method of securing the State Data must be
        appropriate to the situation and may include secure overwriting, destruction, or encryption of the
        State Data before transfer of control. The transfer of any such system or media must be reasonably
        necessary for the performance of the Vendor’s obligations under this Contract.
   •    Have a business continuity plan in place that the Vendor tests and updates at least annually. The plan
        must address procedures for response to emergencies and other business interruptions. Part of the
        plan must address backing up and storing data at a location sufficiently remote from the facilities at
        which the Vendor maintains State Data in case of loss of State Data at the primary site. The Vendor’s
        backup solution must include plans to recover from an intentional deletion attempt by a remote
        attacker with compromised administrator credentials (e.g., keeping periodic copies offline, or in
        write-only format).

The plan also must address the rapid restoration, relocation, or replacement of resources
associated with the State Data in the case of a disaster or other business interruption. The
Vendor’s business continuity plan must address short- and long-term restoration, relocation, or
                                                                                                         55
replacement of resources that will ensure the smooth continuation of operations related to the
State’s Data. Such resources may include, among others, communications, supplies, transportation,
space, power and environmental controls, documentation, people, data, software, and hardware.
The Vendor also must provide for reviewing, testing, and adjusting the plan on an annual basis.
   •    Not allow the State Data to be loaded onto portable computing devices or portable storage
        components or media unless necessary to perform its obligations under this Contract. If necessary
        for such performance, the Vendor may permit State Data to be loaded onto portable computing
        devices or portable storage components or media only if adequate security measures are in place to
        ensure the integrity and security of the State Data. Those measures must include a policy on
        physical security for such devices to minimize the risks of theft and unauthorized access that
        includes a prohibition against viewing sensitive or confidential data in public or common areas. In
        addition, all state data on portable media shall be encrypted.
   •    Ensure that portable computing devices have anti-virus software, personal firewalls, and system
        password protection. In addition, the State Data must be encrypted when stored on any portable
        computing or storage device or media or when transmitted from them across any data network.
   •    Maintain an accurate inventory of all such devices and the individuals to whom they are assigned.

 5.4.    Portable Devices, Data Transfer and Media

Any encryption requirement identified in this Supplement means encryption that complies with
National Institute of Standards Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 as demonstrated
by a valid FIPS certificate number. Any sensitive State Data transmitted over a network or taken off
site via removable media must be encrypted pursuant to the State’s Data encryption standard ITS-
SEC-01 Data Encryption and Cryptography.

The Vendor must have reporting requirements for lost or stolen portable computing devices
authorized for use with State Data and must report any loss or theft of such devices to the State in
writing as quickly as reasonably possible. The Vendor also must maintain an incident response
capability for all security breaches involving State Data whether involving mobile devices or media
or not. The Vendor must detail this capability in a written policy that defines procedures for how
the Vendor will detect, evaluate, and respond to adverse events that may indicate a breach or
attempt to attack or access State Data or the infrastructure associated with State Data.

To the extent the State requires the Vendor to adhere to specific processes or procedures in
addition to those set forth above in order for the Vendor to comply with the managed services
principles enumerated herein, those processes or procedures are set forth in this contract.

 5.5.    Limited Use; Survival of Obligations

Vendor may use PII/SSI only as expressly authorized by the Contract and for no other purpose.
Vendor’s limited right to use PII/SSI expires upon conclusion, non-renewal or termination of this
Agreement for any reason. Vendor’s obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure survive
termination or expiration for any reason of this Agreement.

 5.6.    Disposal of PII/SSI

Upon expiration of Vendor’s limited right to use PII/SSI, Vendor must return all physical
embodiments to the State or, with the State’s permission; Vendor may destroy PII/SSI. Upon the
                                                                                                      56
State’s request, Vendor shall provide written certification to the State that Vendor has returned, or
destroyed, all such PII/SSI in Vendor’s possession.

 5.7.   Remedies

If Vendor or any of its representatives or agents breaches the covenants set forth in these provisions,
irreparable injury may result to the State or third parties entrusting PII/SSI to the State. Therefore,
the State’s remedies at law may be inadequate and the State shall be entitled to seek an injunction
to restrain any continuing breach. Notwithstanding any limitation on Vendor’s liability, the State
shall further be entitled to any other rights or remedies that it may have in law or in equity.

 5.8.   Prohibition on Off-Shore and Unapproved Access

The Vendor shall comply in all respects with U.S. statutes, regulations, and administrative
requirements regarding its relationships with non-U.S. governmental and quasi-governmental
entities including, but not limited to the export control regulations of the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and the Export Administration Act (“EAA”); the anti-boycott and
embargo regulations and guidelines issued under the EAA, and the regulations of the U.S.
Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, HIPAA Privacy Rules and other
conventions as described and required in this Supplement.

The Vendor will provide resources for the work described herein with natural persons who are lawful
permanent residents as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101 (a)(20) or who are protected individuals as defined
by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3). It also means any corporation, business association, partnership, society,
trust, or any other entity, organization or group that is incorporated to do business in the U.S. It
also includes any governmental (federal, state, local), entity.

The State specifically prohibits sending, taking or making available remotely (directly or indirectly)
any State information including State Data, software, code, intellectual property, designs and
specifications, system logs, system data, personal or identifying information and related materials
out of the United States in any manner, except by mere travel outside of the U.S. by a person
whose personal knowledge includes technical data; or transferring registration, control, or
ownership to a foreign person, whether in the U.S. or abroad, or disclosing (including oral or visual
disclosure) or transferring in the United States any State article to an embassy, any agency or
subdivision of a foreign government (e.g., diplomatic missions); or disclosing (including oral or
visual disclosure) or transferring data to a foreign person, whether in the U.S. or abroad.

The Vendor shall not use State data for any engagements outside of the scope of the contracted
agreement. Using State of Ohio data to test or provide proof-of-concept for other engagements is
expressly prohibited.
It is the responsibility of all individuals working at the State to understand and comply with the
policy set forth in this document as it pertains to end-use export controls regarding State
restricted information.

 Where the Vendor is handling confidential employee or citizen data associated with Human Resources
 data, the Vendor will comply with data handling privacy requirements associated with HIPAA and as
                                                                                                     57

     5.9.2. Criminal/Civil Sanctions

1.          Each officer or employee of any person to whom returns or return information is or may be
            disclosed will be notified in writing by such person that returns or return information disclosed to
            such officer or employee can be used only for a purpose and to the extent authorized herein, and
            that further disclosure of any such returns or return information for a purpose or to an extent
            unauthorized herein constitutes a felony punishable upon conviction by a fine of as much as $5,000
            or imprisonment for as long as 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. Such
            person shall also notify each such officer and employee that any such unauthorized further
            disclosure of returns or return information may also result in an award of civil damages against the
            officer or employee in an amount not less than $1,000 with respect to each instance of
            unauthorized disclosure. These penalties are prescribed by IRCs7213 and 7431 and set forth at 26
            CFR 301.6103(n)-1.
2.          Each officer or employee of any person to whom returns or return information is or may be
            disclosed shall be notified in writing by such person that any return or return information made
            available in any format shall be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this
            Contract. Information contained in such material shall be treated as confidential and shall not be
            divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the
            performance of the Contract. Inspection by or disclosure to anyone without an official need-to-
            know constitutes a criminal misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of as much as
            $1,000 or imprisonment for as long as 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. Such
            person shall also notify each such officer and employee that any such unauthorized inspection or
            disclosure of the officer or employee (United States for Federal employees) in an amount equal to
            the sum of the greater of $1,000 for each act of unauthorized inspection or disclosure with respect
            to which such defendant is found liable or the sum of the actual damages sustained by the plaintiff
                                                                                                              59
               as a result of such unauthorized inspection or disclosure plus in the case of a willful inspection or
               disclosure which is the result of gross negligence, punitive damages, plus the costs of the action.
               These penalties are prescribed by IRC 7213A and 7431.
3.             Additionally, it is incumbent upon the Vendor to inform its officers and employees of the penalties
               for improper disclosure imposed by the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. Specifically, 5 U.S.C.
               552a(i)(1), which is made applicable to contractors by 5 U.S.C. 552a(m)(1), provides that any officer
               or employee of a contractor, who by virtue of his/her employment or official position, has
               possession of or access to agency records which contain individually identifiable information, the
               disclosure of which is prohibited by the Privacy Act or regulations established thereunder, and who
               knowing that disclosure of the specific material is prohibited, willfully discloses the material in any
               manner to any person or agency not entitled to receive it, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
               fined not more than $5,000.


The IRS and the Agency shall have the right to send its officers and employees into the offices and
plants of the Vendor for inspection of the facilities and operations provided for the performance
of any work under this Contract. On the basis of such inspection, specific measures may be required
in cases where the contractor is found to be noncompliant with Contract safeguards.

     5.        Vendor Responsibilities Related to Reporting of Concerns, Issues and
               Security/Privacy Issues

     6.1.      General

If, over the course of the Contract a security or privacy issue arises, whether detected by the State,
a State auditor or the Vendor, that was not existing within an in-scope environment or service
prior to the commencement of any contracted service associated with this Contract, the Vendor
must:
          •   notify the State of the issue or acknowledge receipt of the issue within two (2) hours;
          •   within forty-eight (48) hours from the initial detection or communication of the issue from the State,
              present a potential exposure or issue assessment document to the State Account Representative and
              the State Chief Information Security Officer with a high-level assessment as to resolution actions and
              a plan;
          •   within four (4) calendar days, and upon direction from the State, implement to the extent
              commercially reasonable measures to minimize the State’s exposure to security or privacy until such
              time as the issue is resolved; and
          •   upon approval from the State implement a permanent repair to the identified issue at the Vendor’s
              cost.

     6.2.      Actual or Attempted Access or Disclosure

If the Vendor determines that there is any actual, attempted or suspected theft of, accidental
disclosure of, loss of, or inability to account for any PII/SSI by Vendor or any of its subcontractors
(collectively “Disclosure”) and/or any unauthorized intrusions into Vendor’s or any of its
subcontractor’s facilities or secure systems (collectively “Intrusion”), Vendor must immediately:
          •   Notify the State within two (2) hours of the Vendor becoming aware of the unauthorized Disclosure
              or Intrusion;
          •   Investigate and determine if an Intrusion and/or Disclosure has occurred;

       breach within twenty-four (24) hours of the Vendor becoming aware of the suspected breach.
  •    The Vendor must fully cooperate with the State to mitigate the consequences of such a
       breach/suspected breach. This includes any use or disclosure of the State Data that is inconsistent
       with the terms of this Contract and of which the Vendor becomes aware, including but not limited to,
       any discovery of a use or disclosure that is not consistent with this Contract by an employee, agent,
       or subcontractor of the Vendor.
  •    The Vendor must give the State full access to the details of the breach/suspected breach and assist
       the State in making any notifications to potentially affected people and organizations that the State
       deems are necessary or appropriate. The Vendor must document all such incidents/suspected
       incidents, including its response to them, and make that documentation available to the State on
       request.
  •    In addition to any other liability under this Contract related to the Vendor’s improper disclosure of
       State Data, and regardless of any limitation on liability of any kind in this Contract, the Vendor will be
       responsible for acquiring one year’s identity theft protection service on behalf of any individual or
       entity whose personally
  •    identifiable information is compromised while it is in the Vendor’s possession. Such identity theft
       protection must provide coverage from all three major credit reporting agencies and provide

                                                                                                            61

     http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/ContractAdmin/Contracts/Purchase/PBQ-Answers.doc
     It is each bidder’s sole responsibility to check the website for updates to pre-bid questions and answers
     before submitting its bid package to the Department.

5.   MODIFICATIONS TO THE BIDDING DOCUMENTS: When it is deemed necessary to modify these bidding
     documents, the Department will only do so by written addendum. The issuance of an addendum is
     dependent upon the information received and the impact on the competitive bid process. All issued
     addenda will be posted to the Department’s Upcoming ITB’s website and shall be automatically
     incorporated into the bidding/contract documents:

     http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/ContractAdmin/Contracts/Lists/PurchaseUpcomingITBs/UpI
     TBs.aspx
     In addition to posting on the above website, the Department also may email addenda information out to all
     known bidders for convenience purposes only. The Department shall not be held responsible for a bidder’s
     failure to receive the email with the addenda information. It is the sole responsibility of all interested bidders
     to diligently visit the above-listed website to see if any addenda have been issued prior to submitting their
     bid to the Department. Those interested in obtaining addenda information via email for a particular
     invitation to bid must send the Department its request in writing to the following email address:
     Contracts.Purchasing@dot.ohio.gov

6.   PRE-BID CONFERENCES: The Department reserves the right to hold mandatory or optional pre-bid
     conferences at its discretion. Conferences may be held either in-person or via webinar/phone conference
     formats. Bidders will be required to sign-in at all pre-bid conferences. The sign-in sheet for all pre-bid
     conferences is considered a public record, will be kept in the bid file, and will be shared with any requesting
     party. Additionally, any business cards collected during any pre-bid conference shall be considered public
     records and may be distributed out to all conference attendees. Any changes to the requirements or
     specifications of an invitation to bid, as a result of the pre-bid conference content, will be made by written
     addendum and publicly posted.

     For mandatory pre-bid conferences, the Department requires that those companies intending on submitting
     a bid be in attendance for the entire duration of the pre-bid conference. Mandatory pre-bid conferences will
     officially begin five (5) minutes after the scheduled date and start time at the location specified in the
     Special Terms and Conditions. Those bidders not in attendance at that time will be considered ineligible to
     submit a bid. The conference will be considered adjourned and complete when a representative of the
     Office of Contract Sales, Purchasing Services section indicates so. To be considered in attendance and
     eligible to bid, a bidder must have at least one representative of the company in attendance. A single
     representative cannot be present on behalf of two or more companies (bidders). Each company (bidder)
     must send its own representative on behalf of their organization. It is the sole responsibility of the bidder to
     ensure that the representative follows the sign-in procedures to properly document the bidder’s attendance.
     The Department shall not be held responsible for a bidder’s failure to arrive at the meeting on time, properly
     sign-in, or failure to stay for the entire duration of the meeting.

7.   WHERE BIDS MUST BE DELIVERED TO: The Department only accepts hand delivered and mailed bid
     packages. Bids submitted via email, telephone, electronic facsimile (fax), or any other mode of electronic
     transmission will not be considered a responsive bid submission. Bids must be in possession of the ODOT
     Office of Contract Sales, Purchasing Services section, on or prior to 2:00 p.m. eastern time, on the
     scheduled date of the bid submission deadline (public bid opening) as listed on the cover of this Invitation
     to Bid (ITB). Properly labeled bid packages must be either hand delivered by the bidder to the Office of
     Contract Sales, Purchasing Services section or mailed to the following EXACT address:




                                                                                                                   70
                                   Ohio Department of Transportation,
                         Office of Contract Sales, Purchasing Services, 1st floor
                                  1980 West Broad St. Mail Stop 4110
                                          Columbus, OH 43223
                                    (614) 644-7870 or (614) 752-9017
                                    Main Office Line: 1-800-459-3778
                OFFICE HOURS: 7:30-3:30, M-F (excluding State of Ohio recognized holidays)

      For hand delivery of bids, the Office of Contract Sales, Purchasing Services section is located on the 1st
      floor of ODOT Central Office (same address as where bids will be received). Bidders will be required to
      sign-in at the front desk of the building and then must be escorted back to the Office of Contract Sales,
      Purchasing Services section in order to drop off their bid. It is the responsibility of the bidder to ensure
      enough time is allotted to allow for all sign in and security procedures prior to the 2:00 p.m. bid submission
      deadline. Delivery of bids to any other location (including the ODOT mailroom), does not constitute receipt
      by the Purchasing Services section. Bids delivered to the ODOT mail room by a courier service must be
      delivered so as to leave a reasonable amount of time for the transfer of the bid to the Purchasing Services
      section. The ODOT mail room delivers received mail to Purchasing Services at scheduled times during
      normal office hours.

8.    LATE BIDS: A bid received after 2:00 p.m. eastern time, on the bid submission deadline (bid opening date)
      established, shall be deemed “Late” and will not be considered for award of this invitation to bid. The late
      bid package will be marked as late, remain sealed, and will be kept in the Department’s bid file to serve as
      official record of a late bid having been received.

      Note: The Office of Contract Sales, Purchasing Services timeclock takes precedence over any other
      timekeeping device (e.g. cell phones, other ODOT clocks, wrist watches, etc.) and will be utilized by the
      Department to determine whether or not a bid was received by the 2:00 p.m. deadline.

9.    PUBLIC BID OPENING PROCEDURE: All bids in possession of the Purchasing Services section shall be
      publicly opened, at ODOT Central Office, Office of Contract Sales, Purchasing Services section, 1st floor,
      starting at 2:01 p.m. on the scheduled date of public bid opening (bid submission deadline). All bids will be
      opened and read to any interested parties in attendance. At the conclusion of the public bid opening, bids
      may no longer be shared with interested parties until after a contract award has been made.

10.   BIDS FIRM: Once publicly opened, all bids are firm and cannot be altered by the bidder. Once a Contract is
      awarded and executed, the Vendor shall deliver all products and/or services at the bid prices and terms
      contained in the Contract. All submitted bids shall remain valid for a period of sixty (60) calendar days after
      the date of the public bid opening. Beyond sixty (60) calendar days, bidders will have the option to either
      honor their submitted bid or make a written request to withdraw their bid from consideration. The Ohio
      Department of Transportation shall receive the benefit of any decrease in price during the sixty (60) day
      period.

11.   WITHDRAWAL OF BIDS: A bidder may, by way of written notice to the Purchasing Services section,
      request to withdraw their bid response prior to the bid submission deadline. The request must be received
      by the Purchasing Services Section PRIOR to the start of the public bid opening (beginning at 2:01 p.m.)
      on the date of the bid submission deadline. Such written notice must set forth the specific reasons for the
      bid withdrawal.

      For requests to withdrawal a bid after the public bid opening has begun, the bidder may request to
      withdraw their bid response from consideration if the unit bid price(s) submitted are unreasonably lower
      than the other bids received, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the reason for the unit bid
      price(s) being substantially lower was due to an unintentional and substantial arithmetical error or
      unintentional omission of a substantial quantity of material or labor in the compilation of the bid. Written
      notice of any such request to withdraw after the bid opening must be received by the Purchasing Services
      section within no later than forty-eight (48) hours of the scheduled public bid opening.




                                                                                                                 71
      The decision to allow a bid to be withdrawn is at the sole discretion of the Purchasing Services section. If
      the bid is to be awarded by category, lot, or group the withdrawal request will apply to all items within the
      category, lot, or group. All documents and conversations relating to any withdrawal request will become a
      part of the permanent bid file.

12.   MODIFICATION OF SUBMITTED BIDS PRIOR TO PUBLIC BID OPENING: A bidder may request to
      modify their bid response prior to the scheduled date and time set for the public bid opening (i.e. bid
      submission deadline). To modify a bid response, the bidder must provide an alternate, complete bid
      package containing all required forms and necessary documents. The alternate bid package must be
      marked somewhere on the outer packaging as “REVISED”. Purchasing Services will not return the original
      bid package to the bidder. The original bid package will be kept in the contract file.

      In order to protect the integrity of the bidding process, bids shall not be prepared on the premises of ODOT.
      Any bid which is prepared on the premises of ODOT may be immediately disqualified and receive no
      further consideration for award.

13.   UNIT BID PRICES: The unit bid price(s) submitted shall govern the award of this invitation to bid unless
      otherwise specified in the bid evaluation criteria. The unit bid price should be entered for each required bid
      item on the Department’s pricing page. Use of ditto marks, arrows, or other markings in lieu of the actual
      unit price may result in a non-responsive bid determination. Lot or group prices listed in the unit bid price
      area shall be considered as the unit price unless clearly identified as the lot price. Unless specifically
      allowed in the contract’s terms and conditions, requests to change or alter unit bid prices after the public
      bid opening are prohibited.

      The following requirements also apply to unit bid prices:

            a. DECIMAL POINT: Bidders should not insert a unit cost of more than two (2) digits to the right of
            the decimal point. Digit(s) beyond two (2) will be dropped and not recognized by the Department for
            the purposes of bid evaluation or contract award.

            b. CREDIT CARD FEES: Bidders must incorporate into their unit bid price(s) submitted all costs and
            fees associated with the State’s use of a payment (credit) card.

            c. DISCOUNTS: While bidders may offer to the Department discounts for prompt payment and other
            similar incentives, discounts and incentives these will not be used to alter the submitted unit bid
            price(s) for purposes of bid evaluation and contract award. This section only applies to bids awarded
            to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder either by individual bid item or group of bid items and
            does not include bids which are awarded to all responsive and responsible bidders (i.e. Multiple
            Award Contracts).

            d. MULTIPLE AWARD CONTRACTS: Pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 5513.02, the Department
            may award Contracts to all responsive and responsible bidders for articles (i.e. bid items) meeting the
            general specifications provided. These are referenced by the Department as ‘Multiple Award
            Contracts’. Unit bid prices submitted for Multiple Award Contracts shall be considered by the
            Department as an amount-not-to-exceed unit bid price for the entire duration of the Contract. These
            awarded, amount-not-to-exceed bid prices often do not reflect potential quantity discounts, freight
            discounts, nor other similar discounts/incentives offered periodically by a distributor, manufacturer, or
            supplier. Where like or similar bid items are being offered by two or more awarded Vendors (bidders)
            on the awarded Contract, the Department reserves the right to obtain quotes from all awarded
            bidders on the Contract in order to achieve the best and most up-to-date pricing available to the
            Department at the time of ordering.

            e. UNBALANCED BIDS: The Department will not accept unit bid prices that are deemed to be either
            materially or mathematically unbalanced. The final determination of an unbalanced unit bid price shall
            be at the Department’s sole discretion.




                                                                                                                 72
             f. TIE BID PROCESS: If two or more responsive bids offer the same unit bid price, ODOT may break
             the tie as follows: during the bid evaluation process, the bidders that submitted tie bids will be
             contacted and given up to three (3) business days to submit a written revised unit price for the
             affected item or items. Bidders are not required to submit a revised unit price. In the event a tie still
             exists after the above-prescribed deadline has passed, ODOT will schedule a coin flip to be
             conducted in the presence of both bidders. The winner of the coin flip will be deemed awarded the
             affected bid item(s).

14.    PREFERENCE FOR OHIO/BORDER STATE PRODUCTS: The bid award for this invitation to bid may be
       subject to the domestic preference provisions of the Buy America Act, 41 U.S.C.A., 10a-10d, as amended,
       and to the preference for Ohio products under O.R.C. Sections 125.09 and 125.11 and Ohio
       Administrative Code Rule 123:5-1-06. A bidder must complete the enclosed Buy Ohio/Buy America
       Certification Statement form to be eligible to receive any applicable bid preferences.

15.    RESPONSIVE BIDDER: A bidder is responsive if its bid responds to the bid specifications in all material
       respects and contains no irregularities or deviations from the specifications that would affect the amount of
       the bid or otherwise give the bidder an unfair competitive advantage.

16.    MINOR INFORMALITIES OR IRREGULARITIES IN BIDS: A minor informality or irregularity is one that is
       merely a matter of form and not of substance. It also pertains to some immaterial defect in a bid or variation
       of a bid from the exact requirements of the invitation that can be corrected or waived without being
       prejudicial to other bidders. The defect or variation is immaterial when the effect on price, quantity, quality,
       or delivery is negligible when contrasted with the total cost or scope of the supplies or services being
       acquired. The Department either shall give the bidder an opportunity to cure any deficiency resulting from a
       minor informality or irregularity in a bid or waive the deficiency, whichever is to the advantage of the
       Department.

17.    BIDDER RESPONSIBILITY: The Department will only award this invitation to bid to what it deems to be a
       responsible bidder. The Department’s determination of a bidder’s responsibility includes, but is not limited
       to, the following factors:

            a) experience of the bidder;
            b) bidder’s financial condition;
            c) bidder’s conduct and performance on previous contracts;
            d) the bidder’s facilities;
            e) the bidder’s management skills;
            f) the bidder’s employees;
            g) past experience and/or quality of bidder’s proposed subcontractors;
            h) the bidder’s ability to execute the contract;
            i) review of Federal and Department debarment lists;
            j) bidder has history of successful performance on contracts of similar size and scope; and
            k) current or impending legal actions against a bidder.

 18.   APPARENT CLERICAL MISTAKES: Clerical mistakes apparent on the face of the bid may be corrected,
       at the Department’s discretion, before contract award. The Department first shall obtain from the bidder a
       verification of the information intended and will attach written verification of the mistake by the bidder in the
       contract file and award documents. Example of apparent clerical mistakes are:

       (1) Obvious misplacement of a decimal point or comma;
       (2) Obvious incorrect discount factor; or
       (3) Transcription error in Part Number.

19.    ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The Department reserves the right to request additional information to
       evaluate a bidder’s responsiveness to the Invitation to Bid’s requirements and/or to evaluate a bidder’s
       overall responsibility. These requests may require the bidder’s submission of confidential materials (e.g.
       financial statements). If a bidder does not provide all of the requested information within the prescribed
       timeframe, the Department may find the bid non-responsive and ineligible for award.




                                                                                                                    73
20.   PRODUCT SAMPLES: The Department may require bidders, by Invitation to Bid or by request during bid
      evaluation, to provide sample supplies or equipment or examples of work, at the Bidder’s expense.
      Samples must clearly identify the Bidder, the bid number, and the item the sample represents in the bid.
      The Department will return samples that are not destroyed by testing, at the Bidder's expense, upon the
      Bidder’s timely request. The Department may keep the samples of the Bidder awarded the contract until
      the completion of the contract. Unsolicited samples submitted in response to this Invitation to Bid will not be
      evaluated and the Department may dispose of them in any way it chooses.

21.   SPECIFICATIONS: The Department is authorized by Sections 5513 and/or 125.02(B) of the Ohio Revised
      Code to prepare specifications and establish contracts to obtain the supplies, equipment, and/or services
      referenced within this invitation to bid. The purpose of the provided specifications is to describe the
      supplies, equipment, and/or services to be purchased and will serve as a fair and equitable basis for
      comparison of submitted bids. The Department may use any form of specification it determines to be in the
      best interest of the Department and that best describes the supplies or services to be purchased.
      Specifications may be in the form of a design specification or a combination thereof. If the department
      determines that a design, performance or a combination specification is not in the best interest of the
      Department, it may use brand name or equal specifications.

      Unless otherwise specified in this Invitation to Bid, all products, equipment, supplies, etc. offered by bidders
      must be in a new condition. A ‘new’ product is one that will be first used by the Department after it
      has been manufactured or produced. Used, reconditioned, or previously titled products, supplies, or
      equipment will not be considered for award of this Invitation to Bid.

      The Department uses qualified products list (QPL) and/or approved products lists (APL) developed by
      either itself or other qualified institutions to specify acceptable products and supplies that have been
      through proper application and testing procedures to verify conformance with technical and/or performance
      specifications. Where the Department requires products and supplies to be included on a specific QPL/APL
      listing, the Department will not accept bids for products/supplies that are not included on a specified
      QPL/APL at the time of public bid opening.

      A bidder may not be compensated for damages arising from inaccurate or incomplete information in the
      Invitation to Bid specifications or from inaccurate assumptions based upon the specifications.

22.   USE OF BRAND NAMES: Unless otherwise provided in this solicitation, the name of a certain brand,
      make, or manufacturer does not restrict bidders to the specific brand, make, or manufacturer named, but
      conveys the general style, type, character, and quality of the article desired. Any article which the
      Department, in its sole discretion, determines to be the equivalent of that specified, considering quality,
      workmanship, economy of operation, or suitability for the purpose intended, may be accepted. The bidder
      is responsible to clearly and specifically identify the product being offered and to provide sufficient
      descriptive literature, catalog cuts and technical detail to enable the Department to determine if the product
      offered meets the requirements of the solicitation. Failure to furnish adequate data for evaluation purposes
      may result in declaring a bid nonresponsive. Unless the bidder clearly indicates in its bid that the product
      being offered is an equivalent product, such bid will be considered to offer the exact brand, make, or
      manufacturer name referenced in the bid solicitation.

23.   DEVIATIONS: Statements or modifications made by a bidder in their submitted bid package that deviate
      from this Invitation to Bid’s terms, conditions, specifications and requirements may render a bid non-
      responsive and ineligible for award.

      Acceptance of any deviations or modifications will be confirmed by the Department in writing, if accepted. If
      the Department does not specifically approve submitted deviations or modifications in writing, an award of
      this invitation to bid shall not constitute acceptance of the bidder’s submitted modifications.

24.   ESTIMATED QUANTITIES: Any purchase estimates indicated for bid item(s) are to be considered as
      estimates only. The Department makes no representation or guarantee as to the actual amount of item(s)
      to be purchased by the Department or Political Subdivisions.

25.   OVERLAPPING CONTRACT ITEMS: The products and/or services included in this solicitation may be
      available from other State of Ohio contracts and/or other contracts made available for the Department’s

                                                                                                                  74
      use. The existence of these contracts containing like or similar products and/or services could be either
      known or unknown to the Department at the time this Invitation to bid has been published. Unless
      otherwise stated in this contract, the Department may acquire these products and/or services from any
      available source. The Department will make purchases from sources that are deemed to be in the best
      interest of the Agency.



26.   REJECTION/PARTIAL AWARD OF BIDS: The Department reserves the right to reject any or all bid
      responses, award partial contracts, or choose to rebid when:

              (1) Product, supplies and/or services are not in compliance with the requirements, specifications,
              and terms and conditions set forth in this Invitation to Bid; or

              (2) Pricing offered is determined to be excessive in comparison with existing market conditions, or
              exceeds the available funds of the Department; or

              (3) Only one bid is received, and the Department cannot determine the reasonableness of the bid
              prices submitted; or

              (4) It is determined that the award of any or all items would not be in the best interest of the
              Department; or

              (5) The Department, in its opinion, did not achieve the desired amount of competition amongst
              qualified bidders for the products, supplies, and/or services being offered in the bid solicitation; or

              (6) Inadequate or ambiguous specifications were cited in the bidding documents; or

              (7) The Department determines that specifications and/or requirements were missing from the
              bidding documents; or

              (8) A bidder imposes additional terms and conditions against the Department.

27.   NOTICE TO BIDDERS OF REJECTED BIDS: When the Department deems it necessary to reject a bid,
      the Department will notify each affected bidder and the reasons for such actions.

28.   BID PROTESTS: Any bidder either deemed not responsible or whose bid has been deemed non-
      responsive shall be notified by the Department of that determination and the reasons for it. The notification
      will be provided by the Department in writing and sent by certified U.S. mail and at the email address
      provided on the front cover of this bid. The bidder will have five (5) calendar days after receipt (by mail or
      email confirmation) of this notification to file a written, valid protest of the Department’s determination. A
      valid written protest must contain substantive information and evidence so as to refute the Department’s
      asserted claims against either the bid’s responsiveness or bidder’s responsibility, whichever apply. The
      Department will only review and respond to valid written protests containing substantive information and
      evidence. After review of the valid written protest, the Department will either affirm or reverse its original
      determination.

      If a valid written protest is not received by the Department within five (5) calendar days of receipt, the
      Director of ODOT will move forward awarding the Contract and the affected bidder will have effectively
      waived its right to protest the Department’s decision. For the purposes of this paragraph, “receipt” shall be
      defined as verification (via either certified mail return receipt or electronic read or delivery receipt) that the
      apparent low bidder has received the Department’s written determination against the affected bidder. Upon
      the bidder’s receipt, the five (5) calendar day response deadline shall commence.

29.   DELAYS IN CONTRACT AWARD: Delays in the award of this Invitation to Bid beyond the anticipated
      Contract start date may result in a change in the contract period as indicated in the Special terms and
      conditions of this bid solicitation. In these instances, ODOT shall reserve the right to award a contract

     hereunder, the Work under this Contract that is affected by the lack of funding will terminate and ODOT will
     have no further obligation to make any payments and will be released from its obligations on the date

     expenditure. If the term of this Contract extends beyond a biennium, the Contract will expire at the end of a
     current biennium and the State may renew this Contract in the next biennium by issuing written notice to

     odd-numbered calendar year.

4.   OBM CERTIFICATION: None of the rights, duties, or obligations in this Contract will be binding on the
     Department, and the Vendor will not begin its performance, until all of the following conditions have been

     2. All necessary funds are made available by the Ohio Office of Budget and Management; or

     notice that such funds have been made available.

     between the parties and signed by the Director of ODOT. Amendments or modifications to this Contract
     made between the Vendor and other Department personnel shall be void and unenforceable.

     Contract shall be liberally construed in favor of the effect the purpose of this Contract and the policy and
     purposes of the Department. If any provisions in this Contract are found to be ambiguous, an interpretation
     consistent with the purpose of this Contract that would render the provision valid shall be favored over any
     interpretation that would render it invalid.

7.   GOVERNING LAW / SEVERABILITY: This Contract shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio,

9.    PLACEMENT OF ORDERS/METHODS OF PAYMENT: The Department shall use either State of Ohio
      Purchase Order or State of Ohio Payment Card (i.e. credit card) to authorize performance under this
      Contract and to issue payments for supplies, products, and/or services acquired. Vendors are required to
      accept both forms of payment. For Department purchases over $2,500.00, an official State of Ohio
      purchase order must be generated and obtain approvals from the Office of Budget and Management, the
      Department of Administrative Services, and the Director of Transportation prior to its effectiveness. An
      approved State of Ohio purchase order will be sent to the Vendor and the Vendor will provide the goods
      and/or services listed on the ordering documents and in accordance with the Contract’s terms and
      conditions. Any order placed not using an approved ODOT purchase order or against a State payment
      card, shall not be considered a valid order and may result in denial of payment and/or return of goods at
      the Vendor's expense.

10.   ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS: The Vendor must accept orders placed by the Department pursuant to this
      Contract up through the last day of the Contract’s effectiveness, inclusive of any contract extensions
      exercised or agreed-upon between the Parties.

11.   BLANKET PURCHASE ORDERS: The Department utilizes blanket purchase orders to pre-authorize
      funding for use on Contracts containing bid items that, due to the urgent nature of maintaining the
      Department’s highways and facilities, are critical to the Department executing its mission and objectives.
      The generation of blanket purchase orders are not used by the Department to place a specific order, rather
      as a means to make funding more readily available for use when Contract items are needed. The Vendor
      shall keep all blanket purchase orders on file and make them readily available for use by Department
      personnel to place orders against. When placing orders against a blanket purchase order, the Department
      will telephone or email orders referencing the blanket purchase order and its associated ODOT purchase
      order number. All of the Contract’s terms and conditions shall apply to the Department’s orders referencing
      a blanket purchase order.

      For all blanket purchase orders, quantities and amounts to be purchased from these purchase orders is
      unknown by the Department and Vendors must not construe these purchase orders as a commitment to
      purchase a specific amount of goods and/or services. Accordingly, the Department reserves the right to
      increase or decrease the available funding on these blanket purchase orders at its discretion.

12.   DELIVERY INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE: Upon pick-up or delivery of any supplies, products, and/or
      services, ODOT retains the right to inspect the product/service prior to final acceptance and/or payment for
      the product/service. ODOT shall have sufficient and reasonable time to fully inspect supplies and/or
      services for compliance. The purpose of the inspection process is to ensure that the product/service is in
      compliance with the specifications set forth in the awarded contract. In the event that the product/service
      does not meet the specifications, ODOT shall notify the Vendor for removal/replacement of the product
      and/or service at the Vendor’s expense. ODOT shall retain all rights and remedies as described herein.
      Wherein products ordered by ODOT are delivered to a facility, which is not owned by ODOT and where
      ODOT has contracted with this facility to take delivery of products ordered by ODOT, acceptance will occur
      when the products have been inspected and accepted by ODOT within a reasonable amount of time after
      delivery to the facility. ODOT shall not be responsible for any storage costs incurred prior to the inspection
      and acceptance.

13.   RETURN GOODS POLICY: The Department will apply the following Return Goods Policy on all purchases
      made under the Contract:

              (A) Return goods, when due to Vendor debar (i.e. over-shipment, defective merchandise,
              unapproved substitution, etc.) shall be returned to the Vendor, at the Vendor’s expense. The
              Vendor shall make arrangements to remove the return goods from the Department’s premises
              within five (5) calendar days after notification. The Vendor shall not apply any restocking or other
              charges to the Department. At the option of the Department, replacement items may be accepted
              and will be shipped within five (5) calendar days of notification. Failure of the Vendor to arrange for
              return of the items within the specified time will result in the items being deemed as abandoned
              property and the Department will dispose of accordingly.




                                                                                                                 80
              (B) For orders of custom manufactured items, the Vendor will provide a production sample of the
              item to the Department for acceptance. The production sample will be identical to the item to be
              provided. The Department will provide written acceptance of the item prior to the Vendor continuing
              with production. Once delivery and acceptance has been completed and the Department
              determines for any reason that any remaining quantities will not be used, the agency may request
              the return of the custom manufactured items. Acceptance of the return of custom manufactured
              items will be at the option of the Vendor. If the Vendor agrees to the return of these items, the
              Department will be responsible for all costs associated with packaging, shipment and
              transportation, to include the original shipment to the Department and subsequent return of goods
              to the location designated by the Vendor. The Vendor may assess restocking fees that are
              equivalent to restocking fees that are normally assessed to other customers or as published by the
              Vendor. Failure of the Vendor to provide a production sample and obtain written approval from the
              Department will result in the Vendor bearing all responsibility and costs associated with the return
              of these goods.

              (C) Return goods of regular catalog stock merchandise, when due to Department error (i.e. over
              purchase, discontinued use, inventory reduction, etc.) will be accepted by the Vendor if notice is
              given by the Department within six (6) months of delivery and acceptance. All items to be returned
              must be unused and in their original containers and in suitable condition for resale. The
              Department will be responsible for all transportation costs associated with both the original
              shipment of items to the agency and the subsequent return of the items to the location designated
              by the Vendor. The Vendor may assess a restocking fee (not to exceed 10%) associated with the
              return of the items to the location designated by the Vendor. Return of regular stock catalog
              merchandise, when delivery and acceptance exceed six (6) months will be at the option of the
              Vendor.

14.   PRODUCT RECALLS: In the event product delivered has been recalled, seized, or embargoed and/or has
      been determined to be misbranded, adulterated, or found to be unfit for human consumption by the packer,
      processor, manufacturer or by any Department or Federal regulatory agency, the Vendor shall be
      responsible to notify the ODOT Office of Contract Sales, Purchasing Services section and all other ordering
      agencies/entities within two business days after notice has been given. Vendor shall, at the option of the
      Department, either reimburse the purchase price or provide an equivalent replacement product at no
      additional cost. Vendor shall be responsible for removal and/or replacement of the affected product within a
      reasonable time as determined by the ordering agency. At the option of the ordering agency, Vendor may
      be required to reimburse storage and/or handling fees to be calculated from time of delivery and
      acceptance to actual removal. Vendor will bear all costs associated with the removal and proper disposal of
      the affected product. Failure to reimburse the purchase price or provide equivalent replacement product will
      be considered a default.

15.   PRODUCT SUBSTITUTION: In the event a specified product listed in the Contract becomes unavailable or
      cannot be supplied by the Vendor for any reason (except as provided for in the Force Majeure clause), a
      product deemed in writing by the Department to be equal to or better than the specified product must be
      substituted by the Vendor at no additional cost or expense to the Department. Unless otherwise specified,
      any substitution of product prior to the Department’s written approval may be cause for termination of
      Contract.

      The Department reserves the right to deny any substitution request that it is deemed to not be in the best
      interest of the Department. In these instances, the Department may seek substitute products from another
      supplier and assess the difference in cost, if any, as damages against the Vendor for their material breach.

16.   INVOICE REQUIREMENTS: The Vendor must submit an original, proper invoice to the office designated
      on the purchase order as the “bill to” address. To be a proper invoice, the invoice must include the following
      information: 1. The ODOT purchase order number authorizing the delivery of products or services. 2. A
      description of what the Vendor delivered, including, as applicable, the time period, serial number, unit price,
      quantity, and total price of the products and services. 3. The Contract number pursuant to the deliverable.




                                                                                                                 81

      Department shall postpone payment pursuant to Section 126.30 of the Ohio Revised Code. Invoices shall
      be returned to the Vendor noting areas for correction. If such notification of defect is sent, the required
      payment date shall be thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the corrected invoice.

18.   PAYMENT DUE DATE: Payments under this Contract will be due on the 30th calendar day after the date
      of actual receipt of a proper invoice in the office designated to receive the invoice, or the date the service is
      delivered and accepted in accordance with the terms of this Contract. The date of the warrant issued in
      payment will be considered the date payment is made. Interest on late payments will be paid in accordance
      with O.R.C. Section 126.30.

19.   INSURANCE POLICIES: By way of provision in this Contract to maintain specific minimum levels of
      insurance coverage(s) (e.g. Commercial General liability, Auto liability, Public liability, Property Damage,
      etc.), the Vendor shall provide to Department upon request evidence of such insurance required to be
      carried by these provisions, including any endorsement affecting the additional insured status, is in full
      force and effect and that premiums therefore have been paid. Such evidence shall be furnished by the
      Vendor within two (2) business days and on the insurance industry's standard ACORD Form (Certificate of
      Insurance) or a certified copy of the original policy. The Certificate of Insurance or certified copy of the
      policy must contain an endorsement naming the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation, its officers,
      agents, employees, and servants as additionally insured, but only with respect to Work performed for the
      Department under this Contract, at no cost to Department. Vendor shall notify the Department within ten
      (10) calendar days of receipt of a notice of cancellation, expiration, or any reduction in coverage, or if the

      insolvent. Vendor shall provide to the Department evidence of a replacement policy at least five (5)
      calendar days prior to the effective date of such cancellation, expiration, or reduction in coverage.

      All required insurance policies shall be maintained at Vendor’s sole expense and in full force for the
      complete term of the Contract, including any warranty periods. Reference 107.12 the Construction &
      Materials Specification handbook.

20.   TAXATION: ODOT is exempt from federal excise taxes and all Department and local taxes, unless
      otherwise provided herein. ODOT does not agree to pay any taxes on commodities, goods, or services
      acquired from any Vendor.

21.   CONTRACT TERMINATION: If a Vendor fails to perform any one of its obligations under this Contract, it
      will be in breach of contract and the Department may terminate this Contract in accordance with this
      section. Notices of contract termination shall be made in writing. The termination will be effective on the
      date delineated by the Department.

              a. Termination for Breach. If Vendor’s breach is unable to be cured in a reasonable time, the
              Department may terminate the Contract by written notice to the Vendor.

              b. Termination for Un-remedied Breach. If Vendor’s breach may be cured within a reasonable
              time, the Department will provide written notice to Vendor specifying the breach and the time within
              which Vendor must correct the breach. If Vendor fails to cure the specified breach within the time
              required, the Department may terminate the Contract. If the Department does not give timely notice
              of breach to Vendor, the Department has not waived any of the Department’s rights or remedies
              concerning the breach.

               c. Termination for Persistent Breach. The Department may terminate this Contract by written
              notice to Vendor for defaults that are cured, but persistent. “Persistent” means three or more
              breaches. After the Department has notified Vendor of its third breach, the Department may
              terminate this Contract without providing Vendor with an opportunity to cure. The three or more
              breaches are not required to be related to each other in any way.

              d. Termination for Endangered Performance. The Department may terminate this Contract by
              written notice to the Vendor if the Department determines that the performance of the Contract is
              endangered through no fault of the Department.


                                                                                                                   82
              e. Termination for Financial Instability. The Department may terminate this Contract by written
              notice to the Vendor if a petition in bankruptcy or a Federal or State tax lien has been filed by or
              against the Vendor.

               f. Termination for Delinquency, Violation of Law. The Department may terminate this Contract
              by written notice, if it determines that Vendor is delinquent in its payment of federal, Department or
              local taxes, workers’ compensation, insurance premiums, unemployment compensation
              contributions, child support, court costs or any other obligation owed to a Department agency or
              political subdivision. The Department also may cancel this Contract, if it determines that Vendor
              has violated any law during the performance of this Contract. However, the Department may not
              terminate this Contract if the Vendor has entered into a repayment agreement with which the
              Vendor is current.

               g. Termination for Subcontractor Breach. The Department may terminate this Contract for the
              breach of the Vendor or any of its subcontractors. The Vendor will be solely responsible for
              satisfying any claims of its subcontractors for any suspension or termination and will indemnify the
              Department for any liability to them. Subcontractors will hold the Department harmless for any
              damage caused to them from a suspension or termination. The subcontractors will look solely to
              the Vendor for any compensation to which they may be entitled.

              h. Termination for Vendor’s Failure to Pay Material Suppliers. Pursuant to Section 4113.61 of
              the Ohio Revised Code, Vendors shall promptly pay material suppliers, within ten (10) calendar
              days of receipt of payment from the State of Ohio, for materials ordered and delivered as a result of
              this contract. A Vendor unable to furnish bid items because of non-payment issues related to a
              material supplier shall constitute grounds for the Director of ODOT to terminate this contract
              immediately. A Vendor may, at the discretion of the Department, be given an amount of time,
              amount shall be specified by the Department in writing, to furnish past due payment to the material
              supplier before termination shall occur.

              j. Failure to Maintain MBE Certification. Pursuant to O.R.C. Section 125.081, the State may set
              aside a bid for supplies or services for participation only by minority business enterprises (MBE’s)
              certified by the State of Ohio, Equal Opportunity Coordinator. After award of the Contract, it is the
              responsibility of the MBE Vendor to maintain certification as a MBE. If the Vendor fails to renew its
              certification and/or is decertified by the State of Ohio, Equal Opportunity Coordinator, the State
              may immediately cancel the Contract.

              k. Failure to Maintain Licensure. The Vendor’s failure to maintain the proper license(s) to perform
              the services or provide the goods prescribed by this Contract shall be grounds to terminate this
              Contract without prior notice.

              l. Qualified Products Listing and Approved Products Listing. Any products or supplies
              removed from a specific qualified products listing/approved product listing, by either the
              Department, government, or governing body throughout the duration of the Contract shall be
              removed from the Contract effective on the date of removal from the respective listing.

22.   NOTICE OF BREACH: Each party of this Contract has an obligation to provide written notice when it is
      determined by one party that the other party is in default of this Contract. A notice of ODOT’s default of this
      Contract must be sent to the Procurement Manager of the ODOT Office of Contract Sales.

23.   CONTRACT SUSPENSION: A Vendor who fails to perform any one of its obligations under this Contract
      will be in breach. In these instances, ODOT may choose to suspend the Vendor from the contract rather
      than terminate the Contract.

      In the case of a suspension for ODOT’s convenience, the amount of compensation due the Vendor for
      work performed before the suspension will be determined in the same manner as provided in this section
      for termination for ODOT’s convenience or the Vendor may be entitled to compensation for work performed
      before the suspension, less any damage to ODOT resulting from the Vendor’s breach of this Contract or
      other fault.


                                                                                                                 83
      The notice of suspension, whether with or without cause, will be effective immediately on the Vendor’s
      receipt of the notice. The Vendor will immediately prepare a report and deliver it to ODOT which will
      include a detailed description of work completed, percentage of project completion, estimated time for
      delivery of all orders received to date, and costs incurred by the Vendor.

24.   CANCELLATION FOR CONVENIENCE: The Department reserves the right to cancel and terminate this
      Contract, in whole or in part, without penalty, upon thirty (30) days written notice to an awarded vendor. In
      the event the initial contract period is for more than 12 months, the resulting contract may be terminated by
      either party, without penalty, after the initial 12 months of the contract period and upon a minimum of sixty
      (60) days written notice to the other party. Cancellations exercised in accordance with this section shall not
      relieve the Vendor of the obligation to deliver and/or perform on all outstanding orders issued prior to the
      effective date of cancellation.

25.   CONTRACT DAMAGES: The Department may assess, at a minimum but not limited to, the following
      damages against a Vendor:

              A.       ACTUAL DAMAGES: Vendor is liable to the State of Ohio for all actual and direct
              damages caused by Vendor’s breach. The Department may substitute supplies or services, from a
              third party, for those that were to be provided by Vendor. In accordance with Ohio Revised Code
              §5513.05(c), the Department may recover the costs associated with acquiring substitute supplies
              or services, less any expenses or costs saved by Vendor’s breach, from Vendor.

              B.       LIQUIDATED DAMAGES: If actual and direct damages are uncertain or difficult to
              determine, the Department may recover liquidated damages in the amount of 1% of the value of
              the order, deliverable or milestone that is the subject of the breach for every day that the breach is
              not cured by the Vendor. If Delay of the cure is caused by ODOT, the delivery date shall be
              extended accordingly to offset such delays. Approval to extend any scheduled delivery date(s)
              shall be at the sole discretion of ODOT.

              C.      DEDUCTION OF DAMAGES FROM CONTRACT PRICE: The Department may deduct all
              or any part of the damages resulting from Vendor’s breach from any part of the price still due on
              the contract, upon prior written notice issued to the Vendor by the Department.

              D. INCIDENTAL/CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES: Pursuant to Section 5513.05 of the Ohio
              Revised Code, the Department may recover from a Vendor who fails to promptly provide
              conforming articles, any incidental or consequential damages as defined in Section 1302.89 of the
              Ohio Revised Code, incurred by the Department in promptly obtaining the conforming articles.

26.   CONTRACT TERM EXTENSIONS: ODOT reserves the right to unilaterally extend this Contract up to one
      (1) calendar month beyond the original contract expiration date at the original unit bid prices awarded.
      Contract extensions beyond one (1) calendar month shall be executed by means of written, mutual
      agreement with the Contract Vendor.

27.   FIRM, FIXED PRICE CONTRACT: Unless otherwise specified in the bidding documents, this Contract is a
      Firm, Fixed-Price Contract. The Vendor will be required to provide to the Department with the materials,
      supplies, equipment and/or services at the awarded bid price(s) for the entire duration of the contract, and
      any extensions thereto.

28.   FORCE MAJEURE: If the Department or Vendor is unable to perform any part of its obligations under this
      Contract by reason of force majeure, the party will be excused from its obligations, to the extent that its
      performance is prevented by force majeure, for the duration of the event. The party must remedy with all
      reasonable dispatch the cause preventing it from carrying out its obligations under this Contract. The term
      “force majeure” means without limitation: acts of God; such as epidemics; lightning; earthquakes; fires;
      storms; hurricanes; tornadoes; floods; washouts; droughts; any other severe weather; explosions; restraint
      of government and people; war; labor strikes; and other like events.

30.   ANTITRUST ASSIGNMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT: Vendor assigns to the State of Ohio, through the
      Department of Transportation, all of its rights to any claims and causes of action the Vendor now has or
      may acquire under Department or federal antitrust laws if the claims or causes of action relate to the
      supplies or services provided under this Contract. Additionally, the State of Ohio will not pay excess
      charges resulting from antitrust violations by Vendor’s suppliers and subcontractors.

31.   CONFIDENTIALITY: The Vendor may learn of information, documents, data, records, or other material that
      is confidential in the performance of this Contract. The Vendor may not disclose any information obtained
      by it as a result of this Contract, without the written permission of the Department. The Vendor must
      assume that all Department information, documents, data, records or other material is confidential.

      The Vendor’s obligation to maintain the confidentiality of the information will not apply where it: (1) was
      already in the Vendor’s possession before disclosure by the Department, and it was received by the
      Vendor without the obligation of confidence; (2) is independently developed by the Vendor; (3) is or
      becomes publicly available without breach of this Contract; (4) is rightfully received by the Vendor from a
      third party without an obligation of confidence; (5) is disclosed by the Vendor with the written consent of the
      Department; or (6) is released in accordance with a valid order of a court or governmental agency, provided
      that the Vendor (a) notifies the Department of such order immediately upon receipt of the order and (b)
      makes a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order from the issuing court or agency limiting disclosure
      and use of the confidential information solely for the purposes intended to be serviced by the original order
      of production. The Vendor will return all originals of any information and destroy any copies it has made on
      termination or expiration of this Contract.

      The Vendor will be liable for the disclosure of any confidential information. The parties agree that the
      disclosure of confidential information of the Department’s may cause the Department irreparable damage
      for which remedies other than injunctive relief may be inadequate, and the Vendor agrees that in the event
      of a breach of the obligations hereunder, the Department shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
      injunctive relief to enforce this provision without the necessity of providing actual damages. This provision
      shall not, however, diminish or alter any right to claim and recover.

32.   DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE: The Vendor agrees to comply with all applicable Department and federal
      laws regarding drug-free workplace and shall make a good faith effort to ensure that all its employees,
      while working on Department property, will not purchase, transfer, use or possess illegal drugs or alcohol or
      abuse prescription drugs in any way.

33.   WORKERS’ COMPENSATION: Workers’ compensation insurance, as required by Ohio law or the laws of
      any other Department where work under this Contract will be done. The Vendor will also maintain
      employer’s liability insurance with at least a $1,000,000.00 limit.

34.   OHIO ETHICS LAW: Vendor agrees that it is currently in compliance and will continue to adhere to the
      requirements of Ohio Ethics law as provided by Section 102.03 and 102.04 of the Ohio Revised Code.

35.   PUBLICITY: The Vendor will not advertise that it is doing business with the Department or use this
      Contract as a marketing or sales tool without prior, written consent of the Department. This provision
      includes marketing or sales tools related to the ODOT Cooperative Purchasing Program.

36.   STRICT PERFORMANCE: The failure of either party, at any time to demand strict performance by the
      other party of any of the terms of this Contract, will not be construed as a waiver of any such term and
      either party may at any time demand strict and complete performance by the other party.

37.   SUBCONTRACTING. The Department recognizes that it may be necessary for the Vendor to use
      subcontractors to perform portions of the work under the Contract. In those circumstances, the Vendor
      shall submit a list identifying its subcontractors or joint venture partners performing portions of the work
      under the Contract. If any changes occur during the term of the Contract, the Vendor shall supplement its
      list of subcontractors or joint venture business partners. In addition, all subcontractors or joint venture
      business partners agree to be bound by all of the Terms and Conditions and specifications of the Contract.
      The Department reserves the right to reject any subcontractor submitted by the Vendor. All subcontracts
      will be at the sole expense of the Vendor and the Vendor will be solely responsible for payment of its

                                                                                                                 85

              products or supplies. The Vendor will also indemnify the Department for any direct damages and

        becomes involved in, or is threatened with litigation by a subcontractor, or supplier because of such
        direction, the Vendor may request ODOT to enter into any litigation to protect the interests of
        ODOT. In addition, the Vendor may request the United States to enter into the litigation to protect
        the interests of the United States.
