___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender’s assistance. Applicants should complete this form as “Borrower” or “Co-Borrower,” as applicable. Co-Borrower
information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when the income or assets of a person other than the Borrower (including the Borrower’s spouse) will be used as a basis for loan
qualification or ✔ the income or assets of the Borrower’s spouse or other person who has community property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her
liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person has community property rights pursuant to applicable law and Borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is
located in a community property state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

If this is an application for joint credit, Borrower and Co-Borrower each agree that we intend to apply for joint credit (sign below):

In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender mist disclose to
you the scope that a consumer reporting agency distributed to users and the
lender used in connection with your home loan, and the key factors affecting
your credit scores.

The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of
the request and based on information that a consumer reporting agency or
lender has on file. The scores are based on data about credit history and
payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist
the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used
to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit
scores can change over time depending on your conduct, how you credit
history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies
change.

If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is
furnished to you, contact the consumer reporting agency at the address and
telephone number provided with this notice, or contact the lender, if the lender
developed or generated the credit score. The consumer reporting agency
plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is
unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision on a loan
application

If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the lender.
