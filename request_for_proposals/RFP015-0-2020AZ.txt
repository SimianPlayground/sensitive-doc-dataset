   I. PURPOSE
   The purpose of this RFP is to solicit Sealed Proposals from qualified Offerors to provide electronic forms solution.

    II. BACKGROUND
   Newport News Public Schools (NNPS) is located within the co-terminus boundaries of the City of Newport News,
   Virginia. NNPS educates 28,650 students in 4 early childhood centers, 24 elementary schools, 7 middle schools, 1
   middle high combination school, and 5 high schools. There are also programs available for at-risk students in

   teachers. A listing of NNPS and their locations may be accessed via NNPS’s official web site at
   http://sbo.nn.k12.va.us/schools.

   NNPS is currently using paper forms; manually entering data and information, and scanning the forms into the ECM
   (Electronic Content Management) system. However, NNPS is planning to move toward a paperless system that
   would enable NNPS and its customers to create and share digital forms with mobile, remote, and local teams. Key
   features should include data capture, remote access, auto-save, e-signatures, and form widgets.

   Proposals should match or offer similar benefits with any deviations clearly noted.

   Provider or its affiliates.

     offer to work offline and share the saved data with teams when connected to the network. Additionally, the
     software solution should also offer mobile applications for Android and iOS devices.

    B.   Minimum requirements
   o The proposed e-forms software solution must be able to integrate with our current systems such as;
       - Electronic Content Management (ECM) system (no version info available, provider sends out periodic

       - Hire Enterprise, and Human Resource Information System (HRIS) (no version info available, provider sends
         out periodic updates).
   o Forms must be tablet and iPad friendly.
   o Forms must be iOS and Android compatible.
   o System must offer mobile applications.
   o System must offer auto-save and work-offline features.
   o Forms must be easily accessible for both internal and external users.
   o Forms must allow for electronic signature.
   o Software must be able to create custom forms and work with prefab forms (I-9, tax forms, and etc.).

     JJ. Vendor’s Invoices:
       Successful Offeror shall submit to NNPS all invoices promptly upon completion of the requirements for
       installation, delivery, and acceptance of the Products and Services required under this contract. Invoices shall

      agreement shall be decided by the NNPS Purchasing Agent, who shall reduce his decision to writing and mail or

      Purchasing Agent shall be final and conclusive unless the contractor appeals within six (6) months of the date of
      the final written decision by instituting legal action as provided in the Code of Virginia. A contractor may not
      institute legal action, prior to receipt of the public body's decision on the claim, unless the public body fails to
      render such decision within the time specified. Contractual claims, whether for money or other relief, shall be
      submitted in writing no later than sixty days after final payment; however, written notice of the contractor's
      intention to file such claim shall have been given at the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon
      which the claim is based. Nothing herein shall preclude a contract from requiring submission of an invoice for
      final payment within a certain time after completion and acceptance of the work or acceptance of the goods.
      Pendency of claims shall not delay payment of amounts agreed due in the final payment.

     LL. Warranty/Guarantee:

      Offeror or Successful Offeror’s workmen are responsible, to the building or equipment, to Successful Offeror’s
      own work, or to the work of others. Any merchandise or service provided under the contract which is or
      becomes defective during the warranty period shall be replaced by the Successful Offeror free of charge with the
      specific understanding that all replacements shall carry the same guarantee as the original equipment or service
      (one year or manufacturer’s standard warranty period, whichever is greater, from the date of acceptance of the
      replacement). Successful Offeror shall make any such replacement immediately upon receiving notice from
      NNPS.

     MM. Payment Terms:

      be completed and accepted by NNPS. NNPS agrees to make payments under this contract within thirty (30)
      days after receipt of a correct invoice for such payment. Where payment is made by mail, the date of postmark
      shall be deemed to be the date of payment. Any amounts due NNPS under the terms of this or any other
      agreement may be applied against Successful Offeror’s invoices with documentation for the basis of the


RFP #015-0-2020/AZ                                                                                     Page 14 of 24
       adjustment attached. In no event shall any interest penalty or late fee accrue when payment is delayed because
       of disagreement between NNPS and Successful Offeror regarding the quantity, quality, time of delivery, or other
       noncompliance with the contract requirements for any Product or Service or the accuracy or correctness of any
       invoice. Payment terms offering a "prompt payment discount" of 20 days or greater will be considered in the
       evaluation of Proposals. All other payment terms shall be net thirty (30) calendar days or greater. Payment
       terms not specified by Offeror shall be Net 45 days.

       Special Educational or Promotional Discounts
       Successful Offeror shall extend any special educational or promotional sale prices or discounts immediately to
       NNPS during the term of the contract. Such notice shall also advise the duration of the specific sale or discount
       price.

     NN. Prompt Payment:
      NNPS will promptly pay for completed, delivered goods or services accepted under this Contract by the
      payment date established. The required payment date will be either: (i) the date on which payment is due under
      the terms of this Contract for the provision of the goods or services; or (ii) if a date is not established by this
      Contract, not more than forty-five (45) days after goods or services are received or not more than forty-five (45)
      days after the invoice is rendered, whichever is later.

       Within twenty (20) days after the receipt of the invoice or goods or services, NNPS shall notify the supplier of
       any defect or impropriety that would prevent payment by the payment date. Should NNPS fail to pay the
       Contractor by the pay date, finance charges may be assessed by the Contractor. Unless otherwise provided
       under the terms of this Contract, interest will accrue at the rate of one percent (1%) per month. This will not
       apply to late payment provisions in any public utility tariffs or public utility negotiated Contracts. Contractor
       shall include in each of its subcontracts a provision requiring each subcontractor to include or otherwise be
       subject to the same payment and interest requirements with respect to each lower-tier subcontractor.

       In cases where payment to Contractor is made by mail, the date of postmark shall be deemed to be the date
       payment is made for purposes of this Contract.

       Individual Contractors shall provide to NNPS their social security numbers and proprietorships, partnerships,
       and corporations to provide their federal employer identification numbers.

       Within seven (7) days after Contractor receives payment from NNPS, Contractor shall take one or more of the
       following actions:

       1. Pay all subcontractors for the proportionate share of the total payment received from NNPS attributable to
          the work performed by the subcontractors under this Contract;
       2. Notify NNPS and all affected subcontractors, in writing, of Contractor’s intention to withhold all or a part of
          each affected subcontractor’s payment including the reason for nonpayment.
       3. Pay interest to the subcontractor on all amounts owed by the Contractor that remain unpaid after (7) seven
          days following receipt by the Contractor of payment from NNPS for work performed by the subcontractor
          under that Contract, except for amounts withheld, as allowed in #2 above.

       A Contractor's obligation to pay an interest charge to a subcontractor pursuant to the payment clause in this
       section shall not be construed to be an obligation of NNPS. A Contract modification will not be made for the
       purpose of providing reimbursement by NNPS for interest charges owed by Contractor. A cost reimbursement
       claim to NNPS shall not include any amounts for reimbursement of interest charges owed by Contractor.

     OO.     Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)



RFP #015-0-2020/AZ                                                                                     Page 15 of 24
   (a) Method of payment.

      (1) All payments by Newport News Public Schools (NNPS) under this contract shall be made by electronic funds
    transfer (EFT) except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term “EFT” refers to
    the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
      (2) In the event NNPS is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either—
         (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
         (ii) Request NNPS to extend payment due dates until such time NNPS makes payment by EFT (but see
         paragraph (d) of this clause).
  (b) Mandatory submission of Contractor's EFT information.
      (1) The Contractor is required to provide NNPS with the information required to make payment by EFT (see
      paragraph (j) of this clause). The Contractor shall provide this information directly to the NNPS Accounting
      Department (hereafter referred to as “Accounting”) no later than 15 days prior to submission of the first request
      for payment. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the
      updated information to the Accounting.
      (2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically
      state the applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to Accounting.
  (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. NNPS may make payment by EFT through the Automated Clearing House (ACH)
  network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association
  (d) Suspension of payment.
      (1) The NNPS is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by Accounting, of the
      correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or
      contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this
      contract.
      (2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, NNPS shall begin using the
      changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by Accounting to the extent payment is made by
      EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is
      implemented by Accounting. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of
      this contract, the Contractor’s request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days
      of the suspension.
  (e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.
      (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because NNPS used the Contractor’s EFT information
      incorrectly, NNPS remains responsible for—
         (i) Making a correct payment;
         (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
         (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
      (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor’s EFT information was incorrect, or was
      revised within 30 days of NNPS’ release of the EFT payment transaction, and—
         (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of Accounting, NNPS is deemed to have made payment and the
         Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
         (ii) If the funds remain under the control of Accounting, NNPS shall not make payment and the provisions of
         paragraph (d) shall apply.
  (f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with
  the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal


RFP #015-0-2020/AZ                                                                                     Page 16 of 24
  Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date,
  provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
  (g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the
  assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that
  the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (j) of this clause to Accounting, and shall be
  paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to
  the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other
  than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to NNPS, is incorrect EFT
  information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
  (h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. NNPS is not liable for errors resulting from changes to
  EFT information provided by the Contractor’s financial agent.
  (i) Payment information. Accounting shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable
  for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. NNPS may request the
  Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and
  methods Accounting is capable of executing. However, NNPS does not guarantee that any particular format or
  method of delivery is available and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to
  NNPS. If NNPS makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, NNPS shall mail the
  payment information to the remittance address in the contract.
  (j) EFT information. The Contractor shall provide the following information to Accounting. The Contractor may
  supply this data for this or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause). The Contractor shall designate a
  single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing the EFT information using the EFT methods
  described in paragraph (c) of this clause.
      (1) The contract number (or other procurement identification number).
      (2) The Contractor’s name and remittance address, as stated in the contract(s).
      (3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the Contractor official
    authorized to provide this information.
      (4) The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the Contractor’s financial agent.
      (5) The Contractor’s account number and the type of account (checking, saving, or lockbox).
      (6) If applicable, the Fedwire Transfer System telegraphic abbreviation of the Contractor’s financial agent.
      (7) If applicable, the Contractor shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing
      Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the Contractor’s
      financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fedwire Transfer System; and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire
      transfer payment.

       part of the Vendor's designated backup and recovery processes and encrypted in accordance with “6. Data
       Encryption”.
       5. Data Transmission. Vendor agrees that any and all electronic transmission or exchange of system and

       means (using HTTPS or SFTP or equivalent) and solely in accordance with “7. Data Re-Use”.
       6. Data Encryption. Vendor agrees to store all NNPS backup data as part of its designated backup and recovery
       processes in encrypted form, using a commercially supported encryption solution. Vendor further agrees that
       any and all NNPS data defined as personally identifiable information under current legislation or regulations
       stored on any portable or laptop computing device or any portable storage medium be likewise encrypted.
       Encryption solutions will be deployed with no less than a 128-bit key for symmetric encryption and a 1024 (or
       larger) bit key length for asymmetric encryption.

       7. Data Re-Use. Vendor agrees that any and all data exchanged shall be used expressly and solely for the
       purposes enumerated in the Current Agreement and this Addendum. Data shall not be distributed, repurposed or
       shared across other applications, environments, or business units of Vendor. Vendor further agrees that no
       NNPS data of any kind shall be transmitted, exchanged or otherwise passed to other vendors or interested parties
       except on a case-by-case basis as specifically agreed to in writing by Newport News Public Schools.
       8. End of Agreement Data Handling. Vendor agrees that upon termination of this Agreement it shall erase,

       of individuals in the event of unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other event requiring
       notification. In the event of a breach of any of Vendor’s security obligations, or other event requiring
       notification under applicable law, Vendor agrees to:
            a. Notify NNPS by telephone and e-mail of such an event within 24 hours of discovery, and;
            b. Assume responsibility for informing all such individuals in accordance with applicable law, and;
            c. Indemnify, hold harmless and defend NNPS and its trustees, officers, and employees from and against
       any claims, damages, or other harm related to such Notification Event.
       10. Right to Audit. Newport News Public Schools or an appointed audit firm (Auditors) has the right to audit
       the Vendor and the Vendor’s sub-vendors or affiliates that provide a service for the processing, transport or
       storage of Newport News Public Schools’ data. Newport News Public Schools will announce their intent to
       audit the Vendor by providing at a minimum two weeks (10 business days) notice to the Vendor. This notice
       will go to the Vendor that this contract is executed with. A scope document along with a request for
       deliverables will be provided at the time of notification of an audit. If the documentation requested cannot be
       removed from the Vendor’s premises, the Vendor will allow the Auditors access to their site. Where necessary,
       the Vendor will provide a personal site guide for the Auditors while on site. The Vendor will provide a private
       accommodation on site for data analysis and meetings; the accommodation will allow for a reasonable
       workspace, with appropriate lighting, electrical, a printer and Internet connectivity. The Vendor will make
       necessary employees or contractors available for interviews in person or on the phone during the time frame of
       the audit. In lieu of NNPS or its appointed audit firm performing their own audit, if the Vendor has an external
       audit firm that performs a certified SSAE16 SOC Type II review, NNPS has the right to review the controls
       tested as
       well as the results, and has the right to request additional controls to be added to the certified
       SSAE16 SOC Type II review for testing the controls that have an impact on NNPS data. Audits will be at
       Newport News Public Schools’ sole expense, except where the audit reveals material
       noncompliance with contract specifications, in which case the cost will be borne by the vendor.

       11. Industry Standards. Generally recognized industry standards include but are not limited to the current
       standards and benchmarks set forth and maintained by the:
