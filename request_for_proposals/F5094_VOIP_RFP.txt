                    Disclosure of Prior Non-Responsibility Determinations

 Background:

 New York State Finance Law §139-k(2) obligates Hudson River Park Trust to obtain specific
 information regarding prior non-responsibility determinations with respect to State Finance Law
 §139-j. This information must be collected in addition to the information that is separately
 obtained pursuant to State Finance Law §163(9). In accordance with State Finance Law §139-k,
 an Offerer must be asked to disclose whether there has been a finding of non-responsibility made
 within the previous four (4) years by any Governmental Entity due to: (a) a violation of State
 Finance Law §139-j or (b) the intentional provision of false or incomplete information to a
 Governmental Entity. The terms “Offerer” and “Governmental Entity” are defined in State
 Finance Law § 139-k(1). State Finance Law §139-j sets forth detailed requirements about the
 restrictions on Contacts during the procurement process. A violation of State Finance Law §139-
 j includes, but is not limited to, an impermissible Contact during the restricted period (for
 example, contacting a person or entity other than the designated contact person, when such
 contact does not fall within one of the exemptions).

 As part of its responsibility determination, State Finance Law §139-k(3) mandates consideration
 of whether an Offerer fails to timely disclose accurate or complete information regarding the
 above non-responsibility determination. In accordance with law, no Procurement Contract shall
 be awarded to any Offerer that fails to timely disclose accurate or complete information under
 this section, unless a finding is made that the award of the Procurement Contract to the Offerer is
 necessary to protect public property or public health safety, and that the Offerer is the only
 source capable of supplying the required Article of Procurement within the necessary timeframe.
 See State Finance Law §§139-j (10)(b) and 139-k(3).

                                           ARTICLE I
                                    PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES

1. Supervision by the Trust. Services shall be subject to the general supervision and direction of the
    Trust or its authorized representative, whose decision shall be final and binding upon the Contractor
    as to all matters arising in connection with or relating to the Contract. Neither the Trust’s exercise
    nor failure to exercise such supervision and direction shall relieve the Contractor of any of its
    obligations or responsibilities for its acts or failure to act with regards to the Contract. The Trust shall
    reasonably determine all matters relative to the fulfillment of the Contract on the part of the
    Contractor and such determination shall be final and binding on the Contractor.

2. Approvals or Acceptance by the Trust. Whenever action is to be taken, or approval or acceptance
    given by the Trust, such action, approval or acceptance shall be deemed to have been taken or given,
    only if so taken or given by the Trust’s representative, by the official of the Trust who signed the
    Contract on behalf of the Trust, or by another officer or employee of the Trust duly designated by
    such signing officer to represent the Trust in connection therewith. The Trust shall notify the
    Contractor in writing of the giving or withholding of each such approval or acceptance within a
    reasonable period of time. The Trust’s acceptance or approval of documents or other materials
    prepared by the Contractor hereunder shall in no way relieve the Contractor of responsibility for such
    materials.

3. Contractor Cooperation. The Contractor shall work with and exchange information with such
    entities or individuals in connection with the Services as the Trust shall designate from time to time,
    and agrees to meet with such entities or individuals at such times as the Trust may require in order to
    maintain an ongoing review process to expedite determinations and approvals required to be made in
    connection with the Services.

4. Contact Persons. The Trust will designate in writing an individual who will serve as the Trust’s
    representative and normal point of contact for the Contractor with regards to the Contract and the
    Contractor’s Services and obligations hereunder. The Contractor shall designate in writing to the
    Trust one individual, satisfactory to the Trust, who shall be responsible for coordinating all Services
    to be rendered by the Contractor and who shall be the Trust’s normal point of contact with the
    Contractor on matters relating to such Services. Such individual shall be replaced upon the Trust’s
    written request. The Trust and Contractor may from time to time change this designation by
    notification to the other party.

5. Approval of Subcontractors and Subcontracts. The Contractor shall not employ, contract with or
    use the services of any consultant, contractor, or other third party (collectively “Subcontractor(s)”)
    in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Contract without the prior written
    consent of the Trust. The Contractor shall inform the Trust in writing of the name, proposed service to
    be rendered, and compensation of the Subcontractors, and of any interest it may have in the proposed
    Subcontractors. The Contractor shall be responsible for the performance of the Services of any
    Subcontractors engaged, including the maintenance of budgets, cost controls, and schedules,
    coordination of their work and resolutions of all differences between or among the Contractor and
    Subcontractors. It is expressly understood and agreed that all Subcontractors engaged by Contractor
    hereunder shall at all times be deemed engaged by the Contractor and not by the Trust. The

   Contractor shall cause any Subcontractor employed by the Contractor in connection with the Contract
   to be bound to the terms and conditions of the Contract to the extent such terms and conditions are, or
   may be, applicable to such Subcontractors. All subcontracts held by the Contractor (“Subcontracts”)
   must include the following provisions:

      (a) there is no privity of contract between the Subcontractor and the Trust;
      (b) the Trust will not incur any liability by virtue of any act, omission, negligence, or obligation of
          the Subcontractor or the Contractor;
      (c) the Subcontractor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnitees (defined in
          Article V) against any and all claims, judgments or liabilities to which they may be subject
          (including, without limitation, any and all claims for injuries to persons (including death) and
          damage to property) because of any negligence or any fault or default of the Subcontractor, its
          agents, employees or subcontractors or the breach of the Subcontractor’s obligations under the
          Subcontract;
      (d) the Subcontractor’s payment requisitions shall conform to the same requirements for
          Contractor’s payment requisitions and include the representations and warranties set forth in
          Article III hereof;
      (e) the termination provisions for cause and convenience set forth in Article IV herein shall be
          included in the Subcontract;
      (f) the Subcontract may be assigned without the written consent of the Subcontractor to the Trust
          or any other corporation, agency or instrumentality having authority to accept the assignment;
          and
      (g) all services performed under the Subcontract shall strictly comply with the requirements of the
          Contract.
   If the Contractor fails to include the provisions set forth in this Subsection 5 in any Subcontract, the
   Contractor hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Trust and their representatives
   against any and all claims, damages, awards, judgments, liabilities, expenses, fines, penalties, costs
   and/or fees incurred by or imposed upon the Trust and their representatives, including reasonable
   attorney fees, as a result of said failure.

6. Contractor as Independent Contractor. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Contract, the
   Contractor’s status (and that of any Subcontractor) shall be that of an independent contractor and not
   that of an agent or employee of the Trust. Accordingly, neither the Contractor nor any Subcontractor
   shall hold itself out as, or claim to be acting in the capacity of, an employee or agent of the Trust.

7. Contractor to Obtain Permits. Except as otherwise instructed in writing by the Trust, the
   Contractor shall obtain and comply with all legally required licenses, consents, approvals, orders,
   authorizations, permits, restrictions, declarations and filings required to be obtained by the Trust or
   the Contractor in connection with the Contract.

8. Contractor to Comply with Legal Requirements. The Contractor, in performing its obligations
   and in preparing all documents required under the Contract, shall comply with all applicable laws and
   regulations to be included in the Contract. All applicable laws and regulations shall be deemed to be
   included in the Contract with the same effect as if set forth in full.

9. Increase or Decrease in the Scope of Services. The Trust shall have the right to make changes to,
   and/or increase or decrease the Scope of the Services or to extend the Term at any time and for any
   reason upon notice to Contractor specifying the nature and extent of such changes. In the event any
   such changes result in a reduction of the scope of services, the Maximum Contract Price will be
   correspondingly reduced to reflect the deleted services. In the event any such changes result in an
                                                     31

    additional expenditure of time by the Contractor or Subcontractors, the Trust and the Contractor shall
    negotiate an additional fee for such changes evidenced in an amendment to the Contract.

                                          ARTICLE II
                                      PAYMENT OF SERVICES
1. Payments.
    (a) Subject to, and in accordance with this Article II, the Trust shall pay to the Contractor, and the
        Contractor agrees to accept in full consideration for the Services, and for all expenses of the
        Contractor in connection therewith, including Subcontractors’ costs and reimbursable expenses,
        an amount not to exceed the Maximum Contract Price, payable in accordance with this Article
        II and as provided in Appendix C.
    (b) Requisitions shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Trust and shall be supported by any
        appropriate or necessary documentation or other evidence relating to the amounts set forth in
        the requisition as the Trust may reasonably require including, but not limited to invoices,
        receipts and vouchers from Subcontractors and suppliers, and, where applicable, the time sheets
        and/or certified payroll reports of the Contractor’s staff. Each requisition submitted to the Trust
        by the Contractor shall constitute a representation that, except as specifically set forth in the
        requisition, as of the date of the requisition, all representations and warranties made by the
        Contractor in Article III are true, complete and accurate as if made as of the date of the
        submission of the requisition. Thereafter, the Trust shall approve the requisition if the Services
        have been satisfactorily performed in accordance with the Contract.
    (c) The Contractor, with the Trust’s prior approval, may exceed the maximum payment allocated
        to a particular portion of the Services if the Contractor by notice determines that the maximum
        payment initially allocated to the portion is insufficient to adequately perform the portion of the
        Services and if the Contractor demonstrates to the Trust a savings with respect to another
        portion of the Services which is at least equal to the amount of such excess. However,
        notwithstanding the above, in no event shall the Trust pay the Contractor more than the
        Maximum Contract Price.

2. Acceptance of Final Payment/Release and Discharge. The acceptance by Contractor of the final
   payment under the Contract, or any final payment due on earlier termination of the Contract under
   Article IV, shall constitute a full and complete waiver and release of the Trust from any and all
   claims, demands and causes of action whatsoever that the Contractor, and/or its successors and
   assigns, have, or may have, against the Trust under the provisions of the Contract, unless a detailed
   and verified statement of claim is served upon the Trust not later than fifteen (15) days after the
   making of the final payment. In the absence of a verified statement of claim, if the Contractor
   performs Services that involve maintenance, repairs or minor construction, the Contractor must
   supply the Trust with lien waivers for itself and its Subcontractors along with its request for final
   payment. It is expressly understood and agreed that the Trust’s or Contractor’s termination of the
   Contract pursuant to Article IV hereof shall not give rise to any claims against the Trust for damages,
   compensation, or otherwise as a result of such termination, and that under such circumstances, the
   Trust’s liability to make payments to Contractor on account of any and all Services shall be limited to
   the payments set forth in this Article II and as provided in Appendix C.

                                       ARTICLE III
                             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

1. Representations and Warranties.

            answer any relevant question concerning such transaction or contract; and

     (i)     recognizing that time for completion of the Services is of the essence, the Contractor
             shall perform all of its obligations hereunder in a prompt, efficient and professional

             unreasonably withheld, and the Trust may direct the Contractor to replace assigned
             personnel at any time; the Contractor’s personnel assigned to perform the Services shall
             be available to the Trust during normal working hours and at other times as may be

     (vii)   The Contractor shall not commit its personnel to, nor engage in, any other projects
             during the term of the Contract to the extent that such projects may adversely affect the

                                                                                                     FORM 12/2018




                 quality or efficiency of the Services or would otherwise be detrimental to the conduct
                 and completion of the Services, and the Contractor shall provide sufficient numbers of
                 qualified personnel as shall be required to perform the Services in the time requested by
                 the Trust.

2. Conflict of Interest. Contractor represents and warrants that:

      (a) Contractor has not now, and will not, for a period of one (1) year following expiration of the
          Contract, acquire any interest, direct or indirect, present or prospective, in the project to which
          the Contractor’s work relates or the real estate which is the subject of the project, has not
          employed and will not knowingly employ in connection with work to be performed hereunder
          any person or entity having any such interest during the Term of the Contract.

      (b) Contractor shall not knowingly permit any officer, employee, agent or director of the Trust or
          any of its subsidiaries to share in any benefits that arise from the Contractor’s work.

      (c) Contractor shall not knowingly permit any officer, employee, agent or director of the Trust, or
          any of its subsidiaries to participate in any decision relating to the Contract that affects the
          personal interest of the aforementioned individuals, or the interests of any Trust, partnership, or
          association in which those individuals are directly or indirectly interested; nor shall any officer,
          agent, director or employee of the Trust, or any of its subsidiaries be permitted by the
          Contractor to have any interest, direct or indirect, in the Contract or the proceedings thereof.
          (a)
      (d) Contractor shall cause, for the benefit of the Trust, every contract or agreement with any
          Subcontractor to include the representations contained in subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this

          may direct, or, at Contractor’s option, assign such rights as it may have to the Trust for
          enforcement by the Trust.



                                      ARTICLE IV
                     DELAYS, SUSPENSION OF SERVICES, TERMINATION

1. Notice of Overruns and Delays. The Contractor shall promptly give written notice to the Trust
   representative of the occurrence of an event or action, the discovery of a condition or the failure of an
   event or action to occur or a condition to exist as anticipated, that may result in an increase in (a) the
   compensation due Contractor; (b) reimbursable expenses and/or; (c) the number of hours necessary to
   perform the work or which may delay completion of the work (or extend the completion date). For
   purposes of this provision, “promptly” shall mean as soon as possible but in no event more than (3)
   business days after Contractor’s discovery of the occurrence, condition or failure which gives rise to
   the subject increase and/or delay.

2. Disputes. If at any time the Contractor believes that there is: (1) a condition that will entitle it to
   additional compensation; (2) a change in the schedule for completion of the Services; or (3) another
   issue arising out of terms, conditions, or the respective parties’ fulfillment of their obligations under
   the Contract (“Dispute”), within fifteen (15) days after the Contractor has knowledge, or should have
   known, of the occurrence of a Dispute, the Contractor shall deliver a written notice to the Trust
   stating the general nature of such Dispute. Senior executives of the parties shall negotiate in good
   faith to resolve any Disputes. Pending the resolution of any Dispute, the Contractor shall diligently
                                                     34
                                                                                                    FORM 12/2018




    continue to perform all Services under the Contract, including the Services that are the subject of such
    Dispute. Written notification and good faith negotiation shall be a condition precedent to the
    maintenance of any legal proceeding. The Contractor shall represent that it has complied with the
    condition precedent in its initial notice and pleading in any legal proceeding instituted by the
    Contractor or by the Trust.

3. Suspension of Services. The Trust may, at any time and for any reason and by written notice thereby
   (“Suspension Notice”), direct the Contractor to delay or suspend the services or any part thereof
   under the Contract for a period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days. The Suspension Notice shall
   specify the period during which such services are to be delayed or suspended. The Contract shall
   automatically terminate after ninety (90) days’ suspension or delay unless the Trust and the
   Contractor agree in writing to continue the Contract upon the same or newly negotiated terms, and the
   Trust and the Contractor execute a “Release of Claims” with regards to the period of suspension or
   delay. The Contractor shall resume such services upon the date the Trust may thereafter specify in
   writing upon reasonable notice to Contractor. If the Contract is delayed, suspended or terminated, the
   Contractor shall be entitled upon such delay, suspension or termination to payment of that portion of
   the fee and reimbursable costs that have not been paid to Contractor commensurate with the Services
   actually and satisfactorily performed by the Contractor prior to the date of delay, suspension or
   termination. The Contractor shall not be entitled to any fee during the period of delay or suspension
   unless the Trust, in its sole and absolute discretion, decides that the payment (and amount) of a fee is
   reasonable under the particular circumstances that gave rise to the suspension or delay.

4. Termination for Convenience. The parties acknowledge that the Trust may, at any time for the
   Trust’s convenience and without cause, terminate the Contract without incurring any penalty or
   damages on account of such termination upon seven (7) days’ written notice to the Contractor. In the
   event of such termination, the Trust shall pay the Contractor for services actually and satisfactorily
   performed by Contractor up to the date of such termination plus Trust-approved out-of-pocket
   expenses incurred by the Contractor. The Contractor agrees to cause any agreement or contract
   entered into by the Contractor with any Subcontractors to contain a termination for convenience
   clause consistent with the provisions of this Subsection 4.

5. Default by Contractor. The Trust may terminate the Contract for cause, including:

      (a) a material breach of any covenant or agreement contained in the Contract;
      (b) if the Contractor shall default in the timely performance of any of its obligations under the
          Contract and such default shall continue for a period of three (3) days after written notice from
          the Trust specifying the occurrence, omission or failure giving rise to such default, or if in the
          opinion of the Trust, by reason of the nature of such default, such default cannot be cured
          within such three (3) day period and the Contractor has not promptly prosecuted the curing of
          such default;
      (c) the Contractor shall fail to diligently, timely and expeditiously perform its obligations set forth
          in the Contract;
      (d) any representation or warranty made or deemed to have been made under the Contract by the
          Contractor shall prove to be untrue in any material respect; or
      (e) the Contractor shall make a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or a receiver or
          trustee shall have been appointed on account of Contractor’s insolvency, or Contractor
          otherwise shall be or become insolvent, or an order for relief shall have been entered against
          Contractor under Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.


                                                     35
                                                                                                  FORM 12/2018




    In addition to any other remedies or claims that the Trust may have with respect to such
    representation or such default, the Trust may terminate the Contract immediately upon three (3) days’
    written notice to the Contractor. In the event of such termination, the Trust, without waiving any
    such remedy or claims, (including consequential damages) shall pay the Contractor that portion of the
    fee and reimbursable costs, not paid to the Contractor, commensurate with those Services actually and
    satisfactorily performed by the Contractor up to the date of such termination, provided, however, that
    the Trust shall deduct from any amounts due to the Contractor for additional costs and expenses that
    the Trust may incur in connection with the completion of the Services by another contractor(s) or
    consultant(s).

    The Contractor agrees to cause any agreement or contract entered into by the Contractor with any
    Subcontractors to contain a termination for default clause consistent with the provisions of this
    Subsection 5.

6. Discontinuance of Services Upon Termination. Upon termination of the Contract the Contractor
   shall:

      (a) discontinue all its Services from and after the date of the notice of termination, except as may
          be required to complete any item or portion of services to a point where discontinuance will not
          cause unnecessary waste or duplicative work or cost as directed by the Trust;

      (b) cancel, or if so directed by the Trust, assign to the Trust any and all commitments and
          agreements made by the Contractor relating to the Services to the extent same are cancelable or
          assignable by the Contractor.

      (c) transfer to the Trust in the manner, to the extent, and at the time directed by the Trust, all
          supplies, materials and other property produced (including warranties) as a part of, or acquired
          in, the performance of the Services; and

      (d) take any other actions as the Trust may reasonably direct.

                                        ARTICLE V
                              INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

1. Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Contractor shall be
   responsible for all injuries to persons, including death, or damage to property sustained while
   performing or resulting from the Services under the Contract, if and to the extent the same results
   from any act, omission, negligence, fault or default of Contractor or Subcontractors, or their
   employees, agents, servants, independent contractors or subcontractors retained by Contractor
   pursuant to the Contract. Contractor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the Trust, the State of New
   York, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, the New York State
   Department of Environmental Conservation, the City of New York, the New York City Department
   of Parks and Recreation and each of their respective commissioners, directors, officers, agents and
   employees (collectively the “Indemnitees”) harmless from any and all claims, judgments and
   liabilities, including but not limited to claims, judgments and liabilities for injuries to persons
   (including death) and damage to property if and to the extent the same results from any act, omission,
   negligence, fault or default of Contractor or its Subcontractors, or their agents, employees, servants,
   independent contractors and subcontractors and from any claims against, or liability incurred by the
   Indemnitees by reason of claims against Contractor or its Subcontractors, or their employees, agents,
   servants, independent contractors and subcontractors for any matter whatsoever in connection with
                                                    36
                                                                                                    FORM 12/2018




    the Services performed under the Contract, including, but not limited to, claims for compensation,
    injury or death, and agree to reimburse the Indemnitees for reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in
    connection with the above. Contractor shall be solely responsible for the safety and protection of all
    its Subcontractors, or the employees, agents, servants, independent contractors, or subcontractors of
    Contractor or its Subcontractors, and shall assume all liability for injuries, including death, that may
    occur to said persons due to the negligence, fault or default of Contractor, its Subcontractors, or their
    respective agents, employees, servants, independent contractors or subcontractors.

    This Subsection 1 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Contract.

2. Insurance. At all times during the performance of the Services or for such other time periods as the
   Trust may require, the Contractor, at its sole cost and expense, shall purchase and maintain the
   insurance described in Appendix D unless the Trust determines, in its sole and absolute discretion,
   that such insurance limits warrant a reduction due to a material change in the Project or the Services.

                                     ARTICLE VI
                       DOCUMENTS, CONFIDENTIALITY AND RECORDS

1. Ownership of Documents.

      (a) All originals, negatives, and electronic copies of all plans, drawings, reports, photograph,
          charts, programs, models, specimens, specifications, and other documents or materials required
          to be furnished by the Contractor under the Contract including drafts and reproduction copies
          thereof (“Documents”), shall be and remain the exclusive property of the Trust, and the Trust
          shall have the right to publish, transfer, sell, license and use all or any part of such reports,
          plans, drawings, specification and other documents without payment of any additional royalty,
          charge or other compensation to the Contractor. If the Documents are altered by the Trust or its
          agents, the Trust holds the Contractor harmless from any liability for such use.

      (b) The Contractor agrees that it shall not publish, transfer, license or, except in connection with
          carrying out its obligations under the Contract, use or reuse all or any part of the Documents,
          excluding the Contractor’s “Underlying Intellectual Property” (as defined hereinafter),
          without the prior written approval of the Trust, except that the Contractor may retain copies of
          such reports and other documents for general reference use.

      (c) The Contractor’s Underlying Intellectual Property means the analytical concepts, approaches,
          methodologies, or formats developed by the Contractor’s staff, and other materials not prepared
          for delivery to the Trust and also includes any derivatives, improvements, enhancements or
          extensions of the Contractor’s Underlying Intellectual Property conceived, reduced to practice,
          or developed during the Term of the Contract that are not uniquely applicable to the Documents
          prepared for the Trust under the Contract.

      (d) The Contractor represents and warrants that, except for material which is in the public domain
          and non-original material, the Documents:

           (i) shall be wholly original material not published elsewhere;
           (ii) shall not violate any copyright, trademark or other applicable law; and
           (iii) shall not, to the best of Contractor’s knowledge, constitute a defamation or invasion of
                 the right of privacy or publicity, or an infringement of any kind, of any rights of any
                 third party.
                                                     37
                                                                                                  FORM 12/2018




      (e) The Contractor shall not make any unauthorized use of copyrighted, trademarked or other
          protected materials or intellectual property and agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
          the Trust and their respective officers, officials, agents, members, directors, and employees
          against any damage or liability arising out of the Contractor’s infringement or unauthorized use
          of any such material or property.

2. Confidentiality. The Contractor hereby agrees that all documents, data, recommendations, reports
   and other materials developed in the course of the Services authorized by the Contract are strictly
   confidential between the Contractor and the Trust and the Contractor may not at any time reveal or
   disclose such materials in whole or in part to any third party without first obtaining written
   permission from the Trust. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Contractor shall cooperate
   fully with such third parties as the Trust may designate by written request.

3. Maintenance, Audit and Examination of Records. Pursuant to Section 10 of the Standard Clauses
   for NYS Contracts (attached hereto as Appendix A), the Contractor and its Subcontractors must
   maintain their respective books and records for examination and audit as specifically detailed therein.
   In the event of non-compliance thereof, the Trust shall not pay the Contractor any portion of the fee
   then due or becoming due, as the case may be, with respect to such non-compliance, and if such fee
   has already been paid, the Trust may require the Contractor to refund such fee. In addition, the
   Contractor shall be responsible for any audit costs incurred by the Trust as a result of such non-
   compliance.


                                         ARTICLE VII
                                 OTHER STANDARD PROVISIONS

1. No Waiver. Failure by the Trust to insist upon the strict performance of any term or condition of the
   Contract or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof, and no acceptance of
   full or partial performance during the continuance of any such breach shall constitute a waiver of any
   such breach or such term or condition. No term or condition of the Contract to be performed or
   complied with by Contractor, and no breach thereof, shall be waived, altered or modified except by a
   written instrument executed by the Trust. No waiver of any breach shall affect or alter the Contract,
   but each and every term and condition of the Contract shall continue in full force and effect with
   respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach thereof. Contractor hereby waives any and all
   rights and remedies to which Contractor might otherwise be or become entitled to because of any
   wrongful act or omission of the Trust saving only Contractor’s right to money damages.

2. Provisions Required by Law Deemed Inserted. Each and every provision of law and governmental
   regulation required by law to be inserted in the Contract shall be deemed to be inserted therein and
   the Contract shall read and enforced as though so included therein, and if through mistake or
   otherwise any such provision is not inserted, or is not correctly inserted, then upon the application of
   either party, the Contract shall be deemed to be amended to make such insertion or correction. If the
   Contract contains any unlawful provision, the same shall be deemed of no effect and shall, upon the
   application of either party, be deemed stricken from the Contract without affecting the binding force
   of the remainder.

   transfer and assignment shall relieve the Trust of any further liability or obligation hereunder.

   shall be binding unless evidenced in a writing signed by both parties.

8. Severability. If any term or provision of the Contract or the application thereof to any person or in
   any circumstance shall to any extent be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
   provisions of the Contract, or the application of such terms or provisions to persons or circumstances
   other than those as to which it is found to be invalid or unenforceable, shall in no way be affected
   thereby, and each term and provision of the Contract shall be valid and binding upon the parties, and
   enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

9. Counterparts and Captions. The Contract may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of

                                STANDARD CLAUSES FOR NYS CONTRACTS

The parties to the attached contract, license, lease, amendment or other agreement of any kind (hereinafter, "the
contract" or "this contract") agree to be bound by the following clauses which are hereby made a part of the contract
(the word "Contractor" herein refers to any party other than the State, whether a contractor, licenser, licensee, lessor,
lessee or any other party):

1. EXECUTORY CLAUSE. In accordance with Section 41 of the State Finance Law, the State shall have no liability
under this contract to the Contractor or to anyone else beyond funds appropriated and available for this contract.

2. NON-ASSIGNMENT CLAUSE. In accordance with Section 138 of the State Finance Law, this contract may not
be assigned by the Contractor or its right, title or interest therein assigned, transferred, conveyed, sublet or otherwise
disposed of without the State’s previous written consent, and attempts to do so are null and void. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such prior written consent of an assignment of a contract let pursuant to Article XI of the State Finance
Law may be waived at the discretion of the contracting agency and with the concurrence of the State Comptroller
where the original contract was subject to the State Comptroller’s approval, where the assignment is due to a
reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Contractor’s business entity or enterprise. The State retains its right to
approve an assignment and to require that any Contractor demonstrate its responsibility to do business with the State.
The Contractor may, however, assign its right to receive payments without the State’s prior written consent unless this
contract concerns Certificates of Participation pursuant to Article 5-A of the State Finance Law.

3. COMPTROLLER'S APPROVAL. In accordance with Section 112 of the State Finance Law (or, if this contract
is with the State University or City University of New York, Section 355 or Section 6218 of the Education Law), if
this contract exceeds $50,000 (or the minimum thresholds agreed to by the Office of the State Comptroller for certain
S.U.N.Y. and C.U.N.Y. contracts), or if this is an amendment for any amount to a contract which, as so amended,
exceeds said statutory amount, or if, by this contract, the State agrees to give something other than money when the
value or reasonably estimated value of such consideration exceeds $10,000, it shall not be valid, effective or binding
upon the State until it has been approved by the State Comptroller and filed in his office. Comptroller's approval of
contracts let by the Office of General Services is required when such contracts exceed $85,000 (State Finance Law
Section 163.6-a). However, such pre-approval shall not be required for any contract established as a centralized
contract through the Office of General Services or for a purchase order or other transaction issued under such
centralized contract.

4. WORKERS' COMPENSATION BENEFITS. In accordance with Section 142 of the State Finance Law, this
contract shall be void and of no force and effect unless the Contractor shall provide and maintain coverage during the
life of this contract for the benefit of such employees as are required to be covered by the provisions of the Workers'
Compensation Law.

5. NON-DISCRIMINATION REQUIREMENTS. To the extent required by Article 15 of the Executive Law (also
known as the Human Rights Law) and all other State and Federal statutory and constitutional non-discrimination
provisions, the Contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race,
creed, color, sex (including gender identity or expression), national origin, sexual orientation, military status, age,
disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, marital status or domestic violence victim status. Furthermore, in
accordance with Section 220-e of the Labor Law, if this is a contract for the construction, alteration or repair of any
public building or public work or for the manufacture, sale or distribution of materials, equipment or supplies, and to
the extent that this contract shall be performed within the State of New York, Contractor agrees that neither it nor its
subcontractors shall, by reason of race, creed, color, disability, sex, or national origin: (a) discriminate in hiring
against any New York State citizen who is qualified and available to perform the work; or (b) discriminate against or
intimidate any employee hired for the performance of work under this contract. If this is a building service contract
as defined in Section 230 of the Labor Law, then, in accordance with Section 239 thereof, Contractor agrees that
neither it nor its subcontractors shall by reason of race, creed, color, national origin, age, sex or disability: (a)
discriminate in hiring against any New York State citizen who is qualified and available to perform the work; or (b)
discriminate against or intimidate any employee hired for the performance of work under this contract. Contractor is
subject to fines of $50.00 per person per day for any violation of Section 220-e or Section

                                                           43
                                                                                                                 FORM 12/2018




239 as well as possible termination of this contract and forfeiture of all moneys due hereunder for a second or
subsequent violation.

6. WAGE AND HOURS PROVISIONS. If this is a public work contract covered by Article 8 of the Labor Law or
a building service contract covered by Article 9 thereof, neither Contractor's employees nor the employees of its
subcontractors may be required or permitted to work more than the number of hours or days stated in said statutes,
except as otherwise provided in the Labor Law and as set forth in prevailing wage and supplement schedules issued
by the State Labor Department. Furthermore, Contractor and its subcontractors must pay at least the prevailing wage
rate and pay or provide the prevailing supplements, including the premium rates for overtime pay, as determined by
the State Labor Department in accordance with the Labor Law. Additionally, effective April 28, 2008, if this is a
public work contract covered by Article 8 of the Labor Law, the Contractor understands and agrees that the filing of
payrolls in a manner consistent with Subdivision 3-a of Section 220 of the Labor Law shall be a condition precedent
to payment by the State of any State approved sums due and owing for work done upon the project.

7. NON-COLLUSIVE BIDDING CERTIFICATION. In accordance with Section 139-d of the State Finance Law,
if this contract was awarded based upon the submission of bids, Contractor affirms, under penalty of perjury, that its
bid was arrived at independently and without collusion aimed at restricting competition. Contractor further affirms
that, at the time Contractor submitted its bid, an authorized and responsible person executed and delivered to the State
a non-collusive bidding certification on Contractor's behalf.

8. INTERNATIONAL BOYCOTT PROHIBITION. In accordance with Section 220-f of the Labor Law and
Section 139-h of the State Finance Law, if this contract exceeds $5,000, the Contractor agrees, as a material condition
of the contract, that neither the Contractor nor any substantially owned or affiliated person, firm, partnership or Trust
has participated, is participating, or shall participate in an international boycott in violation of the federal Export
Administration Act of 1979 (50 USC App. Sections 2401 et seq.) or regulations thereunder. If such Contractor, or
any of the aforesaid affiliates of Contractor, is convicted or is otherwise found to have violated said laws or regulations
upon the final determination of the United States Commerce Department or any other appropriate agency of the United
States subsequent to the contract's execution, such contract, amendment or modification thereto shall be rendered
forfeit and void. The Contractor shall so notify the State Comptroller within five (5) business days of such conviction,
determination or disposition of appeal (2NYCRR 105.4).

9. SET-OFF RIGHTS. The State shall have all of its common law, equitable and statutory rights of set-off. These
rights shall include, but not be limited to, the State's option to withhold for the purposes of set-off any moneys due to
the Contractor under this contract up to any amounts due and owing to the State with regard to this contract, any other
contract with any State department or agency, including any contract for a term commencing prior to the term of this
contract, plus any amounts due and owing to the State for any other reason including, without limitation, tax
delinquencies, fee delinquencies or monetary penalties relative thereto. The State shall exercise its set-off rights in
accordance with normal State practices including, in cases of set-off pursuant to an audit, the finalization of such audit
by the State agency, its representatives, or the State Comptroller.

10. RECORDS. The Contractor shall establish and maintain complete and accurate books, records, documents,
accounts and other evidence directly pertinent to performance under this contract (hereinafter, collectively, "the
Records"). The Records must be kept for the balance of the calendar year in which they were made and for six (6)
additional years thereafter. The State Comptroller, the Attorney General and any other person or entity authorized to
conduct an examination, as well as the agency or agencies involved in this contract, shall have access to the Records
during normal business hours at an office of the Contractor within the State of New York or, if no such office is
available, at a mutually agreeable and reasonable venue within the State, for the term specified above for the purposes
of inspection, auditing and copying. The State shall take reasonable steps to protect from public disclosure any of the
Records which are exempt from disclosure under Section 87 of the Public Officers Law (the "Statute") provided that:
(i) the Contractor shall timely inform an appropriate State official, in writing, that said records should not be disclosed;
and (ii) said records shall be sufficiently identified; and (iii) designation of said records as exempt under the Statute
is reasonable. Nothing contained herein shall diminish, or in any way adversely affect, the State's right to discovery
in any pending or future litigation.

                                                                                                                 FORM 12/2018




11. IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AND PRIVACY NOTIFICATION. (a) Identification Number(s). Every
invoice or New York State Claim for Payment submitted to a New York State agency by a payee, for payment for the
sale of goods or services or for transactions (e.g., leases, easements, licenses, etc.) related to real or personal property
must include the payee's identification number. The number is any or all of the following: (i) the payee’s Federal
employer identification number, (ii) the payee’s Federal social security number, and/or (iii) the payee’s Vendor
Identification Number assigned by the Statewide Financial System. Failure to include such number or numbers may
delay payment. Where the payee does not have such number or numbers, the payee, on its invoice or Claim for
Payment, must give the reason or reasons why the payee does not have such number or numbers.

(b) Privacy Notification. (1) The authority to request the above personal information from a seller of goods or services
or a lessor of real or personal property, and the authority to maintain such information, is found in Section 5 of the
State Tax Law. Disclosure of this information by the seller or lessor to the State is mandatory. The principal purpose
for which the information is collected is to enable the State to identify individuals, businesses and others who have
been delinquent in filing tax returns or may have understated their tax liabilities and to generally identify persons
affected by the taxes administered by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance. The information will be used for
tax administration purposes and for any other purpose authorized by law. (2) The personal information is requested
by the purchasing unit of the agency contracting to purchase the goods or services or lease the real or personal property
covered by this contract or lease. The information is maintained in the Statewide Financial System by the Vendor
Management Unit within the Bureau of State Expenditures, Office of the State Comptroller, 110 State Street, Albany,
New York 12236.

12. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MINORITIES AND WOMEN. In accordance with
Section 312 of the Executive Law and 5 NYCRR 143, if this contract is: (i) a written agreement or purchase order
instrument, providing for a total expenditure in excess of $25,000.00, whereby a contracting agency is committed to
expend or does expend funds in return for labor, services, supplies, equipment, materials or any combination of the
foregoing, to be performed for, or rendered or furnished to the contracting agency; or (ii) a written agreement in excess
of $100,000.00 whereby a contracting agency is committed to expend or does expend funds for the acquisition,
construction, demolition, replacement, major repair or renovation of real property and improvements thereon; or (iii)
a written agreement in excess of $100,000.00 whereby the owner of a State assisted housing project is committed to
expend or does expend funds for the acquisition, construction, demolition, replacement, major repair or renovation of
real property and improvements thereon for such project, then the following shall apply and by signing this agreement
the Contractor certifies and affirms that it is Contractor’s equal employment opportunity policy that:

(a) The Contractor will not discriminate against employees or applicants for employment because of race, creed,
color, national origin, sex, age, disability or marital status, shall make and document its conscientious and active
efforts to employ and utilize minority group members and women in its work force on State contracts and will
undertake or continue existing programs of affirmative action to ensure that minority group members and women are
afforded equal employment opportunities without discrimination. Affirmative action shall mean recruitment,
employment, job assignment, promotion, upgradings, demotion, transfer, layoff, or termination and rates of pay or
other forms of compensation;

(b) at the request of the contracting agency, the Contractor shall request each employment agency, labor union, or
authorized representative of workers with which it has a collective bargaining or other agreement or understanding,
to furnish a written statement that such employment agency, labor union or representative will not discriminate on the
basis of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, disability or marital status and that such union or representative
will affirmatively cooperate in the implementation of the Contractor's obligations herein; and

(c) the Contractor shall state, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees, that, in the performance of the State
contract, all qualified applicants will be afforded equal employment opportunities without discrimination because of
race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, disability or marital status.

Contractor will include the provisions of "a", "b", and "c" above, in every subcontract over $25,000.00 for the
construction, demolition, replacement, major repair, renovation, planning or design of real property and improvements
thereon (the "Work") except where the Work is for the beneficial use of the Contractor. Section 312 does not apply
to: (i) work, goods or services unrelated to this contract; or (ii) employment outside New York State. The State shall
                                                            45
                                                                                                              FORM 12/2018




consider compliance by a contractor or subcontractor with the requirements of any federal law concerning equal
employment opportunity which effectuates the purpose of this section. The contracting agency shall determine
whether the imposition of the requirements of the provisions hereof duplicate or conflict with any such federal law
and if such duplication or conflict exists, the contracting agency shall waive the applicability of Section 312 to the
extent of such duplication or conflict. Contractor will comply with all duly promulgated and lawful rules and
regulations of the Department of Economic Development’s Division of Minority and Women's Business Development
pertaining hereto.

13. CONFLICTING TERMS. In the event of a conflict between the terms of the contract (including any and all
attachments thereto and amendments thereof) and the terms of this Appendix A, the terms of this Appendix A shall
control.

14. GOVERNING LAW. This contract shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York except where the
Federal supremacy clause requires otherwise.

15. LATE PAYMENT. Timeliness of payment and any interest to be paid to Contractor for late payment shall be
governed by Article 11-A of the State Finance Law to the extent required by law.

16. NO ARBITRATION. Disputes involving this contract, including the breach or alleged breach thereof, may not
be submitted to binding arbitration (except where statutorily authorized), but must, instead, be heard in a court of
competent jurisdiction of the State of New York.

17. SERVICE OF PROCESS. In addition to the methods of service allowed by the State Civil Practice Law & Rules
("CPLR"), Contractor hereby consents to service of process upon it by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested. Service hereunder shall be complete upon Contractor's actual receipt of process or upon the State's receipt
of the return thereof by the United States Postal Service as refused or undeliverable. Contractor must promptly notify
the State, in writing, of each and every change of address to which service of process can be made. Service by the
State to the last known address shall be sufficient. Contractor will have thirty (30) calendar days after service
hereunder is complete in which to respond.

18. PROHIBITION ON PURCHASE OF TROPICAL HARDWOODS. The Contractor certifies and warrants that
all wood products to be used under this contract award will be in accordance with, but not limited to, the specifications
and provisions of Section 165 of the State Finance Law, (Use of Tropical Hardwoods) which prohibits purchase and
use of tropical hardwoods, unless specifically exempted, by the State or any governmental agency or political
