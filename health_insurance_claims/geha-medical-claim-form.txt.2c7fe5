      4. Submitting the Claim Form
        In-network medical claims: When you use a health care provider that is in GEHA's network,
        you will not have to fill out any claim forms in most cases. GEHA's in-network providers and
        facilities file claims for you as indicated on your ID card.
        Out-of-network medical claims: If you use an out-of-network provider, the claim may be
        submitted by either you or by the provider. Federal regulations require that a claim submitted
        by a provider must be filed on a CMS-1500 form. If you need to submit a medical claim yourself
        and you have an itemized bill, please attach and mail to PO Box 21542, Eagan, MN 55121. If
        you need assistance with completing this form, please contact GEHA at (800) 821-6136.
