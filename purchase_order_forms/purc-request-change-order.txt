REQUEST FOR CHANGE ORDER POLICY AND APPROVAL INSTRUCTIONS (page 2)

IIT Change Order Policy:

      •     Change orders are communicated to Purchasing via a written change order form which
            specifies the nature of the change and provides the requisitioning department’s approval
            for the change.
      •     Change orders require approval at the level appropriate to the revised total amount of
            the purchase order after the change order has been applied.
      •     Changes to purchase orders involving grant funds also require approval by Grant and
            Contract Accounting.
      •     All approval signatures are required on a written change order form before the change
            order is processed by the Purchasing Department.
      •      Exceptions to this approval process are change orders that:
                 o result in a decreased cost of the order
                 o provide additional description without increasing the cost of the order
                 o are required to change the accounts charged
                 o cancel or complete purchase orders
                 o and /or reflect revisions to construction contracts which are subject to contract
                     specific language pertaining to the change order process.


Regarding Approval Signatures:

The Change Order must be signed by an approver who is authorized at or above the dollar
limit resulting after the change order.

(For the following example, assume that the requisitioner has approval authority up to $25,000.)

Example: An initial purchase of $20,000 later needs to be increased by change order to a new
total of $26,000.

Before the change order: The resulting purchase order amounted to $20,000 and was within the
approval limits of the requisitioner so no additional approval was required.

Later, a change order is required to cover additional costs of $6,000.

A change order is requested to raise the total purchase order, which will now amount to $26,000

The change order MUST be signed by an approver who has the authority to approve requisitions
at the $26,000 level or higher.

If the change is related to a grant funded purchase order, it must also be reviewed and
approved by Grant and Contract Accounting.

NOTE: The Banner System allows invoicing to be processed without a change order if the
invoiced amounts do not exceed 20% of the purchase order amount or $500, whichever is
less. No Request for Change Order is required if invoice pricing falls within these
tolerances.
