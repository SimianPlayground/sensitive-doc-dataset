I affirm that:
• I have not already been paid for these expenses from my FSA and I have not requested and will not receive reimbursement for
   these expenses from any other plan including FEDVIP (Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program) and FEHB (Federal Employees
   Health Benefits Program); and
• I have submitted the above information in good faith and it is correct to the best of my knowledge.
I understand that:
• Reimbursement is not a guarantee that this payment is tax-free.
• The service(s) for which I am requesting reimbursement must be incurred during my period of coverage, which begins the next January 1 if I enrolled
   during the Open Season, or the day after my enrollment is accepted by FSAFEDS, whichever is later, and ends no later than March 15 of the following
   year, unless my coverage ends sooner due to a Qualifying Life Event.
• I have until April 30 to submit my claim for reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred during my period of coverage. If I do
   not submit claims for reimbursement by that date, I will forfeit any funds remaining in my account(s) in accordance with IRS rules.
• Health care expenses reimbursed through my general purpose HCFSA or LEX HCFSA cannot be used as a deduction on my personal income tax return.
I authorize release of payment through my Flexible Spending Account. I authorize FSAFEDS, or its representatives, to obtain necessary information from
 all physicians, hospitals, medical service providers, pharmacists, employers, and all other agencies or organizations (including other insurers) to consider
 the claim for reimbursement under my Flexible Spending Account.
