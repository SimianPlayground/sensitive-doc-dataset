       I hereby certify that all information herein are true and correct based on my own personal knowledge. I authorize the Bank to obtain information as
it may require concerning my loan application and agree that it shall remain the Bank’s property whether my loan is approved or not. Any information
given by me or other persons duly authorized by me which is not true or accurate, will automatically cause the Bank to reject my loan, cancel its approval
or if the loan has been released to me, to demand immediate payment thereof.
      I hereby willingly, voluntarily and with full knowledge of my right under the law, waive the right to confidentiality of information and authorize the
Bank to disclose, divulge and reveal any such information relating to the loan application or account, including events of default, for the purpose of,
among others, client evaluation, credit reporting or verification, and recovery of the loan due and payable to the Bank under the terms and conditions of
this application.
     For this purpose, I hereby authorize the Bank, its employees or its agent to verify and obtain information relevant to my loan application, such as,
but not limited to residential and contact information, business or trade, employment and payment performance.
     In view of the foregoing, the Bank may disclose, divulge and reveal the aforementioned information to third parties, including but not limited to my
employer, the Bank’s affiliates, subsidiaries, agents or services providers, the Bankers’ Association of the Philippines – Credit Bureau (BAP – CB) or to
any similar central monitoring entity or recipients as provided for by law and required by competent authority.
     I further authorize the Bank, as my Attorney-in-Fact, to conduct random verification with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (the "BIR") in order to
establish the authenticity of my tax statements (the "ITR”) and the accompanying financial statements/documents submitted to the BANK in accordance
with banking regulatory requirements.
     I hold the Bank free and harmless from any and all liabilities, claims and demands of whatever kind or nature in connection with or arising from the
aforementioned disclosure or reporting.
     I hereby acknowledge that the Personal Loan or any part(s) thereof shall be deemed to have been availed on the date on which funds are
transferred to my bank account or cash/prepaid card, maintained with the Bank, or receipt of the Manager’s Check reflecting the amount of the loan less
applicable fees, charges and taxes.
     I further authorize the Bank to deduct from the proceeds of my loan, all fees including, but not limited to, processing fees, documentary stamp tax,
notarial fees and interest accruals should the first due date be over 30 days from the release of my loan and other related charges.
      I likewise authorize the Bank to provide me with a consumer loan or additional bank product/s (such as but not limited to auto, housing, credit card
and other products suited to my situation) at the Bank’s sole discretion. My acceptance of the credit card or the proceeds of any loan released pursuant
thereto shall be conclusive proof of my acknowledgement of my additional obligations and/or indebtedness to the Bank under the Terms and Conditions
set forth by the Bank and prevailing at the time the credit card is issued or the additional loan is approved.
     I hereby agree that the Bank has the right to approve a lower amount than my desired loan amount as indicated in this application and shall render
the Bank free and harmless from any liability arising thereof.
     I hereby agree that should my application be denied, the Bank has no obligation to furnish the reason for such rejection or to return my application
and other submitted documents.
      I also legally bind myself to the Terms and Conditions of the Loan Program Promissory Note, Disclosure Statement and other relevant documents
that I shall execute in favor of the Bank.
