                                    HIPAA INFORMATION AND CONSENT FORM

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) provides safeguards to protect your privacy as a
patient. Implementation of HIPAA requirements officially began on April 14, 2003. While we have followed these
policies for years, there have been a few updates that we wanted you to be aware of. This is a shortened version
of the HIPPA policy. The full policy is available for your review in the reception area.

There are rules and restrictions on who may see or be notified of your Protected Health Information (PHI). These
restrictions do not include the normal exchange of information within our office, HIPAA provides certain rights and
protections to you as the patient. We follow these guidelines and provide you with the quality care you deserve.
Additional information is available from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services. You can find them
online at www.hhs.gov.

This summarizes our office policy here at Victor Immel, DMD, PS.

Patient information will be kept confidential except when it is necessary to provide services or to ensure that all
administrative matters related to your care are handled properly. This may include, but not limited to, the sharing
of information with other healthcare providers, laboratories, and health insurance companies. Patient information
(treatment plans, insurance forms, eob’s, etc.) may be stored in file cabinets not accessible by patients.
Preparing for and during your dental visit such records may be left, at least temporarily, in administrative areas
such as the front office, doctor’s desk, examination room, etc. Those records will not be available to persons
other than office staff. You agree to the normal procedures utilized within the office for the handling of charts,
patient records, PHI and other documents or information.

We send out reminders to our patients. We do this by one or more of the following: e-mail, texting, calling, and
sending postcards. We try to make every effort to remind you of your appointment and any treatment that you
may need. We may send you other communications informing you of changes to office policy and new technology
that you might find valuable or informative. We also may send out newsletters or special promotions that we are
offering.

You agree to us sending electronic referrals to specialists, which include your PHI and x-rays, if needed. We also
send electronic claims to your dental insurance, which includes submitting PHI to receive payment for services
provided.

You give us permission to remind you to take pre-medication prior to appointments, if applicable.

You give us permission to call in any prescriptions you may need and share your PHI with the pharmacist.

The practice utilizes a number of vendors in the conduct of business. These vendors may have access to PHI but
must agree to abide by the confidentiality rules of HIPAA.

You understand and agree to inspections of the office and review of documents which may include PHI by
government agencies or insurance payers in normal performance of their duties.

You agree to bring any concerns or complaints regarding privacy to the attention of the office manager or the
doctor, and understand that you have the right to file a complaint. We can help you do this, and you will not be
penalized for filing a complaint.

Your confidential information will not be used for the purposes of marketing or advertising of products, goods or
services without your permission.

We agree to provide patients with access to their records in accordance with state and federal laws. We may
update this policy as needed to better serve the needs of our patients and our practice.



By signing below, I agree that, I have been offered the HIPAA policy, and understand and acknowledge my
agreement to the terms set forth in the HIPAA information and consent form and any future updates to this policy.
