               INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONTRACT STAFFING SERVICES

The NWSA / Port of Tacoma is soliciting proposals from firms interested in providing Information
Technology Contract Staffing Services on an as-needed basis.

A. BACKGROUND
The NWSA is an operating partnership of the ports of Seattle and Tacoma. Combined, the ports are
the fourth-largest container gateway in North America. Regional marine cargo facilities also are a major
center for bulk, breakbulk, project/heavy-lift cargoes, automobiles, and trucks.
The NWSA is governed by the two ports as equal Managing Members, with each Managing Member
consisting of the five commissioners in each port. Each port’s commissioners are elected at large by
the citizens of their respective counties. To learn more about the NWSA visit
www.nwseaportalliance.com. To learn more about the Port of Tacoma visit www.portoftacoma.com.
The Port maintains several enterprise software applications and terminal operating systems, including
IBM Maximo Asset Management, Microsoft Dynamics GP, Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM, Microsoft
SharePoint, Microsoft PowerBI, Kronos TeleStaff, ADP eTime, PDS Vista HRMS, PsiGen PsiSAFE,
Esri ArcGIS, Prophix (CPM), Yardi Systems property management, Trimble e-Builder, Argonaut
Systems Bellerophon, Tideworks iPro and other systems. Some systems are SaaS/cloud services and
others are hosted by the Port in a hybrid cloud (Azure) and on-premises infrastructure.
The Port has an in-house Information Technology department with project management, infrastructure,
support, technical, functional, and business process staff. On occasion, the Information Technology
department requires additional human resources to supplement regular staff during peak workloads, to
cover extended absences, or to provide specialized skillsets.
The technical resources anticipated to be required are listed below. Experience levels for each resource
required will vary from Junior to Senior depending upon the specific engagement. Specific skills and
experience needed will also vary depending up the specific engagement:
      Project Manager
      Business Analyst
      Software Engineer
      Network Infrastructure Engineer
      Systems Infrastructure Engineer
      Database Analyst
      IT Support Specialist (helpdesk)
      Other IT Positions
We anticipate needing to utilize 3-4 contract resources per year with a duration from 3-11 months each.
In the past 12 months we have filled 3 contract staffing positions using our currently contracted vendors.
There are four staffing firms that were selected by the previous procurement which will be expiring and
will be replaced by firms selected using this new procurement.


Attachment A to the RFP contains the Instructions and Information for proposing to the solicitation.


Request for Proposals
Information Technology Contract Staffing Services
B. SCOPE OF SERVICES:
Through this RFP the Port may award up to five (5) IT Contract Staffing contracts to those firms (“firms”),
who agree to Port Terms and Conditions (Attachment D, Sample Contract), through which Port
Information Technology Contract Staffing requirements will be sourced. The duration of this
arrangement is expected to be three (3) years with the option, at the Port’s discretion, to renew for an
additional two (2) years for a total of five (5) years.
When the Port identifies a need for an Information Technology Contracting Resource a summary of the
requirements will be sent to all selected staffing firms using a Project Service Order (PSO) form. The
requirements will include a description of the engagement, skillset required, experience level required,
expected duration, and any other pertinent information. Attachment B includes sample PSO forms to
illustrate typical positions. These are examples only. Please do NOT include resumes for candidates
with your submitted proposal for this RFP.
Within five (5) days of receipt of a PSO form for a staffing opportunity, selected firms will complete the
Contractor section of the PSO form and submit it along with resumes of available, qualified, contract
resources. The Port will review submitted resumes, and schedule interviews with shortlisted
candidates. The Port will select the candidate who best fits the Port’s requirements, which will generally
consist of a combination of experience, value, and cultural fit. If no sufficiently qualified candidates are
received from the selected firms, the Port may then open the staffing opportunity to other firms.
Purchase Orders will be issued for individual Contract Staffing engagements.
C. DELIVERABLES:
Deliverables will vary based on the PSO.

    purchase or use of the Contractor’s product or services performed pursuant to this Contract shall be

24. Proprietary and Confidential Information
    A. Contractor understands that any records (including but not limited to bid or proposal submittals, the
    Agreement, and any other contract materials) it submits to the Port , or that are used by the Port
    even if the Contractor possesses the records, are public records under Washington State law, RCW
    Chapter 42.56. Public records must be promptly disclosed upon request unless a statute exempts them
    from disclosure. The Contractor also understands that even if part of a record is exempt from disclosure,
    the rest of that record generally must be disclosed.

    B. If the Port receives a public disclosure request made pursuant to RCW 42.56, the Port will not assert
    an exemption from disclosure on behalf of the Contractor. For materials that the Contractor has properly
    marked, the Port may notify the Contractor of the request and postpone disclosure for ten business
    days to allow the Contractor to file a lawsuit seeking an injunction preventing the release of documents
    pursuant to RCW 42.56.540. Providing any notification is a courtesy and is not an obligation on behalf
    of the Port. Unless the Contractor obtains and serves an injunction upon the Port before the close of
    business on the tenth business day after the date of the notification, the Port may release the
    documents. It is the Contractor’s discretionary decision whether to file the lawsuit.

    C. If the Contractor does not obtain and serve an injunction upon the Port within 10 business days of
    the date of the Port’s notification of the request, the Contractor is deemed to have authorized releasing
    the record.

    D. The Contractor will fully cooperate with the Port in identifying and assembling records in case of any

    separate from this Contract or was preexisting material (not already owned by The Port), provided that
    the Contractor has clearly identified in writing such material as preexisting prior to commencement of
    the Work. To the extent that preexisting materials are incorporated into the Work, the Contractor grants
    The Port an irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully paid, royalty-free right and/or license to use, execute,
    reproduce, display, and transfer the preexisting material, but only as an inseparable part of the Work.

    Intergovernmental Cooperative Purchasing Agreement with the Port of Tacoma, those agencies are
    eligible to purchase from Contracts established by the Port. Such agencies may ask Port of Tacoma
    Contractors to accept orders from the agency, citing the Port of Tacoma contract as the basis for the
    order. The Contractor may accept or decline such orders. If the Contractor accepts an order from
    another public agency using the Port of Tacoma contract as the basis, the Contractor agrees to sell
    additional items at the contract prices, terms, and conditions. The Port of Tacoma accepts no
    responsibility for the payment of the purchase price by other governmental agencies.
39. Expansion
    Expansion of any resultant contract or Purchase Order may occur as allowed below. A modification
    may be considered per the criteria and procedures below, for any ongoing unexpired Contract.
    Likewise, a one-time Purchase Order may be modified if the bid reserved the right for additional orders
    to be placed within a specified period of time, or if the project or body of work associated with a
    Purchase Order is still active. Modifications must be mutually agreed to. The only person authorized to
    make such agreements on behalf of the Port is the Contract Administrator. No other Port employee is
    authorized to make such written notices. Expansions must be issued in writing from Contract
    Administrator in a formal notice. The Contract Administrator will ensure the expansion meets the
    following criteria:
    (a) It could not be separately bid,
    (b) The change is for a reasonable purpose,
    (c) The change was not reasonably known to either the Port or Contractors at time of bid or else was
    mentioned as a possibility in the bid (such as a change in environmental regulation or other law);
    (d) The change is not significant enough to be reasonably regarded as an independent body of work;
    (e) The change could not have attracted a different field of competition; and
    (f) The change does not vary the essential identity or main purpose of the contract.

    The Contract Administrator shall make this determination, and may make exceptions for immaterial
    changes, emergency or sole source conditions, or for other situations as required.

    Note: changes, which are not considered an expansion of scope, including an increase in quantities
    ordered the exercise of options and alternates in the bid, or ordering of work originally identified within
    the originating solicitation. If such changes are approved, changes are conducted as a written order
    issued by Contract Administrator to the Contractor.

40. Disputes
    If a dispute arises relating to this Agreement and cannot be settled through direct discussions, the
    parties agree to endeavor to settle the dispute through a mediation firm acceptable to both parties, the
    cost of which shall be divided equally. The Port reserves the right to join any dispute under this
    Agreement with any other claim in litigation or other dispute resolution forum, and the Contractor agrees
    to such joinder, so that all disputes related to the project may be consolidated and resolved in one
    forum. Venue for any litigation shall be the Pierce County Superior Court of the state of Washington
    and the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

41. Termination

        A. For Cause: The Port may terminate this Contract if the Contractor is in material breach of any
           of the terms of this Contract, and such breach has not been corrected to The Port ’s reasonable
           satisfaction in a timely manner.

        B. For Port’s Convenience: The Port may terminate this Contract at any time, without cause and
           for any reason including The Port’s convenience, upon written notice to the Contractor.

        C. Non-appropriation of Funds: The Port may terminate this Contract at any time without notice
           due to non-appropriation of funds, whether such funds are local, state or federal grants, and
           no such notice shall be required notwithstanding any notice requirements that may be agreed
           upon for other causes of termination.

        D. Acts of Insolvency: The Port may terminate this Contract by written notice to Contractor. If the
           Contractor becomes insolvent, makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, suffers
           or permits the appointment of a receiver for its business or assets, becomes subject to any
            proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law whether domestic or foreign, or is wound
            up or liquidated, voluntarily or otherwise.


        E. Notice: The Port is not required to provide advance notice of termination. Notwithstanding,
           the Contract Administrator may issue a termination notice with an effective date later than the
           termination notice itself. In such case, the Contractor shall continue to provide products and
           services as required by the Contract Administrator until the effective date provided in the
           termination notice.


        F. Actions Upon Termination: In the event of termination not the fault of the Contractor, Contractor
           shall be paid for the services properly performed prior to the effective termination date that has
           been specified by the Contract Administrator, together with any reimbursable expenses then
           due, but in no event shall such compensation exceed the maximum compensation to be paid
           under the Contract. Contractor agrees that this payment shall fully and adequately compensate
           Contractor and all Subcontractors for all profits, costs, expenses, losses, liabilities, damages,
           taxes, and charges of any kind whatsoever (whether foreseen or unforeseen) attributable to
           the termination of this Contract. Upon termination for any reason, Contractor shall provide The
           Port with the most current design documents, contract documents, writings and other product
           it has completed to the date of termination, along with copies of all project-related
           correspondence and similar items. The Port shall have the same rights to use these materials
           as if termination had not occurred.

42. Force Majeure – Suspension and Termination
    This section applies in the event that either party is unable to perform the obligations of this contract
    because of a Force Majeure event as defined herein, to the extent that the Contract obligations must
    be suspended in full. A Force Majeure event is an event that prohibits performance and is beyond the
    control of the party. Such events may include natural or man-made disasters, or an action or decree
    of a superior governmental body, which prevents performance.

    Should either party suffer from a Force Majeure event and is unable to provide performance, such party
    shall give notice to the remaining party as soon as practical and shall do everything possible to resume
    performance.

    Upon receipt of such notice, the party shall be excused from such performance as is affected by the
    Force Majeure Event for the period of such Event. If such Event affects the delivery date or warranty
    provisions of this Agreement, such date or warranty period shall automatically be extended for a period
    equal to the duration of such Event.

43. Workers Right to Know
    “Right to Know” legislation required the Department of Labor and Industries to establish a program to
    make employers and employees more aware of the hazardous substances in their work environment.
    WAC 296-839-300 requires among other things that all manufacturers/distributors of hazardous
    substances, including any of the items listed on this RFP or contract bid and subsequent award must
    include with each delivery completed Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) or Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
    for each hazardous material. Additionally, each container of hazardous material must be appropriately
    labeled with the identity of the hazardous material, appropriate hazardous warnings, and the Name and
    Address of the chemical manufacturer, improper, or other responsible party.

    Labor and Industries may levy appropriate fines against employers for noncompliance and agencies
    may withhold payment-pending receipt of a legible copy of the MSDS/SDS. OSHA Form 20 is not
    acceptable in lieu of this requirement unless it is modified to include appropriate information relative to
    “carcinogenic ingredients: and “routes of entry” of the product(s) in question.

44. Miscellaneous Provisions
       A. Amendments: No modification of this Contract shall be effective unless in writing and signed
           by an authorized representative of the Port, except as otherwise authorized herein. The Port
           shall issue change notices to Contractor, and such notices shall take effect under the signature
           of the Port unless written objection of the notice is received by the Contractor upon their receipt
           of the change notice.

        B. Conflict: In the event of conflict between contract documents and applicable laws, codes,
           ordinances or regulations, the most stringent or legally binding requirement shall govern and
           be considered a part of this contract to afford The Port the maximum benefits.

        C. Liens, Claims and Encumbrances: All materials, equipment, or services shall be free of all
             liens, claims or encumbrances of any kind and if The Port requests a formal release of same
             shall be delivered to The Port.

        C. Binding Contract: This Contract shall not be binding until signed by both parties. The
           provisions, covenants and conditions in this Contract shall bind the parties, their legal heirs,
           representatives, successors, and assigns.

        D. Applicable Law/Venue: This Contract shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with
           the laws of the State of Washington. The venue of any action brought hereunder shall be in
           the Superior Court for Pierce County, Washington

        E. Remedies Cumulative: Rights under this Contract are cumulative and nonexclusive of any
           other remedy at law or in equity.

        F. Captions: All titles, including sections or subsections, are for convenience only and do not
           define or limit the contents.

        G. Severability: Any term or provision of this Contract found to be prohibited by law shall be
           ineffective to the extent of such prohibition without invalidating the remainder of the Contract.

        H. Waiver: No covenant, term, or the breach thereof shall be deemed waived, except by written
           consent of the party against whom the waiver is claimed. Any waiver of the breach of any
           covenant, term, or condition shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding
           breach of the same or any other covenant, term or condition. Neither, the acceptance by the
           Port of any performance by the Contractor after the time the same shall have become due nor
           payment to the Contractor for any portion of the Work, shall constitute a waiver by the Port of
           the breach or default of any covenant, term or condition unless otherwise this is expressly
           agreed to by The Port, in writing. The Port ’s failure to insist on performance of any of the terms
           or conditions herein or to exercise any right or privilege or the Port ’s waiver of any breach
           hereunder shall not thereafter waive any other term, condition, or privilege, whether of the same
           or similar type.

        I.   Entire Contract: This document, along with any attachments and work orders, constitutes the
             entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work. No verbal agreement or
             conversation between any officer, agent, associate or employee of The Port and any officer,
             agency, employee or associate of the Contractor prior to the execution of this Contract shall
             affect or modify any of the terms or obligations contained in this Contract.
        J.     Negotiated Contract: The parties acknowledge that this is a negotiated Contract, that they
               have had the opportunity to have this Contract reviewed by respective legal counsel, and that
               terms and conditions are not construed against any party on the basis of such party's
               draftsmanship thereof.

        K. No personal liability: No officer, agent or authorized employee of the Port shall be personally
           responsible for any liability arising under this Contract, whether expressed or implied, nor for
           any statement or representation made herein or in any connection with this Contract.
