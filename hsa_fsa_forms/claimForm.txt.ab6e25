     Claim Authorization
This certifies that my statements on this Claim Form are complete and true. I am claiming reimbursement only for eligible expenses incurred during the applicable plan year and for my eligible
dependents. I understand that it is my responsibility to submit only eligible expenses defined by My Company Plan’s parameters. I certify that these expenses have not been, nor will be,
reimbursed by any other benefit plan and will not be claimed as an income tax deduction. I also understand, to provide services to my employer in connection with one or more employee
benefit plans maintained by my employer, Employee Benefits Corporation may need “protected health information” regarding coverage or benefits for me or my dependents under the plan.
By submitting this Claim Form, I hereby acknowledge that Employee Benefits Corporation will obtain and use such information and disclose it to my employer (or to an insurer or other provider
of services related to the plan), but only for the purposes of the plan and only for as long as Employee Benefits Corporation is providing services regarding the plan. Any information disclosed
pursuant to this Claim Form will not be subject to redisclosure by the recipient, except for purposes of the plan.
By submitting this form I certify the above.
