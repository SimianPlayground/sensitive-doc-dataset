                                       Claim Form Instructions
Most UniView Vision plans allow members the choice to visit an in-network or out-of-network vision care
provider. You only need to complete this form if you are visiting a provider that is not a participating
provider in the UniView Vision network. Not all plans have out-of-network benefits, so please consult
your member benefits information to ensure coverage of services and/or materials from non-participating
providers.

If you choose an out-of-network provider, please complete the following steps prior to submitting the
claim form to UniView Vision. Any missing or incomplete information may result in delay of payment or
the form being returned. Please complete and send this form to UniView Vision within one (1) year from
the original date of service at the out-of-network provider’s office.


1. When visiting an out-of-network provider, you are responsible for payment of services and/or
   materials at the time of service. UniView Vision will reimburse you for authorized services according
   to your plan design.
2. Please complete all sections of this form to ensure proper benefit allocation. Plan information may be
   found on your benefit ID Card or via your human resources department.
3. UniView Vision will only accept itemized paid receipts that indicate the services provided and the
   amount charged for each service. The patient name and date of service must be included on the
   receipt. The services must be paid in full in order to receive benefits. Handwritten receipts must be
   on the provider’s letterhead. Attach itemized paid receipts from your provider to the claim form. If the
   paid receipt is not in US dollars, please identify the currency in which the receipt was paid.
