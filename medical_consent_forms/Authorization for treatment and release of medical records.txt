                                                                          RELEASE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION
1. CONSENT TO MEDICAL CARE AND TREATMENT
I am being treated at a Munson Healthcare physician office/clinic (“Physician Office”), and I consent to all medical and surgical care, examinations and tests
determined by the Physician Office to be necessary for me. Though I expect the care given will meet customary standards, I understand there are no guarantees
concerning the results of my care. I assume full risk and responsibility and release the Physician Office and any individual provider from responsibility for
things that might go wrong if I do not receive the medical care and treatment recommended to me. I understand that if an employee, physician, or affiliate of
Munson Healthcare becomes contaminated with my blood or body fluids through any type of exposure, that I may be tested for the Hepatitis Virus and/or the
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

2. CONSENT TO USE OF INFORMATION
Electronic Health Records: I understand that the Physician Office may collaborate with other health care providers to coordinate, manage, and provide health
care to me and I consent to the Physician Office’s sharing my health information and records electronically for the purposes of treatment, payment or
operations, including improving the overall quality of health care services provided to me (e.g., avoiding unnecessary or duplicate testing, etc.). I consent to the
inclusion in the electronic health records of sensitive diagnoses and related information such as HIV/AIDS status, sexually transmitted diseases, genetic
information, and mental health and substance abuse, etc. The electronic health records (EHR) will be accessible by Munson Healthcare credentialed
physicians/practitioners as well as other individuals approved to access the EHR for purposes related to treatment, payment, health care operations, and/or
other purposes permitted by federal and state laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). The Physician Office has
implemented administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality and integrity of my medical
information as required by HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2, where applicable.
Use and Disclosure of Information: In addition to the above consent to use and share my health information with the Munson Healthcare EHR system, I agree
that the Physician Office may use and disclose my health information for a range of purposes including: treatment, eligibility verification, and/or payment to
private and public payers or their agents including insurance companies, managed care organizations, my employer (if I am injured at work), state and federal
government programs, Workers’ Compensation programs, obtaining pre-admission or continued length of stay certification, quality of care assessment and
improvement activities, evaluating the performance of qualifications of physicians and health care workers, conducting medical and nursing training and
education programs, conducting or arranging for medical review, audit services, ensuring compliance with legal, regulatory and accreditation requirements and
public health and health oversight services.
Request for Information from Others: I consent to the Physician Office’s request of my health information from other providers of care to me, receipt of and
release of my health information, whether written, verbal, or electronic, for the uses described above as well as the Physician Office’s participation in the health
information exchange described in the Physician Office’s Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP). Please refer to the NPP for additional, detailed information
regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information.

3. ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS
I hereby assign to and authorize payment of all insurance and health care benefits available to me directly to the Physician Office for services provided to me. I
understand that benefits may be payable to me directly if I do not provide this authorization.

4. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
I understand and agree that I am financially responsible for payment of all charges incurred which are not paid by insurance or health care benefits, including
any and all products provided or services rendered to me which are not eligible for payment (non-covered) under health care plans, Medicare, Medicaid or
other insurance or payers (e.g., services rendered by health care providers who do not participate with my insurance plan). Non-covered services also may
include those services my physician determines to be medically necessary, but are later determined unnecessary by the payer.

5. PERSONAL VALUABLES. I understand that the Physician Office does not accept responsibility for any lost, stolen or damaged personal items while
I am at the Physician Office.

6. SUPPORT PERSON. I understand that the Physician Office allows for a support person during my visit and I will let my provider or the staff know if I
would like a support person present.

7. TREATMENT OF MINORS. I, as parent/guardian of a minor receiving treatment, acknowledge that I have been advised to remain on the premises
during such treatment, and waive any claim I may have that results from failure to do so.
