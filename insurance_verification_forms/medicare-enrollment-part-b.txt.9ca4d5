IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
Review the scenario below to determine if you need to include additional information or forms with your application.
If you’re signing up for Part B using a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) because you were covered under a group health plan
based on current employment, in addition to this application, you will also need to have your employer fill out and return
the “Request for Employment Information” form (CMS-L564/CMS-R-297) with your application. The purpose of this form is
to provide documentation to Social Security that proves that you have been continuously covered by a group health plan
based on current employment, with no more than 8 consecutive months of not having coverage. If your employer went out of
business or refuses to complete the form, please contact Social Security about other information you may be able to provide to
process your SEP enrollment request.
Send the application (and the “Request for Employment Information,” if applicable) to your local Social Security Office. Find
your local office at www.ssa.gov.
