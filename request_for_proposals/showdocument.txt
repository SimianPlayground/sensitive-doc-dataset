           STORM WATER MAINTENANCE, INSPECTION AND REPAIR SERVICES


                  SECTION 1: BACKGROUND AND GENERAL INFORMATION

A.     Purpose and Summary of Procurement

The City of Sandy Springs (“City”) is seeking proposals (“Proposals”) from highly qualified firms to
provide all personnel, materials and services necessary to provide Storm Water Maintenance,
Inspection and Repair for the City more particularly described in Section 2: Scope of Services.
Services provided by the successful firm in this procurement shall be managed and directed by the
City.
The City contemplates award of fixed price contract(s) resulting from the RFP which provide the best
overall value to the City. The City reserves the right to make a single award or no award, if these
options are in the City’s best interest.

This is a best value source selection procurement, based upon the performance price trade-off
(“PPT”) model. This process is a simplified best value source selection strategy that permits a trade-
off between price and performance in reaching the award decision. There are three (3) evaluation
factors: Capabilities and Approaches, Performance Confidence, and Cost/Price. The City intends to
enter into one (1) or more contracts containing the terms, conditions, and specifications of the model
contract attached to this RFP as Exhibit D (“Model Contract”).

Section 3 of this RFP contains instructions for presenting and formatting Proposals. Section 4
describes the information that should be contained in the Proposal, and how it should be organized.
The information and instructions contained in this RFP are designed to assist Offerors in preparing
a complete response that reflects the proposed approach to accomplish all contractual requirements.
Section 5 provides further detail as to how Proposals will be evaluated.

The City may award without discussions. Therefore, the Offeror’s Proposal should contain the
Offeror’s best terms for Capabilities and Approaches, Performance Confidence and Cost/Price, as
described herein. The City reserves the right to conduct discussions if they are later determined to
be necessary. If the City awards without discussions, the Offeror may be given the opportunity to
clarify certain aspects of its Proposal or to resolve minor or clerical errors.

B.    General Information About the City

Located in Atlanta’s dynamic metro north and less than an hour from the world’s busiest airport,
Sandy Springs is the metro area’s second largest City and is the sixth largest City in the State of
Georgia. The City balances the best of modern southern living: high-rise towers; riding stables; world-
class medical centers; national river corridor; fortune 500 corporate headquarters international
consulates; and neighborhoods that resemble botanical gardens.

In June 2005, residents overwhelmingly voted for incorporation, making Sandy Springs the first new
city in Georgia in fifty (50) years. The City utilizes an innovative public-private partnership (“PPP”)
model for operations and strives to sustain and further the attractive quality of life enjoyed by its
residents. This model provides a flexible and creative approach to anticipate and respond to the

Page 6 of 56
needs of the community. Aside from public safety (police and fire) and the City Manager’s executive
staff, general municipal services are provided by contractors working collaboratively with the City to
provide a high level of services to Sandy Springs residents. This customer-focused mission has
resulted in numerous awards and recognitions, including: Ranked 36 as Most Livable Mid-Size City
in the U.S. (City Biz); Fourth as Best City for Early Retirement (Kiplinger); Best Towns for Millennials
(Niche Magazine); and Top Ten Safest Places in Georgia (Value Penguin). The success of this PPP
model in Sandy Springs continues to attract attention from cities around the U.S. as well as around
the globe.

The City’s population was estimated at 99,419 by the 2012 Census. Daytime population swells to
more than 200,000 due to the heavy concentration of businesses located in the City, including UPS,
Newell Rubbermaid, First Data, AirWatch, Cox Enterprises, Intercontinental Exchange (corporate
parent of the New York Stock Exchange), and the recent announcement of Mercedes relocation of
its corporate headquarters to Sandy Springs. Two (2) of the most traveled arteries in the metro area,

*Key personnel Resumes and Commitment Letters are in addition to the individual volume page limits.

                  a.    Presentation. Offerors shall submit the four (4) volumes shown above, which
           are:

                          i.   Volume I - Capabilities and Approaches
                         ii.   Volume II – Performance Confidence
                        iii.   Volume III – Cost/Price
                        iv.    Volume IV - Model Contract

           Volumes shall be separately bound in three (3) ring binders that permit the volume to lie
           flat when open. Staples shall not be used. A cover sheet shall be included on each binder,
           clearly marked with date of offer, volume number, title, copy number, RFP number and
           the Offeror's name. The same identifying data should be placed on the spine of each
           binder. Information should not be incorporated by reference. A suitable table of contents
           shall be provided with each volume for ready reference to sections, tables, and figures. All
           pages in each volume shall be numbered sequentially with Arabic numerals for contents
           subject to page limitations or with lower case Roman numerals for introductory contents
           (e.g., title pages, tables of contents, and acronym lists). Offerors shall tab each subsection
           within each volume for ease of reference. Tabs and dividers are not included in the page
           count limits.

                b.   Proposal Page Limitations. The following page limitations are established for
           Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation.




RFP #18-004 Storm Water Maintenance, Inspection and Repair Services
Page 21 of 56
                      i.   Title pages, tabs, dividers, tables of contents and compliance matrices
                     are excluded from the page counts specified above. Additionally, all sections
                     of the Proposal that are not page limited shall be strictly limited to only the
                     information as requested by this solicitation for that section. Information that
                     can be construed as belonging in one (1) of the other sections of the Proposal
                     will be so construed and counted against that section's page limitation, if
                     applicable.

                     ii.   A page is defined as one (1) side of a sheet, 8 1/2" x 11", with at least
                     one (1) inch margins on all sides, using Calibri 12-point font. No less than
                     Calibri 10-point font shall be used for figures and tables. Foldouts count as an
                     equivalent number of 8 1/2" x 11" pages (e.g., 11" x 17" foldout counts as two
                     (2) pages). The metric standard format most closely approximating the
                     described standard 8 1/2" x 11" size may also be used.

                     iii.   If final Proposal revisions ("FPR") are requested, separate page
                      limitations will be specified by the City.

                     iv.   Pages submitted in excess of the limitations specified in this provision will
                      not be considered or evaluated by the City.

             c.   Proposal Copies. Proposals shall be submitted in the number of copies
       indicated.

                 SECTION 4: PROPOSAL CONTENTS AND ORGANIZATION

A.     General Instructions for Proposal Preparation

This section provides detailed instructions to Offerors to be used in the preparation of Proposals.
This section is organized as follows:

            Introduction
            Period Covered by Procurement
            Executive Summary
            Most Important Requirements
            Volume I - Capabilities and Approaches
            Volume II- Performance Confidence
            Volume Ill - Cost/Price Proposal
            Volume IV - Model Contract

In providing these instructions, the City's intention is to solicit information that will permit a
comprehensive evaluation of the Offeror's Proposal. The information solicited will demonstrate
the Offeror's competence and capability to successfully complete the requirements specified in
the Statement of Work (SOW). Generally, the Proposal shall:

            Demonstrate the Offeror’s understanding of the general and task order specific
             requirements of the RFP and Model Contract;
            Convey the Offeror's capabilities for transforming understanding of the requirements
             into accomplishment;
            Provide in detail the Offeror's plans and methods for so doing; and
            Provide, as requested below, the cost/price associated with so doing.

The Proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and
substantiation of all information. The Proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the City's
requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to
meet these requirements. Elaborate brochures or documentation, detailed artwork, or other
superfluous embellishments are unnecessary and are, in fact, discouraged.

Offerors are requested to provide information responsive to the items set forth below. This
information is considered essential for the City to conduct a fair and uniform evaluation of
Proposals in accordance with the evaluation factors and subfactors provided in Section 5. The
items listed are not, however, all-inclusive and the Offeror should include in its Proposal any
further discussion believed to be necessary or useful in demonstrating the Offeror's ability to
perform the work under the Contract.

The City will not accept Proposals with alternate terms and conditions.

The RFP will enable the City to gather additional information and identify one (1) or more qualified
firms to perform the services described in the Scope of Services. The City will conduct a
comprehensive, fair and impartial evaluation of all Proposals received. An evaluation team will be
established by the City to evaluate Proposals (“Evaluation Committee”). The Evaluation
Committee may invite the most qualified Offerors to interview; however, the City retains the right
to select only one (1) Offeror and negotiate a contract. The City may also determine that no
qualified Proposals have been received and reject all Proposals.

B.     Basis for Contract Award

This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance
history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By
submission of a Proposal, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and
conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those
identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. All technically acceptable Proposals shall be treated
equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result
in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. The City reserves the right to reject any
Proposal that takes exception to the solicitation terms and conditions. The evaluation process shall
proceed as follows:

        1.    Technical Acceptability Evaluation (Volume I). Initially, the City's capabilities and
approaches evaluation team shall evaluate the technical Proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning
ratings of "Acceptable", "Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable", or "Unacceptable".
The Proposals shall be evaluated against the following factors and subfactors:

              a.   Factor 1 - General Requirements. This factor focuses on the Offeror's
       relationship and interactions with the City and its resident customers. Three (3) subfactors
       shall be evaluated.

                    i.  Subfactor 1 – Accountability. This subfactor addresses the Offeror's
                   approach to improve measures of performance against contract requirements.
                   Topics evaluated include the Offeror's processes and approach to manage
                   work, methods to measure and improve performance, approach to ensure
                   customer satisfaction and change management.

                             Management: The City will evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency and
                              feasibility of the proposed approach to planning, tracking and
                              controlling cost, schedule, and risk for all work and monitoring
                              performance to maintain and enhance the quality of services
                              provided.

                             Performance Measurement and Customer Satisfaction: The City will
                              evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed customer
                              service and performance measurement approaches.

                             Changes: The City will evaluate the approach to contract change
                              management including the effectiveness at minimizing contract
                              changes and controlling costs to the City. The contract change
                              management process will also be evaluated regarding the extent
                              that the process fosters a collaborative environment with the City.

                  ii.    Subfactor 2 – Responsiveness. This subfactor focuses on the Offeror's
                  ability and commitment to ensure timely response to the City's requests and
                  inquiries. Topics evaluated include the Offeror's organization structure, the
                  authority and autonomy of the on-site work package lead, and the Offeror's
                  strategy to communicate and collaborate with City officials.

                             Organization: The City will evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency and
                              feasibility of the proposed approach to organize its resources to
                              perform the contract requirements. The role and responsibilities of
                              proposed subcontractors, teaming and/or joint venture partners will
                              be evaluated to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of their
                              contribution to deliver the required services. The City will evaluate
                              the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach to manage team
                              members.

                             Authority and Autonomy: The City will evaluate the on-site lead’s
                              position within the corporate organization structure with respect to
                              level of autonomy and level of recurring reporting and accountability
                              to corporate.

                             Communication and Collaboration Strategy: The City will evaluate
                              the effectiveness of the proposed communications and collaboration
                              strategy that illustrates how information will be shared with the City.

                  iii.    Subfactor 3 – Continuity. This subfactor addresses the Offeror's approach
                   to maintain a continuous high-level of service throughout contract transition.
                   Topics evaluated include the Offeror's phase-in organization, schedule of
                   phase-in activities, measures of phase- in performance, approach to secure and
                   train the initial staff including sources of personnel and methods to attract and
                   retain qualified incumbent personnel, approach to work with the City and
                   incumbent contractors to ensure continuity of service, approach to implement
                   subcontracted activities if applicable, approach to inventory and accept
                   responsibility for City provided property, and approach to identify and mitigate
                   phase-in risk.

                  The City will evaluate the phase-in plan for effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility,
                  completeness and level of detail that demonstrates the ability to assume full
                  responsibility for contract performance including the effectiveness of the
                  proposed workforce and its ability to provide uninterrupted, continuous, high
                  quality service. The City will evaluate risk in the transition period for impact
                  (likelihood and consequence) and mitigation strategies. Proposals will be
                  evaluated to assess the completeness, comprehension, and technical merit of



RFP #18-004 Storm Water Maintenance, Inspection and Repair Services
Page 32 of 56
                  the proposed phase-in plan and transition activities and approach. Proposals
                  will be evaluated on the realism of assumptions, appropriateness of
                  understanding of external dependencies, and the details in the proposed
                  phasing of transition responsibilities. The evaluation will assess the realism of
                  the proposed schedule and the likelihood for successful performance at the end
                  of the phase-in period. The City will consider the adequacy of the processes to
                  ensure the orderly transition of ongoing work, the proposed phase-in
                  organization, schedule, schedule milestones, staffing plan, alternate/backup
                  staffing plans, subcontracting activities, orientation and training of personnel,
                  and inventory of City-furnished property.

            b.    Factor 2 - Task Specific Requirements. This factor focuses on the Offeror's
       approach to enhance capability and innovation in providing the Scope of Services
       described in this RFP. The evaluation shall address five (5) subfactors: technical approach,
       innovation, staffing, key positions/key personnel and property.

                   i.   Subfactor 1 - Technical Approach. This subfactor addresses the Offeror's
                  overall approach and processes to perform the requirements of the contract,
                  and in particular, methods that are demonstrated to have produced efficiencies
                  that resulted in staff reductions, as well as the significant risks associated with
                  the requirements and approach to risk mitigation.

                  The City will evaluate how well the Proposal demonstrates understanding of the
                  nature of the work and provides comprehensive and effective solutions to the
                  most significant risks. The City neither expects nor encourages a line-by-line
                  discussion of your approach to perform contract requirements; rather, the City
                  is interested in your understanding of the nature of the work and appreciation
                  for significant risks.

                  ii.   Subfactor 2 – Innovation. This subfactor focuses on the City's goal to
                  continuously improve the delivery of service to residents of the City. Topics
                  evaluated include the Offeror's approach to identify, evaluate and adopt
                  innovative technologies, and the Offeror's proposal to implement proven
                  innovations during the initial performance period.

                  The City will examine the approach to stay abreast of innovative technologies
                  that improve processes, systems, or techniques required to perform the
                  contract, the process for evaluating and adopting innovations over the course
                  of the contract, and the innovation proposed to be implemented during the initial
                  contract period of performance. The City will evaluate proposed innovations for
                  their feasibility and suitability to be implemented in the City.

                  iii.    Subfactor 3 – Staffing. This subfactor addresses the Offeror's approach to
                   staffing. The Offeror's proposed staffing shall be fully consistent with and
                   provide justification for the proposed cost/price. Topics evaluated include the
                   Offeror's proposed skill mix (labor categories and number of personnel) and the
                   rationale supporting the proposed skill mix to include any assumptions




RFP #18-004 Storm Water Maintenance, Inspection and Repair Services
Page 33 of 56
                  regarding the Factor 1- General Requirements or Factor 2 - Task Specific
                  Requirements that influence staffing levels or skills.

                  The City will evaluate staffing based on the following:

                             Your understanding of the labor categories and skill mix necessary
                              to perform the requirements of the contract for effectiveness,
                              soundness, feasibility, and efficiency.

                             Rationale for the proposed skill mix and number of personnel for
                              suitability and efficiency to perform the contract requirements.

                             Assumptions for reasonableness and their impact on the proposed
                              skill mix and number of personnel.

                             Selection of key positions for their effectiveness in controlling and
                              contributing to the critical aspects of contract performance.

                  iv.    Subfactor 4 - Key Positions/Key Personnel. This subfactor addresses the
                   Offeror's proposals identifying positions that are critical to successful contract
                   performance and the Offeror's plan to staff the identified positions. The Offeror's
                   proposals for key positions and key position staffing shall be fully consistent with
                   and provide justification for the proposed cost/price. Topics evaluated include
                   the selection of key positions for their effectiveness in controlling and
                   contributing to the critical aspects of contract performance. Proposed key
                   personnel will be evaluated on their education, experience and qualifications,
                   past performance, commitment, and overall capability to determine if they are
                   appropriate for the positions and capable of performing in the areas proposed.

                  The City will evaluate the selection of key positions for their effectiveness in
                  controlling and contributing to the critical aspects of contract performance. The
                  City will evaluate the proposed key personnel on education, experience and
                  qualifications, past performance, commitment, and overall capability to
                  determine if they are appropriate for the positions and capable of performing
                  the areas proposed.

                  v.    Subfactor 5 – Property. This subfactor addresses the Offeror's
                  identification of property (furniture, fixtures, supplies, equipment, vehicles,
                  computers, workstations, copiers, printers, etc.) necessary for the Offeror to
                  accomplish the requirements of the contract. Topics evaluated include quantity
                  of property specified, rationale offered by the Offeror to justify its property
                  proposal, and the reasonableness and consistency of the property proposal with
                  the Offeror's technical approach and staffing plan.

                  The City will evaluate the property response for reasonableness and
                  consistency with your technical approach and staffing plan.

              c.   Technical Acceptability Evaluation Process. The technical acceptability rating is
       based on the Offeror's response to both Factor 1- General Requirements and Factor 2 -
       Task Specific Requirements. General Requirements evaluation focuses on the Offeror's
       ability to successfully perform work for the City. Task Specific Requirements evaluation
       focuses on the unique requirements of the Scope of Services.

       The Offeror's response to Factor 1 - General Requirements shall be evaluated on a
       pass/fail basis and rated "Acceptable", "Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made
       Acceptable" or "Unacceptable". If an Offeror's response to Factor 1 - General
       Requirements is rated "Unacceptable", the Proposal shall be eliminated from further
       consideration. Only Proposals rated "Acceptable" or "Reasonably Susceptible of Being
       Made Acceptable" on Factor 1 - General Requirements shall be continued to the Task
       Specific Requirements phase of the evaluation.

       The Offeror's response to Factor 2 - Task Specific Requirements shall be evaluated on a
       pass/fail basis and rated "Acceptable", "Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made
       Acceptable" or "Unacceptable". Proposals rated "Unacceptable" shall be eliminated from
       further consideration.

       Only Proposals rated "Acceptable" or "Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable"
       for both Factor 1 - General Requirements and Factor 2 - Task Specific Requirements shall
       be considered for price and performance confidence evaluation.

        2.  Cost/Price Evaluation (Volume III). Next, the City shall rank all technically
"Acceptable" and "Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable" Proposals by price,
including any option prices if applicable. The Offeror's proposed price shall be determined by
examining the, cost/price templates and pricing rationale presented in Volume Ill - Cost/Price
Proposal.

NOTE: Information provided in the cost/price templates will be considered when evaluating
cost/price realism and reasonableness.

            a.   Evaluation Criterion. The cost/price evaluation shall             document     the
       reasonableness and realism of the proposed total evaluated cost/price.

                   i.  Reasonableness. The City has established its own independent
                  government estimate (“IGE”) of what the cost/price should be and will compare
                  each Proposal to the IGE to assess reasonableness. The City's IGE is based
                  on data derived from multiple sources and determined to be suitable for the
                  Storm Water Maintenance, Inspection and Repair.

                  ii.   Realism. The City will examine the calculations,             rationale and
                  assumptions in each Cost/Price Proposal to determine if             the proposed
                  cost/price is realistic. In addition, the City will determine if    the proposed
                  cost/price consistent with the proposed technical and                management
                  approaches.




RFP #18-004 Storm Water Maintenance, Inspection and Repair Services
Page 35 of 56
             b.    Ranking Offers by Cost/Price.

                    i.   Original Submission Cost/Price. The Offeror's original submission
                   cost/price shall be used to rank Proposals. The City may make selection and
                   award without discussions (Offerors may be contacted only for clarification
                   purposes). Therefore, the Offeror's original submission should contain the
                   Offeror's best terms.

                   ii.   Final Proposal Revisions (“FPR”) Cost/Price. If the City engages in
                   discussions regarding Proposals, the City shall rank Offerors' Proposals by FPR
                   cost/price following discussions to determine the Proposals eligible for award.
                   Best value awards shall be made based on this ranking.

        3.   Performance Confidence Assessment (Volume II). The City shall evaluate each
Offeror's performance based on (1) the description of past and present efforts provided by the
Offeror, (2) questionnaire responses provided by the Offeror's references, and (3) data
independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.

             a.   Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving a scope of
       services that is similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort
       described in this solicitation. The City will give preferential consideration to recent, relevant
       performance.

                    i.   Recent Performance. Recent performance is defined as current
                   performance, i.e., performance that is taking place at the present time, or
                   performance occurring within the last three (3) years. Current performance will
                   generally have greater impact in the performance assessment than recent
                   performance. Performance that is more recent will have more impact than less
                   recent performance.

                   ii.   Relevant Performance. Relevant performance has a logical connection to
                   the work described in the RFP and shall be characterized as "very relevant",
                   "relevant", "somewhat relevant" or "not relevant" as follows:

                            Very Relevant - Present/past performance involving essentially the
                             same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

                            Relevant - Present/past performance involving much of the magnitude
                             of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

                            Somewhat Relevant - Present/past performance contractual effort
                             involving some of the magnitude of effort and complexities that this
                             solicitation requires.

                            Not Relevant - Present/past performance did not involve any of the
                             magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.




RFP #18-004 Storm Water Maintenance, Inspection and Repair Services

            b.    The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the City to assess
       the Offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP based on the Offeror's
       demonstrated recent, relevant performance. The assessment process will result in an
       overall performance confidence assessment of "Substantial Confidence", "Satisfactory
       Confidence", "Limited Confidence", or "No Confidence" as follows:

                           Substantial Confidence: Based on the Offeror's performance record,
                            the City has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully
                            perform the required effort.

                           Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the Offeror's performance
                            record, the City has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully
                            perform the required effort.

                           Limited Confidence: Based on the Offeror's performance record, the
                            City has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform
                            the required effort.

                           No Confidence: Based on the Offeror's performance record, the City
                            has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform
                            the required effort.

             c.   Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have
       relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the
       requirement will be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal
       Offeror.

            d.    In evaluating past performance, the City reserves the right to give greater
       consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort
       described in this RFP.

        5.    Acceptance of Best Value Offer. If the lowest priced evaluated Technically
Acceptable Proposal is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence
assessment, that Proposal represents the best value for the City and the evaluation process stops
at this point. Award shall be made to that Offeror without further consideration of any other
Proposals.

       6.    Award to Other Than Lowest Priced Offer. The City reserves the right to award a
Contract to other than the lowest priced Proposal if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a
performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the City
shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.

        7.     Clarification/Communication with Offeror. Offerors are cautioned to submit
sufficient information in the format specified in this RFP. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain
aspects of their Proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the Offeror
has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past
performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or
any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.



RFP #18-004 Storm Water Maintenance, Inspection and Repair Services
Page 37 of 56
Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and
the City reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for Proposal revision.

        7.   Interviews. At the City’s discretion, selected Offerors may be interviewed and re-
evaluated based upon the criteria set out in the RFP, or other criteria to be determined by the
Evaluation Committee (i.e. unique qualities, methodologies, or approaches taken to differentiate
from other Offerors). Selected Offerors may be asked to provide additional information to the
Evaluation Committee regarding demonstrated competence and qualifications, feasibility of
implementing the Project as proposed, ability to meet schedules, costing methodology, or other
factors as appropriate.

Any information received by the Evaluation Committee subsequent to the Offeror’s Proposal will
be used to further evaluate the short-listed Offerors to determine a rank-order. Final approval of
a selected Offeror is subject to the City’s Purchasing Policies.

        8.    Methods of Selection. The City will use, depending on the specific circumstances of
the offers received, one (1) of the following methods to select the best value Proposal: (1) make
selection and award without discussions (Offerors may be contacted only for clarification
purposes); or (2) after discussions with all Offerors in the competitive range, afford each Offeror
within the competitive range an opportunity to revise its Proposal, and then make selection.
Therefore, the Offeror's initial Proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.

        9.   Negotiation and Best and Final Offer. If the City deems it is in its best interest to
retain the services of one (1) or more Offerors, the City reserves the right to negotiate a revised
scope and or fees. Negotiations will encompass all phases of work, including but not limited to:
hourly rates, fees for services, markups for overhead and profit on subcontractors, a “not to
exceed” contract amount, as well as any other items the City deems appropriate.

Qualified firms submitting Responses will be required to submit financial statements for a
minimum of three recording periods prior to contract award.

Separate meetings with more than one Offeror may be conducted during the same time frame;
however, negotiation sessions with an Offeror will not be held in the presence of another Offeror.

Offerors submitting Proposals should be aware that the Evaluation Committee has sole discretion
to determine what constitutes the “best qualified offer” for the City. Consequently, Offerors are
urged to submit best possible terms in their original submittal.

        10. Offer Acceptance Period. Proposals submitted in response to this RFP shall
remain firm for two hundred seventy (270) days after the date specified for receipt by the City and
shall contain a statement to this effect.

       11. Additional Basic Ordering Agreement Awards. The City reserves the right to
award additional basic ordering agreements for the Scope of Services described in this RFP. An
Offeror submitting a Proposal that is deemed “Technically Acceptable” by the Evaluation
Committee and is judged to have a performance confidence assessment rating of “Satisfactory
Confidence” or higher, but is not awarded a Contract effective July 1, 2017, may be considered



RFP #18-004 Storm Water Maintenance, Inspection and Repair Services
Page 38 of 56
eligible for Contract award in the future (“Eligible Offeror”). If the Contract awarded pursuant to this
RFP is terminated for any reason, the City reserves the right to request from an Eligible Offeror a
current Cost/Price Proposal and an executed Contract for consideration of award. The City also
reserves the right to request such other documents at that time as deemed necessary to consider
whether or not to make a Contract award, or it may determine to pursue other methods available
to it to procure required services.

C.     Evaluation Criteria

        1.    Volume I - Capabilities and Approaches. Specific evaluation criteria for each factor
and subfactor are presented in Section 5.B.1 – Technical Acceptability Evaluation. The general
criterions are: effectiveness, efficiency and feasibility.

              a.   Effectiveness. The effectiveness criterion addresses doing the right job. This
       criterion focuses the evaluation on the Offeror's understanding of the requirement. Does
       the Offeror understand and acknowledge the nature of the work to be done?

            b.    Efficiency. The efficiency criterion addresses doing the job right. This criterion
       focuses the evaluation on the Offeror's approach to perform the requirement. How well can
       the Offeror be expected to perform the work? Will the Offeror's approach result in
       successful performance outcomes?

            c.    Feasibility. The feasibility criterion focuses on risk. Is the Offeror's approach
       consistent with generally accepted or proven methods to perform the work? If not, why
       does the Offeror expect the proposed approach to be successful? How does the Offeror
       propose to manage any risk inherent in the approach?

         2.   Volume II - Performance Confidence. Performance confidence evaluation criteria,
i.e., recency and relevance, and the overall confidence assessment criteria are detailed in Section
5.B.3 - Performance Confidence Assessment.

      3.   Volume III - Cost/Price Proposal. Cost/price evaluation criteria,                       i.e.,
reasonableness and realism, are detailed in Section 5.B.2 - Cost/Price Evaluation.

       4.   Volume IV - Model Contract. The Offeror's data entered in the Model Contract shall
be reviewed for accuracy and completeness.

            STORM WATER MAINTENANCE, INSPECTION AND REPAIR SERVICES

I.       REFERENCE CONTRACT IDENTIFICATION (to be completed by Offeror, the
         Contractor for this Contract Reference)

     Contractor (Company/Division/
                    Mailing Address):
                   Contract Number:
                      Contract Type:
                      Contract Value:
                Contract Description:
       Period of Performance (basic
                    and any options):
       During this contract period of
        performance, this Contractor
           was the Prime Contractor,
     Subcontractor, Other (explain):
     If not a Prime Contractor, what
             is the percentage of the

                          Contractor:

II.PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE EVALUATION (to be completed by Respondent)
The Performance Confidence evaluation assesses the Contractor’s performance under previously
awarded contracts with the same or similar requirements. The Performance Confidence evaluation is
an assessment of the City’s level of confidence in the Contractor’s ability to perform the solicitation
requirements as described in the City’s Scope of Services for the referenced procurement. Use the
following adjectival ratings to respond to the questions below. Please select one rating per statement,
using the following definitions, and provide additional remarks to further explain any rating.

 Performance         Definition
 Exceptional         The Contractor’s performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds
                     many (requirements) to the Government’s benefit. The contractual
                     performance was accomplished with few minor problems for which
                     corrective actions taken by the Contractor were highly effective.
 Satisfactory        The Contractor’s performance meets contractual requirements. The
                     contractual performance contained some minor problems for which
                     corrective actions taken by the Contractor were satisfactory.
 Marginal            Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The
                     contractual performance reflects a serious problem for which the Contractor
                     has not yet identified corrective actions or the Contractor’s proposed
                     actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.
 Poor                Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is
                     not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance contains serious
                     problem(s) for which the Contractor’s corrective actions were ineffective.

WHEREAS, the City has a need to acquire the services described in the Scope of Services
attached hereto as Exhibit A (hereafter “Services”) (note that “Services” includes Services
performed, workmanship, and material furnished or utilized in the performance of services
pursuant to this Contract); and

WHEREAS, Contractor is willing and able to render the Services and wishes to perform the
Services for the City; and

WHEREAS, the City wishes to acquire the Services from Contractor;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual terms, conditions and covenants set forth
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

A.     Services.

Contractor hereby agrees to render the Services to the City as set forth in the Scope of Services
attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by this reference. Contractor agrees to
perform the Services at the direction of the Sandy Springs Public Works Department Director, or
designee, in the manner and to the extent required by the parties herein, as may be amended
hereafter in writing by mutual agreement of the parties.

B.     Compensation.

       1.    Fee. As consideration for the Services, the City shall pay to Contractor the fee
described in Exhibit B attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

       2.     Manner of Payment. Contractor shall, on a monthly basis, prepare and submit to
the Sandy Springs Finance Department an invoice, indicating work performed and approved
and additional equipment expenses incurred during the applicable time period, together with
such supporting documentation as may be required by the City. Each compliant invoice shall be
paid within thirty (30) days after submission of an invoice.

       3.    Notice of the City’s Use of Outside Contractors to Review Submitted Invoices. The
City may utilize support contractors to assist the City in the review and evaluation of
Contractor’s invoices and similar requests for payment or evidence of delivery. Support
contractors will be provided access to these and other records to support City officials in
reviewing and reconciling invoices, payment records, and the City’s financial and budgetary
records, and in facilitating the timely payment of submitted invoices. Such documents and
records may contain the proprietary information of Contractor including, but not limited to,
awarded contracts.

Each of the support contractor employees may, at the direction of Contractor to the City
Manager, be required to execute a non-disclosure agreement which acknowledges that the
support contractor employees:

       a.    Shall use proprietary information only in performance of the above tasks and for no
       other reason;

       b.    Shall not share proprietary information with his or her employer;

       c.    Shall not use such information for personal or other benefit; and

       d.   Shall promptly notify his or her employer of any breach of his or her
       responsibilities.

Unless Contractor specifically objects in writing, Contractor agrees, by the submission of a
proposal, to allow the City’s support contractors to have access to Contractor’s proprietary
information for the purposes described above. Contractor is required to promptly notify the City
Manager of any breach of the non-disclosure obligations of this section.

C.     Inspection of Services.

       1.    Contractor shall provide and maintain a system, acceptable to the City, for
inspecting all Services it provides under this Contract. Complete records of all inspection work
performed by Contractor shall be maintained and made available to the City during Contract
performance and for a period of three (3) years following Contract termination.

       2.    The City has the right to inspect and test all Services called for by the Contract, to
the extent practicable, at all times and places during the term of the Contract. The City shall
perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

       3.   If the City performs inspections or tests on the premises of Contractor or a
subcontractor, Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no
increase in the Contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and
convenient performance of these duties.

       4.    (a) If any of the Services do not conform to Contract requirements or industry
             standards, the City may require Contractor to perform the Services again in
            conformity with Contract requirements, at no increase in Contract amount. When
            the defects in Services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the City may:

                   i.   Require Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future
                  performance conforms to Contract requirements; and

                  ii.   Reduce the Contract price to reflect the reduced value of the Services
                  performed.

            (b) If Contractor subsequently fails again to take the necessary action to ensure
            future performance in conformity with Contract requirements, the City may:

                   i.  By contract or otherwise, perform the Services and charge to Contractor
                  any cost incurred by the City that is directly related to the performance of
                  such Services; or

                  ii.  Terminate the Contract for default by procedures set forth in this

it sees fit, or its responsibility to fill key personnel positions with qualified personnel.

       4.    Identification of Employees and Vehicles. Contractor employees shall wear
__________________________________________________________                  when    they     are

        any extension.

        b.    Contractor has refused or failed, except in the case for which an extension of time
        is provided, to supply properly skilled personnel.

        c.   Contractor has failed to obtain the approval of the City where required by this
        Contract.

        d.    Contractor has made a representation or warranty hereunder that was false or
        inaccurate in any material respect when made, or which materially and adversely affects
        the legality of this Contract or the ability of either party to carry out its obligations
        hereunder.

        e.    Contractor fails to perform any of the other provisions of this Contract, subject to
        any right to cure, or resolve a dispute.

        f.     Contractor has been adjudged as bankrupt or Contractor makes a general
        assignment for the benefit of creditors, appoints a receiver on account of insolvency, or
        files a petition to take advantage of any debtor’s act.

        2.   In the event of a default, this Contract may be terminated by the City after written
notice to Contractor of the default, which notice shall specify the default, provide both a demand
to cure the default and a reasonable time to cure the default and state a date upon which the
Contract shall be terminated if there is a failure to timely cure the default. For purposes of this
section, “reasonable time” shall be ten (10) calendar days except when the failure to perform
Services affects the public health, safety or welfare, in which case reasonable time may be less
than ten (10) days. A failure to cure a default within the specified time shall result in termination
of the Contract on the date set forth in the notice of default if such notice of default has not been
removed in writing by the City. Contractor’s right to cure pursuant to this subparagraph shall not
be applicable to a default under the provisions of Section W.3, Failure to Comply with
Provisions.

        3.    The Contractor shall be liable for all damages resulting from the default.
       4.    If this Contract is terminated in whole or in part, the City may acquire, under the

terminated, and the Contractor will be liable to the City for any excess costs for those Services;
however, the Contractor shall continue the work not terminated.

        5.    If this Contract is terminated in whole or in part, the Contractor shall protect and
preserve Property in its possession in which the City has an interest, until the Contractor is
relieved of this need.

        6.    The Contractor shall not be deemed in violation of this Contract if it is prevented
from performing its obligations under the Contract for any reason beyond its control including,
but not limited to, acts of God, civil or military authority, acts of public enemies, accidents, fires,
explosions, earthquakes, floods or catastrophic failures of public transportation; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall relieve or be construed to relieve the Contractor from
performing its obligations hereunder in the event of riots, rebellions or legal strikes.

       7.    If, after termination, it is determined that the Contractor was not in default, or that
the default was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the
termination had been issued for the convenience of the City.

       8.   The rights and remedies of the City in this section are in addition to any other rights
and remedies available to the City at law or in equity or under this Contract. The exercise of one
(1) remedy shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise any other remedy.

In the event of full or partial termination or expiration of this Contract, Contractor shall cooperate
in good faith to effect a smooth and harmonious transition from Contractor to the City, or to any
other person or entity the City may designate, and to maintain during such period of transition

          3.    Contractor is not subject to any statute, regulation, ordinance or rule that will limit
its ability to perform its obligations under this Contract; and

Q.     Proprietary Information; Non-Solicitation.

and other information proprietary to the City including, but not limited to, information concerning
the City, its operations, customers, citizens, business and financial condition, as well as

(collectively referred to herein as “Proprietary Information”). Contractor agrees not to disclose,
directly or indirectly, to anyone or to use or to allow others to use, for any purpose whatsoever,
any Proprietary Information of any type, whether or not designated confidential or proprietary,

prime Contractor to the City Manager. At a minimum, these materials may be technical papers,

             c.   Statement that the material has been reviewed and approved by officials of

distribution statements will not be accepted or cleared.

        6.     Abstracts or abbreviated materials may be submitted if the intent is to determine
the feasibility of going further in preparing a complete paper for clearance. However, clearance
of abstracts or abbreviated materials does not satisfy the requirement for clearance of the entire
paper.

shall always be used in its originally cleared context and format. Information previously cleared
for public release but containing new, modified or further developed information must be

S.     Insurance.

Contractor shall procure and maintain for the duration of this Contract, and for three (3) years
thereafter, at its sole cost and expense such insurance as will fully protect it and the City and
the City’s council, boards, officials, directors, officers, employees, agents and volunteers from
incidents, accidents and claims for personal injury, bodily injury, and property damage which
may arise from or in connection with the performance of the work and for Contractor’s
professional liability (errors and omissions) under this Contract, whether such services and work
are performed by Contractor, its agents, representatives, employees, or by any subcontractor or
any tier directly employed or retained by either. The following is the minimum insurance and
limits that Contractor must maintain. If Contractor maintains higher limits than the minimums
shown below, the City requires and shall be entitled to coverage for the higher limits maintained
by Contractor. Any available insurance proceeds in excess of the specified minimum limits of
insurance and coverage shall be available to the City.

Contractor shall not commence work under this Contract or continue performance of the
Services unless and until Contractor has obtained and continues to carry all minimum
insurance. Insurance requirements are attached hereto as Exhibit G and incorporated herein by
this reference.

T.     Indemnification.

       1.    Contractor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its officers, agents,
servants and employees from and against any and all liability, suits, actions, damages, losses
and expenses, costs of every nature, including attorneys' fees, arising out of or resulting from
the negligence of Contractor, its employees, or its agents.

         2.  Should the City seek indemnification pursuant to subparagraph (1) above, it shall
give reasonably prompt notice to Contractor of the assertion of any claim or the commencement
of any action, suit, or proceeding (collectively, “action”), in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder and will give Contractor such information with respect thereto as Contractor
may reasonably request in writing. Failure to give reasonably prompt notice hereunder shall not
relieve Contractor of liability pursuant to this subsection; provided, however, should Contractor
prove actual financial loss directly attributable to delayed notice, its financial liability pursuant to
this subsection may be offset by the amount of the direct financial loss proven. Contractor shall,
when directed and at its expense, participate in the defense of any such action involving a third
party; provided, however, the defense shall be conducted with counsel mutually satisfactory to
the City and Contractor. The City and Contractor shall consult with each other regarding the
conduct of such defense. If the defense is assumed by Contractor, Contractor shall submit any
proposed settlement under this section for the City’s approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The City shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate
in the defense thereof, and to employ counsel, at its own expense (except that Contractor shall
pay the fees and expenses of such counsel to the extent the City reasonably concludes that
there is a conflict of interest between the City and Contractor), separate from counsel employed
by Contractor in any such action. Contractor shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the City if Contractor has not assumed the defense thereof. Whether or not
Contractor chooses to defend or prosecute any action involving a third party, all the parties
hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records,
information, and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

          3.   In disputes between the City and Contractor, in no event shall either party be
entitled to or responsible for any special, indirect or consequential damages, whether such
liability arises in breach of contract or warranty, tort including negligence, strict or statutory
liability, or any other cause of action; provided, however, such limitation does not include any
liability for which Contractor is obligated to indemnify the City based upon special, indirect or
consequential damages suffered by third parties.
        4.    The City and Contractor agree that Contractor shall be liable for fines or civil
penalties to a maximum aggregate of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) per year,
which may be imposed by a federal or state department regulatory agency or federal or state
court as a result of Contractor’s negligence. The City will assist Contractor to contest any such
fines or civil penalties in administrative and/or court proceedings prior to any payment by
Contractor. Contractor shall pay the costs of contesting any such fines or civil penalties.
Contractor shall not be liable for fines or civil penalties that result from violations that occurred
prior to the effective date of this Contract or for the effects of prior violations by the City that
have contributed to the assessment of any fine or civil penalty caused by Contractor’s
negligence.

        5.      In determining the amount of any loss, liability, or expense for which the City is
entitled by indemnification under this Contract, the gross amount thereof will be reduced by any
insurance proceeds actually paid to the City under any insurance policies held by the City;
provided, however, that if the City has been indemnified hereunder but does not actually receive
such insurance proceeds until after being indemnified, the City shall reimburse Contractor for
amounts paid to it to the extent of the insurance proceeds are actually received.

       6.     If both Contractor and the City have insurance coverage respecting a particular
claim for which indemnification is provided pursuant to this section, the parties agree that the
insurance coverage of Contractor is the primary coverage and will be called upon before the
insurance coverage of the City is called upon.

        7.    Contractor acknowledges that the obtaining of this Contract is the specific
consideration for this hold harmless and indemnification provision, and further agrees with the
foregoing provisions of indemnity and with the collateral obligation of insuring said indemnity as
set forth herein.

       8.    Nothing in this section shall:

             a.     Limit or prevent the City or Contractor from determining positions and actions
             relative to settlement or defense on any matter for which the City or Contractor are
             responsible; or

             b.     Limit or prevent the City or Contractor from joining the other party or any
             affiliate of a party in any claim, suit, action or proceeding involving a third party
             claim through interpleading, third party claim, cross-claim or otherwise limit or
             prevent a party from voluntarily joining any claim, suit, action or proceeding through
             intervening or as may otherwise be permitted by law or rule.

U.     Non-Discrimination.

During performance of this Contract, Contractor shall not discriminate against any employee or
applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender,
national origin, age, disability, or military or veteran status, or any other status or classification
protected by applicable federal, state and local laws. This practice shall apply to all terms and
conditions of employment, including but not limited to, hiring, placement, promotion, termination,
layoff, recall, transfer, leave of absence, compensation, and training.

Contractor shall undertake equal employment opportunity efforts to ensure that applicants and
employees are treated without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation,
gender, national origin, age, disability, or military or veteran status, or any other status or
classification protected by applicable federal, state and local laws. Contractor's equal
employment opportunity efforts shall include, but not be limited to, all terms and conditions of
employment, including but not limited to, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall,
transfer, leave of absence, compensation, and training.

Contractor shall, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by, or on behalf of
Contractor, state that all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without
regard to their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, national origin, age,
disability, or military or veteran status, or any other status or classification protected by
applicable federal, state and local laws.

Contractor shall cause the foregoing provisions to be inserted in all subcontracts for any work
covered by the Contract so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor,
provided that the foregoing provisions shall not apply to contracts or subcontracts for standard
commercial supplies or raw materials

V.     Assignment.

Contractor shall not assign this Contract or the rights and obligations created herein without the
prior express written consent of the City. Any attempted assignment by Contractor without the
prior express written approval of the City may, at the City’s sole option, result in the termination
of this Contract without any notice to Contractor of such termination.

W.     Points of Contact.

Notwithstanding Contractor’s responsibility for total management during performance of this
Contract, administration of the Contract will require maximum coordination between the City and
Contractor. The following individuals will be the City’s points of contact during performance of
this Contract:

        1.   City Manager. All Contract administration will be effected by the City Manager, and
communication pertaining to Contract administration should be addressed to the City Manager
only. No changes, deviations, or waivers shall be effective without a modification of the Contract
executed by the City Manager or duly authorized representative authorizing such changes,
deviations, or waivers. The City Manager is:

             Name:                     John McDonough
             Telephone Number:         770-730-5600
             E-Mail Address:           jmcdonough@sandyspringsga.gov

       2.   City Manager’s Representative (“CMR”). The City Manager may designate a CMR
at any time during the term of this Contract. Whenever a CMR is designated by the City
Manager, Contractor shall be notified in writing of such designation.

          3.    Failure to Comply with Provisions. As stated in subparagraph 1 above, all
communication pertaining to Contract administration shall be addressed to the City Manager
only. Any communication to City officials other than the City Manager regarding administration
of this Contract including, but not limited to, performance, personnel matters, delivery of
Services, extensions, and Services shall constitute a violation of this Contract. In the event of a
first violation of this section, the City Manager shall notify Contractor within a reasonable time. If,
in Contractor’s opinion, an alleged violation does not in fact constitute a violation, it may dispute
the allegation by notifying the City Manager in writing within two (2) working days after receiving
notice of violation. The matter shall be subject to the Disputes provision in this Contract. A
second violation, subject to notice by Contractor and Contractor’s right to dispute the alleged
second violation, shall constitute a material breach of the provisions of this Contract subject to
the Default provisions of this Contract, pursuant to which the City, in addition to any other
remedies it may have at law or in this Contract, may terminate the Contract.

        4.    Contractor’s Point of Contact. Contractor shall designate to the City Manager an
individual with decision-making authority for Contractor, with current job title, telephone contact,
and email address. Such individual shall act as a single point of contact for Contractor and be
available by telephone or in person at the request of the City Manager on an as-needed basis.

X.     Technical Direction.

        1.    Services to be performed under this Contract are subject to the written Technical
Direction of the City Manager. “Technical Direction,” as used in this section, means a directive
to Contractor that approves approaches, solutions, designs, or refinements; fills in details or
otherwise completes the general description of work or documentation items; shifts emphasis
among work areas or tasks; or furnishes similar instruction to Contractor. Technical Direction
includes requiring studies and pursuit of certain lines of inquiry regarding matters within the
general tasks and requirements of the Scope of Services.

        2.    The City Manager does not have authority to, and shall not, issue any verbal
instruction purporting to be Technical Direction, nor a written Technical Direction, that:

            a.   Constitutes an assignment of additional work outside the Contract Scope of
       Services;

             b.    Constitutes a change as defined in Section Y, Changes;

            c.    Constitutes a basis for any increase or decrease in the total estimated
       Contract cost, the fixed fee (if any), or the time required for Contract performance;

            d.    Changes any of the expressed terms, conditions, or specifications of the
       Contract; or

            e.   Interferes with Contractor’s rights to perform the terms and conditions of the
       Contract.

        3.   All Technical Direction shall be issued in writing by the City Manager, including via
e-mail correspondence.

        4.     Contractor shall proceed promptly, but in any event not later than forty-eight (48)
hours, with the performance of Technical Direction duly issued by the City Manager. If, in
Contractor’s opinion, any instruction or direction by the City Manager falls within any of the
categories defined in paragraph 2 of this section, Contractor shall not proceed but shall notify
the City Manager orally immediately and in writing within two (2) working days after receiving it
and shall request the City Manager to take required corrective action. Upon receiving this
notification, the City Manager shall either issue an appropriate Contract modification within a
reasonable time or advise Contractor in writing within thirty (30) days that the instruction or
direction is:

            a.    Rescinded in its entirety; or

             b.  Within the requirements of the Contract and does not constitute a change
       under Section Y, Changes, and that Contractor should proceed promptly with its
       performance.

        5.    A failure of Contractor and the City Manager to agree that the instruction or
direction is both within the requirements of the Contract and does not constitute a change under
Section Y, Changes, or a failure to agree upon the Contract action to be taken with respect to
the instruction or direction, shall be subject to the Dispute provisions of this Contract.

        6.   Any action(s) taken by Contractor in response to any direction given by any person
other than the City Manager or the CMR shall be at Contractor’s risk.

Y.     Changes.

      1.   General Information. Changes within the general scope of this Contract may be
accomplished after execution of the Contract, and without invalidating the Contract, by written
change order (“Change Order”) or written change directive (“Change Directive”). General scope
changes may include, without limitation, changes in the:

            a.    Description of Services to be performed;
            b.    Time of performance (i.e., hours of the day, days of the week);
            c.    Place of performance of the Services; and/or
            d.    Quantity and/or quality of the Services.

A Change Order shall be based upon agreement between the City and Contractor; a Change
Directive may be issued by the City alone and may or may not have the written agreement of
Contractor.

Changes in the Services shall be performed under applicable provisions of the Contract, and
Contractor shall proceed promptly, unless otherwise provided in the Change Order or Change
Directive.

       2.   Change Order. A Change Order is a written instrument prepared by either party
and signed by the City Manager and Contractor stating their agreement upon all of the following:

            a.    The change to be made to the Contract;

           b.    The amount of the adjustment, if any, to the Contract amount (“Contract
       Amount”); and

            c.    The amount of the adjustment, if any, in the Contract term (“Contract Time”).

        3.    Change Directive. A Change Directive is a written order prepared and signed by
the City Manager directing a change in the Contract prior to agreement on adjustment, if any, in
the Contract Amount or Contract Time, or both. The City Manager may by Change Directive,
without invalidating the Contract, order changes in the Contract within the general scope of the
Contract consisting of additions, deletions or other revisions, with the Contract Amount and
Contract Time being adjusted accordingly.

            a.   A Change Directive may be issued by the City Manager at any time in the
       absence of a written agreement with Contractor on the terms of a Change Order.

            b.   Upon receipt of a Change Directive, Contractor shall promptly commence and
       proceed with the prescribed change(s) to the Services involved.

            c.    If the Change Directive provides for an adjustment to the Contract Amount,
       the adjustment shall be based on one of the following methods:

                   i.   A reasonable lump sum including a reasonable fixed fee or percentage
                  fee properly itemized and supported by sufficient substantiating data to permit
                  evaluation;

                  ii.    Unit prices stated in the Contract or as subsequently agreed upon;

                  iii.   Reasonable cost plus a reasonable fixed fee or percentage fee; or

                  iv.    As provided in Section Y.3.e below.

            d.   A Change Directive that is signed by Contractor indicates Contractor’s
       agreement therewith, including adjustment in Contract Amount and Contract Time or the
       method for determining them. Such agreement shall be recorded as a Change Order.

             e.   If Contractor disagrees with the method for adjustment in the Contract
       Amount or Contract Time, or both, set forth in the written Change Directive, Contractor
       shall promptly, but in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours from date of receipt of the
       written Change Directive, give written notice of its disagreement. In such event, the City
       Manager shall determine the adjustment on the basis of reasonable additional costs or
       savings resulting from the Services attributable to the change including, in the case of an
       increase in the Contract Amount, an amount for overhead and profit as set forth in the
       Contract, or if no such amount is set forth in the Contract, a reasonable amount. In such
       case, under Section Y.3.c.iii, Contractor shall keep and present, in such form and
       manner as the City Manager may prescribe, an itemized accounting of costs together
       with appropriate supporting data.

       Failure to provide written notice of disagreement or objection within the proscribed time
       period set forth in this section shall be deemed a waiver of any such disagreement or
       objection.

              f.   Pending final determination of the total cost of a Change Directive to the City,
       Contractor may request payment for Services completed under the Change Directive.
       The City Manager will make an interim determination for purposes of payment for
       Pending final determination of the total cost of a Change Directive to the City, Contractor
       may request payment for Services completed under the Change Directive. The City
       Manager will make an interim determination for purposes of payment for those costs and
       certify for payment the amount that the City Manager determines to be reasonably
       justified. The City Manager’s interim reasonable determination of cost shall adjust the
       Contract Amount on the same basis as a Change Order, subject to the right of either
        party to disagree and assert a Claim in accordance with the Disputes provision of this
        Contract.

             g.     When Contractor agrees with a determination made by the City Manager
        concerning the adjustments in the Contract Amount and Contract Time, or otherwise
        reaches agreement upon the adjustments, such agreement shall be effective
        immediately and the City Manager will prepare a Change Order. Change Orders may be
        issued for all or any part of a Change Directive.

             h.    Any disputes arising from adjustments made pursuant to Section Y.3.e shall
        be resolved pursuant to Section CC, Disputes; however, nothing in this section shall
        excuse Contractor from proceeding with the performance of work under the Change
        Directive pending resolution of the dispute.

              i.    No Services for which an additional cost or fee will be charged by Contractor
        shall be furnished without prior written authorization of the City Manager.

              j.   If Contractor’s assertion of its right to an adjustment includes the cost of
        Property made obsolete or excess by the change, the City Manager shall have the right
        to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the Property.

Z.      Notices.

All notices or other communications required or permitted to be given under this Contract shall
be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally in hand,
or when mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested with proper postage
prepaid, addressed to the appropriate party at the following address or such other address as

AA.     Governing Law and Consent to Jurisdiction.

This Contract is made and entered into in the State of Georgia and this Contract and the rights
and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed according to the laws
of the State of Georgia without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws. The Courts in
Fulton County, Georgia shall have jurisdiction over any litigation arising out of this Contract.

BB.     Waiver of Breach.
The waiver by either party of a breach or violation of any provision of this Contract shall not
operate or be construed to constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or violation of the
same or other provision thereof.

CC.    Disputes.

Except as otherwise provided herein, all disputes arising under or relating to this Contract shall
be resolved under the provisions of this section.

        1.      “Claim,” as used in this section, means a written demand or written assertion by a
contracting party seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the
adjustment or interpretation of Contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this
Contract. A written demand or written assertion by Contractor must be accompanied by
supporting documentation and verified by Contractor’s designated representative. A voucher,
invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a
Claim; however, the same may be converted to a Claim by complying with the provisions of this
section, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.

             a.   A Claim by Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated
       in this Contract, submitted within thirty (30) days after accrual of the Claim to the City
       Manager for a written decision. A Claim by the City against Contractor shall be subject to
       a written decision by the City Manager. Failure to submit any such written Claim within
       the prescribed time period set forth in this section shall be deemed to be a waiver of
       such Claim.

             b.    Verification

                    i.   Contractor shall provide the verification specified in paragraph (1) of this
                   section when submitting any Claim.

                   ii.   The verification shall be by oath administered by a notary public and
                   shall state as follows: “I swear or affirm that the Claim is made in good faith;
                   that the supporting documentation is accurate and complete to the best of my
                   knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the
                   Contract adjustment for which Contractor believes the City is liable; and that I
                   am duly authorized to certify the Claim on behalf of Contractor.”

        2.   The City Manager shall, within thirty (30) days of receipt of a properly submitted
verified Claim and all necessary supporting documentation and information, decide the Claim
and give Contractor a written statement of the decision.

        3.    The City Manager’s decision shall be final unless Contractor disputes the decision
as set forth below, in which case the parties shall follow the procedures for Alternative Dispute
Resolution.

       4.    Alternate Dispute Resolution. For Contractor to dispute a decision of the City
Manager, Contractor shall file, within fifteen (15) days of the date of the City Manager’s written
decision, a notice in writing of the Claim which is disputed. The parties shall be required to
proceed with alternate dispute resolution by the following procedure.
             a.    Negotiation. The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any Claim
       arising out of or relating to this Contract promptly through negotiations between
       representatives of the parties who have authority to settle the same. The parties shall
       make every effort to meet as soon as reasonably possible at a mutually agreed upon
       time and place and shall attempt to resolve the matter through negotiation within a
       period of thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of claim.

             b.   Mediation. If good faith negotiations have not resulted in a resolution of a
       Claim within the specified time, the parties shall attempt in good faith to settle the Claim
       in an amicable manner through a neutral party by non-binding mediation administered by
       the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Mediation Rules, or a
       mutually acceptable mediator selected by the parties within a period of thirty (30) days
       from date of failure of negotiation.

             c.    Arbitration. If the Claim has not been resolved pursuant to the aforesaid
       mediation procedure within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the notice of claim, or if either
       party fails to participate in a mediation, the Claim shall be resolved exclusively by
       arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its
       Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment upon the award rendered by the
       arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each party shall
       appoint one (1) arbitrator and the appointed arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator who
       shall serve as chairperson of the arbitration panel. The decision of the arbitration panel
       shall be final and binding. Each party shall pay fifty percent (50%) of the third party costs
       of mediation and arbitration.

        5.   Contractor shall not be excused from performance of the Contract, pending final
resolution of any request for relief, Claim, appeal, or action arising under or relating to the
Contract, and shall comply with any decision of the City Manager and the requirements of the
Contract.

       6.     Contractor, by entering into this Contract, does hereby waive its rights to file, or
seek relief, in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction for any Claim of damages or
monetary relief, except as to the enforcement of the decision of the binding arbitration.

DD.    Severability.

If any provision of this Contract is held to be unenforceable for any reason, the unenforceability
thereof shall not affect the remainder of the Contract, which shall remain in full force and effect,
and enforceable in accordance with its terms.

EE.    Entire Agreement.

This Contract contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces any and all prior discussions,
representations and understandings, whether oral or written.

FF.    Headings.

This Contract shall not be interpreted by reference to any of the titles or headings to the
sections or paragraphs of this Contract, which have been inserted for convenience purposes
only and are not deemed a part hereof.
GG.    Interpretation of Exhibits and Exclusion of External References.

The provisions of the main body of this Contract shall govern the relationship between the City
and Contractor. In the event of conflicts or inconsistencies between this Contract and its exhibits
and attachments, including, but not limited to, those provided by Contractor, the provisions of
the main body of this Contract shall control. Website links inserted by Contractor into exhibits or
attachments to this Contract shall not govern, alter, control or otherwise affect the provisions of
this Contract and shall be of no force or effect in the construction or interpretation of this
Contract.

HH.    Copyright, Trademark and Patent Indemnification.

Contractor warrants it has the rights to use and license all products, software and services
provided under this Contract. Contractor further agrees to defend and save harmless the City
against any claims brought by a third party including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees and costs, arising out of or in connection with a claim that the Software, Products and
Services used in the scope of this Contract violated a third party’s trademark, copyright or
patent. Copyright, Trademark and Patent Indemnification shall survive the termination,
cancellation or expiration of this Contract.

II.    Counterparts.

This Contract may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which together shall be
deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

             COMPLIANCE WITH TITLE VI OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964

referred to as the “Regulations”), which are herein incorporated by reference and made a part of
the Contract.

2.       Nondiscrimination: Contractor, with regard to the work performed by it afterward and
prior to completion of the contract work, will not discriminate on the ground of race, color, sex, or
national origin in the selection and retention of subcontracts including procurements of materials
and leases of equipment. Contractor will not participate either directly or indirectly in the
discrimination prohibited by Section 21.5 of the Regulations, including employment practices

potential subcontractor or supplier shall be notified by Contractor of Contractor’s obligations
under this Contract and the Regulations relative to nondiscrimination on the ground of race,
color, national origin or sex.

the Regulations, or orders and instructions issued pursuant thereto, and will permit access to its
books, records, accounts, other sources of information, and its facilities as may be determined
by the Department of Transportation or the Federal Highway Administration to be pertinent to
ascertain compliance with such Regulations, orders and instructions. Where any information
required of a Contractor is in the exclusive possession of another who fails or refuses to furnish
this information, Contractor shall so certify to the Department of Transportation, or the Federal
Highway Administration as appropriate, and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the
information.

5.     Sanctions for Noncompliance: In the event of Contractor’s noncompliance with the
nondiscrimination provisions of this Contract, the Department of Transportation shall impose
such Contract sanctions as it or the Federal Highway Administration may determine to be
appropriate, including, but not limited to:

       (a)   Withholding of payments to Contractors under the Contract until Contractor
             complies, and/or

       (b)   Cancellation, termination or suspension of the Contract, in whole or in part.

through (6) in every subcontract, including procurements of materials and leases of equipment,
unless exempt by the Regulations, orders or instruction issued pursuant thereto. Contractor will
take such action with respect to any subcontract or procurement as the Department of
Transportation or the Federal Highway Administration may direct as a means of enforcing such
provisions including sanctions for noncompliance. Provided, however, that in the event a
Contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or supplier
as result of such direction, Contractor may request the State to enter into such litigation to
protect the interests of the State, and, in addition, Contractor may request the United States to
enter into such litigation to protect the interest of the United States.
