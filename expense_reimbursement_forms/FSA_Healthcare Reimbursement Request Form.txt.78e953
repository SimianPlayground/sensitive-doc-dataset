                                      Documentation Requirements

Documentation for medical expenses required by the IRS includes a third-party receipt containing the following
information:
      Date service was received or purchase made
       Description of service or item purchased
       Dollar amount (after insurance, if applicable)

Documentation for dependent care expenses required by the IRS includes a third party receipt containing the following
information (please be advised if a receipt is unavailable a signature from the provider is sufficient):
      Incurred dates of service
       Dollar amount
       Name of day care provider

Unacceptable forms of documentation include the following:
      Provider statements that only indicate the amount paid, balance forward or previous balance
       Credit card receipts that only reflect a payment
       Bills for prepaid dependent care/medical expenses where services have not yet occurred

When submitting a receipt for a co-payment amount, please be sure the co-payment description is on the receipt. In
some cases, you will need to ask for a receipt at the point of service. If “co-payment” is not clearly identified, have
the provider write “co-payment” on the receipt and sign it.
