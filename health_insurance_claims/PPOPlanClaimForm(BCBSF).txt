 any medical information which they in their judgment deem necessary to the adjudication of this claim.

    false, incomplete or misleading information is guilty of a felony of the third degree. Florida Statutes, Section 817.234.

 situations where such provider(s) is/are non-network provider(s) and Florida law requires direct payment when authorized.

 Florida Blue will honor that assignment from the provider.
