             Work. Therefore, the Offeror is advised to submit any and all information which

              (2) years that would demonstrate the Offeror possesses an understanding of and
              experience in providing the required service. As these references may be checked,
              ensure all information is current and accurate and that prior permission to use is
              obtained from each reference.

              Quality of staff will be an area considered. The firm’s clients’ assessment of the
              quality of staff provided will be an element specifically sought after during reference
              verifications.

              The qualifications of the key design (sub-consultants) and on-site personnel proposed
              by the Offeror to perform the requirements of this solicitation will be considered in the
              evaluation. Therefore, the Offeror should submit detailed information related to the
              experience, technical expertise and qualifications for each key on-site personnel
              proposed, including but not limited to, Overall Project Manager, Design Project

              Provide an organizational chart and narrative, including the team members submitted

              provide the required services.

              Proposals will be evaluated based on the Offeror’s distinctive plan for providing the
              Design Build services. Since the evaluators have already read the Scope of Work for
              the services described, it is not necessary for the Offeror to repeat the exact language,
              or to present a paraphrased version, as an original idea for a technical approach.

              The Offeror may utilize a written narrative or any other printed technique to

DESIGN / BUILD OFFICE SPACE RENOVATION                                         Page 19 of 42
                demonstrate its ability to satisfy the Scope of Work. When appropriate, the narrative
                should describe a logical progression of tasks and efforts starting with the initial steps
                or tasks to be accomplished and continuing until all proposed tasks are fully
                described. The language of the narrative should be straightforward and limited to
                facts, solutions to problems, and plans of proposed action. The usage of technical
                language should be minimized and used only when necessary to describe a technical
                process.

                The additional deliverables to be submitted by the Contractor for evaluation under
                this Section are as follows:

                extension option periods shall be also included in the cost evaluation.

        3.5.4   Additional Information:

                                               EVALUATIONS

5.0      INTRODUCTION

The evaluation of proposals shall be conducted comprehensively, fairly, and impartially.             Structural,
quantitative scoring techniques will be utilized to maximize the objectivity of the evaluation.

5.1.     PROPOSAL EVALUATION COMMITTEE

An evaluation committee will be selected from HHSC to perform all evaluation requirements. The committee
will be composed of individuals with experience in, knowledge of, and program responsibility for the
requirements identified in the RFP. HHSC reserves the right to request information from OFFEROR to
clarify the OFFEROR’S proposal.

5.2      EVALUATION PHASES

Evaluation phases will be conducted as follows:

         Phase 1.....Evaluation of Mandatory Requirements
         Phase 2.....Technical Proposal Evaluation
         Phase 3.....Price Proposal Evaluation
         Phase 4….Determination of Priority List of OFFERORS
         Phase 4.....Proposal Discussions by Priority-List (optional)
         Phase 5.....Best and Final Offers by Priority List (optional)

       5.2.1 PHASE - 1 EVALUATION OF MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS

The evaluation of the mandatory requirements, as listed below, shall be based upon a “Pass/ No Pass” basis.
The purpose of this phase is to determine whether an OFFEROR’S proposal is sufficiently responsible and
responsive to RFP requirements to permit a complete evaluation, i.e. responsible in terms of “Does the
OFFEROR have the capability to perform fully the Scope of Services requirements”; and, “Were proposal
documents, as identified below, received by HHSC and do they contain the required information?” Failure to
meet any mandatory requirement may be grounds for deeming the proposal non-responsible, non-responsive
or both and disqualification (“No Pass”) thereof.

5.4     EVALUATION SCORING SYSTEM

The maximum number of points available for scoring is one hundred (100) per evaluator. The proposal
receiving the highest number of points is considered statistically the best proposal and the best value to
HHSC; and, will be recommended for award of contract, unless otherwise determined and justified by the
evaluation committee.

The evaluation categories are assigned a value weight percentage, as determined by HHSC, totaling 100%.
Each category will be rated between one (1) and ten (10), with ten being the highest (the best rating) by each
member of the evaluation committee. The OFFEROR’S total score (see note below) will be determined by:
a) multiplying the assigned weight value of each category by the numerical rating provided by the evaluation
committee member to determine the score for each category; b) totaling the score for all categories of each
evaluation committee member; and, c) totaling the score of all evaluators.

Note: In determining the total score, the OFFEROR’S price proposal with the lowest price will receive the
highest available rating allocated to price. Each proposal that has a higher price than the lowest will have a
lower rating for price. The points allocated to higher-priced proposals will be equal to the lowest proposal
price multiplied by the maximum points available for price, divided by the higher proposal price.

                                             SPECIAL CONDITIONS


         The GENERAL CONDITIONS are hereby amended with the following:

         1.0     Conflict of Interest: The Offeror shall not undertake any work that represents a
                 potential conflict of interest, or which is not in the best interest of HHSC or the State
                 without prior written approval by HHSC. The Offeror shall fully and completely disclose
                 any situation that may present a conflict of interest. If the Offeror is now performing or
                 elects to perform during the term of this contract any services for any HHSC health plan,
                 provider or contractor or an entity owning or controlling same, the Offeror shall disclose
                 this relationship prior to accepting any assignment involving such party.

         2.0     Contract:

         2.1     The contract between HHSC and the Offeror shall consist of (1) the Request for Proposal
                 (RFP), including any amendments or addendums thereto and the GENERAL
                 CONDITIONS and the SPECIAL CONDITIONS, and (2) the proposal submitted by the
                 Offeror in response to the RFP, including any and all addendums, changes, negotiated
                 agreements, etc. In the event of a conflict in language between the two documents
                 referenced, the provisions and requirements set forth and/or referenced in the RFP shall
                 govern. However, HHSC reserves the right to clarify any contractual relationship in
                 writing, and such written clarification shall govern in case of conflict with the applicable
                 requirements stated in the RFP or the Offeror’s proposal. In all other matters not affected
                 by the written clarification, if any, the RFP shall govern.

         2.2     The contract shall be construed according to the laws of the State of Hawaii. The State of
                 Hawaii is not obligated for the expenditures under the contract until funds have been
                 encumbered.

         3.0     Disclosure of Confidential Information: The Offeror shall not, without prior written
                 approval from the Contracting Officer, either during or after the performance of the
                 services required by this contract, use, other than for such performance, or disclose to any
                 person other than HHSC personnel with a need to know, any information, data, material,
                 or exhibits created, developed, produced, or otherwise obtained during the course of the
                 work required by this contract. This nondisclosure requirement shall also pertain to any
                 information contained in reports, documents, or other records furnished to the Offeror by
                 HHSC.

         4.0     Effective Date: The effective date of this contract shall be the date that the Contracting
                 Officer signs the Offer and Award page of this document unless otherwise stated in this
                 document.
         5.0     Time of Performance: The Contractor shall submit the Progress Schedule with their
                 submitted proposal. The Contractor and HHSC will agree to the Progress Schedule, and
                 the Contractor shall complete all work by the schedule’s completion date. The
                 Agreement’s expiration date will be thirty (30) days from the schedule’s completion date.

         10.0    Priority of Documents: These Special Conditions are attached to the Agreement and
                 incorporated by reference. In the event there is a conflict between the terms of the
