                 EMPLOYEE DIRECT DEPOSIT ENROLLMENT FORM

To enroll in Direct Deposit, simply fill out this form and give it to the Payroll Clerk. Your paycheck may be deposited into any
checking or savings account that you choose, at any bank. Attach a voided check for each Checking Account – not a deposit slip.
