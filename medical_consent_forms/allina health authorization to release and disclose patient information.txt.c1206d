                                              Directions for Completion of Form

    Patient Information: Complete the entire section which identifies clearly and legibly all of the demographic information
    specific to the patient (individual about whom information is being requested)

    Release My Medical Records From: Check the first box if you would like your records released from an Allina Health
    facility/provider. Check the second box if you are requesting your records be released from a non-Allina Health facility/provider.
    When checking the Allina Health option, please specify the specific Allina Health location you are seeking information from.
    Please be specific in your request. For example, United Hospital, St. Paul, MN; Buffalo Hospital, Buffalo, MN; Allina
    Medical Clinic Shoreview, Shoreview, MN. If you do not identify a specific hospital or clinic (e.g. Allina Health), records
    may be provided from ALL Allina Health hospitals or clinics where you have received care. Please see
    allinahealth.org/medical records for a listing of Allina Health hospital and clinic locations and addresses.

    Send My Medical Records To: Identify the full name/business, address, phone and contact information with the name
    of the individual who is to receive the information. Please allow 7-10 days for all requests to be processed and sent to the
    recipient.

    Purpose For Release: Please identify why you need a copy of your record. This helps us to track and assign a priority
    status to your request. It also informs us who may be responsible for the cost of records (where appropriate).

    Information to Be Released: This section gives us the instructions for what information you want released. If you select
    “Clinic Record Set” or “Hospital Record Set”, we will disclose the pertinent documents that are specific to that type of
    patient care visit. This is typically what doctors’ offices, hospitals or other health care providers need to provide
    information related to your care. If you select “any and all” records, your entire record will be provided for a specific visit
    date or all dates. It is very helpful if you identify the date or range of dates, needed by the requestor. Please note record
    types listed in the Special Disclosure Permissions section must be checked in order for them to be released.

    Release Method: This tells us how you would like your information delivered. If you wish to view information prior to
    selection of documents, please identify this on the authorization form and we will contact you to set up a viewing
    appointment. Please note that viewing appointments are done at the Allina Health Corporate Office in Minneapolis. If
    you wish information about you to be shared verbally or for an authorization to be on file for others to have access to your
    medical information, please write this in this section (example: form on file for access by my husband upon his specific
    request). Please note: there are size limitations when emailing records.


    Duration of the authorization, revocation and other information you need to know: This authorization will automatically
    expire in 12 months unless you include a different date. You may indicate the authorization is valid “5 years”, “10 years”,
    but there needs to be an ending date (do not use terms such as “lifetime” or “forever”). The authorization can be revoked
    by your written direction to our organization.
