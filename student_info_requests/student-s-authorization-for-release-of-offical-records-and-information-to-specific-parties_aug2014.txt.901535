        Select Information Related to Disclosures of Student Education Records
         from American University’s Confidentiality of Student Records Policy

American University’s Confidentiality of Student Records policy provides a general framework for the
university’s compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (“FERPA”). Students at
American University have a number of rights regarding their education records; two of these include 1) having
access to their education records and 2) consenting to release a record to a third party. The following
information presents selected sections of the policy that are particularly relevant to student authorization to
release a record to a third party. Please refer to the entire policy in the Student Handbook for complete
information, since this represents an abbreviated version; the policy is available online at
www.american.edu/handbook/confidentiality.html.

Student education records are confidential and may only be released with consent of the student or as otherwise
permitted by law. American University does not maintain education records in one central office. Education
records are maintained in the various departments, schools, or colleges. Examples of academic and non-
academic student education records include without limitation:

        Academic Records: Permanent record of academic performance (e.g., transcript, including
        supporting documents) maintained by the Office of the University Registrar, the WCL Registrar,
        academic advisor, dean’s office, and Provost’s Office; files of academic progress maintained by the
        individual school/college academic office and Provost’s Office; admission files of students; Career
        Center files.

        Non-Academic Records: Files related to Financial Aid, Housing and Dining Programs, International
        Student and Scholar Services, Student Accounts, and the Library; student discipline files; employment
        files of students who are employed because of their student status (e.g. work-study, graduate
        assistantship/fellowship).

Only information directly relevant to the educational processes of the university or which is voluntarily offered
by the student and accepted from the student shall be included in student education records. Specifically
excluded from such student education records are certain medical and mental health information; sole
possession records or private notes; records created and maintained by Public Safety solely for law enforcement
purposes; employment records of students; alumni records.

The university may disclose student education records with the prior written consent of the student. A
student may authorize access to third parties to review the student’s education record by completing a
written and dated authorization form which specifies the information to be released, the reasons for
the release, and to whom the information is to be released.

The university may disclose information in the following circumstances without the prior written consent
of the student (this is a selected list; see the entire policy for a complete list): to the parents of a dependent
student, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code (The parent must sign, and provide to the university, a written
statement confirming that the student is a dependent; the statement must be accompanied by a copy of the
parent’s most current tax return which reports the student as a dependent.); to persons or organizations
providing the student financial aid; to appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency; to appropriate parties
as permitted by the university’s Parental Notification of Disciplinary Violations Involving the Use or Possession
of Alcohol or a Controlled Substance; and to appropriate parties in other circumstances as required by law.

Education records will only be disclosed to third parties if they are advised not to redisclose the
information to others without the prior written consent of the student or as permitted by law.
