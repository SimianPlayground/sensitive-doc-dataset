                                    Fee Disclosure and Compensation Agreement                OMB Control No. 3245-0201
                                           For use with 7(a) and 504 Loan Programs            Expiration Date: 08/31/2021

Purpose of this form: The purpose of this form is to identify Agents and the fees and/or compensation paid to Agents by
or on behalf of a small business applicant (“Applicant”) for the purpose of obtaining or expediting an application for a
loan guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). This is a statutory requirement under 15 U.S.C. 642.
See 13 CFR Parts 103 and 120 and SBA’s Standard Operating Procedure 50 10 for the rules governing compensation of
Agents or SBA Lenders in connection with an SBA loan.
Who must complete this form?: This form must be completed and signed by the SBA Lender and the Applicant whenever
an Agent is paid by either the Applicant or the SBA Lender in connection with the SBA loan application. Each Agent paid
by the Applicant to assist it in connection with its application must also complete and sign the form. When an Agent is
paid by the SBA Lender, the SBA Lender must complete this form and the SBA Lender and Applicant must both sign the
form. The SBA Lender must inform the Applicant in writing that the Applicant is not required to employ an Agent or
representative (including the SBA Lender) to assist the Applicant with the SBA loan application.
Compensation must be disclosed on this form for the following services:
    1. Loan packaging services, as defined in SOP 50 10, performed by an SBA Lender or other third party (This
        includes services performed by an individual/entity that is a Lender Service Provider (LSP) (7(a) only) or has an
        SBA-approved Professional Services Contract (504 only) with the SBA Lender who is acting as a loan packager
        or referral agent employed by the Applicant);
    2. Financial statement preparation specifically for the loan application; and/or
    3. Consulting, Broker, or Referral services paid by the Applicant, SBA Lender, or Third Party Lender (504 only).
Fees paid to the following individuals for their services in connection with the SBA loan application are not required to be
disclosed on this form:
    1. Applicant’s accountant performing services in the normal course of business;
    2. Any attorney in connection with the 7(a) or 504 loan closing;
    3. A state-certified or state-licensed appraiser employed by the SBA Lender to appraise collateral;
    4. An LSP performing services for the Lender under an SBA-reviewed LSP agreement (7(a) only) or an individual
       performing services for the CDC under an SBA-approved professional services contract (504 only);
    5. An individual employed by the SBA Lender to perform a business valuation in connection with the SBA loan;
    6. An environmental professional employed by the SBA Lender to conduct an environmental assessment of the
       collateral; and/or
    7. A real estate agent who is receiving a commission for the sale of real estate.

Instructions for completing this form: The Agent must be identified, all services provided must be listed, and the party
paying the fee and amount paid must also be disclosed (and itemized, when required). The SBA Lender must ensure that
the Agent performing services is not debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily
excluded from participation in this transaction by any Federal department or Agency. (See www.sam.gov.) The SBA does
not allow contingency fees (fees paid only if the loan is approved) or charges for services which are not reasonably
necessary in connection with an application. A separate form is required for each Agent (including an SBA Lender when
the SBA Lender performs packaging services) that has or will receive compensation as part of the transaction. However,
all of the services provided by the same Agent may be listed on a single form.
If the compensation paid exceeds $2,500, the Agent must provide supporting documents that include: 1) a detailed
explanation of the work performed; and 2) the hourly rate(s) and the number of hours spent working on each activity. The
SBA Lender must ensure that the supporting documents are attached to this form. When a single provider charges an
Applicant in connection with multiple applications, fees are aggregated to establish the $2,500 threshold for requiring
supporting documents and a detailed explanation. Supporting documents and a detailed explanation are required even if
the compensation is charged on a percentage basis.
All SBA Lenders must retain the original Form 159 in the loan file. 7(a) Lenders must submit a copy of each completed
Form 159 to Fiscal Transfer Agent only once after there has been an initial disbursement on the loan in conjunction with
its monthly 1502 report. CDCs must submit a copy of each completed Form 159 to SBA in its Annual Report for all of the
504 loans closed during the fiscal year being reported.
