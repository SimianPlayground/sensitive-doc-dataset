Subject:          County Purchasing New Vendor/Bid System & Online Vendor Registration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Purchasing Department has implemented its new bid processing vendor
notification/registration system. The new system will allow vendors to register and
maintain their vendor file in real time without the intervention of the Purchasing
Department. Vendors will maintain their address information and contact information; as
well as the commodity information that the vendor wants to be considered for on County
bid solicitations. Vendors will be given a choice of receiving hard copy bid notifications,
or electronic notifications to the vendors designated email and/or cellular telephone text
number. We hope that the changes will help our vendors receive their solicitations in a
more effective and efficient manner that will benefit both the County and the vendor with
more timely, accurate, competitive bids.

All vendors wishing to receive or continue to receive bid notifications must register in this
new system at www.epcounty.com. /Bids & More/Vendors List. Thank you for your
cooperation. If you have any questions please contact us at (915)546-2048.

    from positive pay.

12. Checks, Deposit Tickets, Endorsement Stamps, and Other Supplies - The Bank will
    order supplies for the County as specified by the County. Any applicable charges

    at the time the account is opened. Bank must send monthly account activity

19. Overdrafts - All demand deposit overdrafts incurred in the normal course of business
    will be covered at no cost to the County as long as sufficient compensating balances
    exist in other County accounts.

20. Safekeeping Account - In the event the County exercises its right to make external
    investments, the depository institution must provide a safekeeping account to
    hold securities purchased by the County. If the depository bank cannot provide
    investment safekeeping services, then the County will also have to select a second
    depository for those safekeeping services. Excess funds are invested in accordance
    with the County’s investment policy and the Public Funds Investment Act. All
    investments are on “delivery versus payment” where the safekeeping entity verifies
    the incoming security to the purchase instructions provided by the County. If the
    security matches the purchase instructions the safekeeping entity releases the funds
    to purchase the security. If the safekeeping entity is not the County’s main
    depository bank, then funds would need to be transferred to the into the safekeeping
    account the day before the security delivery date. Any cash funds in the safekeeping
    account would either have to be collateralized at 102% per the County’s depository
    collateral requirements or swept into an interest earning money market account. The
    safekeeping entity will provide transaction notices for any interest payments
    received on investments, investments maturing, sold or purchased, and monthly
    safekeeping account statements. The report shall contain security descriptions, par
    value/current face and current market value as well as any interest earned on funds
    in the account.

Safekeeping Account Requirements:

      Chapter 176 of the Texas Local Government Code requires that any vendor or person
      considering doing business with a local government entity make certain disclosures. In
      2015, the Texas Legislature updated the law and the Texas Ethics Commission made

      vendor must disclose any covered affiliation or business relationship with County

      questionnaire must be filed with the County of El Paso County, Texas. If no conflict of

      convenience, a blank CIQ Form is enclosed with this bid/proposal. Blank CIQ Forms
      may also be obtained by visiting the Purchasing Department website at:
      http://epcounty.com/purchasing/bids/default.htm

      2016 and after, the awarded vendor must submit to the County a completed “Certificate
      of Interested Parties” form, which will be included in the Commissioners Court agenda at

      awarding the contract of anyone interested in the proposed contract, that all statements

      indirectly, submitted his or her bid/proposal price or any breakdown thereof, or the
