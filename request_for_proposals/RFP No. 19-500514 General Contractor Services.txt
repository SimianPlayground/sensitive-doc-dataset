             under this agreement shall first either be certified by the manufacturer to
             be asbestos free or to be inspected by accredited parties and certified to be
             free of asbestos content in accordance with EPA, AHERA and 1982
             School Rules. Contractor shall furnish the County with an affidavit to the
             above criteria.

             regarding the status of any existing hazardous materials known to be
             present in the areas affected by the work. The County will perform
             necessary abatement to hazardous materials prior to the contractor
             performing the work in those work areas.
          • If the contractor suspects that hazardous materials may exist in areas of
             work not previously discovered by the County, the contractor shall cease
             work immediately in the area of the suspect materials and contact the the

11. Inspections. Contractor is responsible for furnishing all materials, labor and services
    for all work in accordance with the contract documents. Any inspection of the work

   obligation of the contractor does not relieve the contractor from fulfilling his
    responsibilities under the contract documents. A contractor’s representative shall
    attend the final inspection. A walk-thru with appropriate County personnel must
   occur and be approved for project completion and acceptance.

      SCHEDULE OF LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PARTICIPATION
                     OPPORTUNITY TRACKING FORM

The Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Commissioners of DeKalb County believe that it is
important to encourage the participation of small and local businesses in the continuing business of
County government; and that the participation of these types of businesses in procurement will
strengthen the overall economic fabric of DeKalb County, contribute to the County’s economy and tax
base, and provide employment to local residents. Therefore, the Chief Executive Officer and the Board
of Commissioners have made the success of local small businesses a permanent goal of DeKalb County
by implementing the DeKalb First Local Small Business Enterprise Ordinance.

     PROVISIONS OF DEKALB FIRST LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (LSBE)
                                 ORDINANCE

                              Percentage of LSBE Participation Required

                  LSBE Within DeKalb (LSBE-                Ten (10) Preference
                  DeKalb)                                  Points
                  LSBE Outside DeKalb (LSBE-               Five (5) Preference Points
                  MSA)
                  Demonstrated GFE                         Two (2) Preference Points

Certified Local Small Business Enterprises (LSBEs) located within DeKalb County and prime
contractors utilizing LSBEs that are locally-based inside DeKalb County shall receive ten (10) points
in the initial evaluation of their response to any Request for Proposal. Certified LSBEs located outside
of DeKalb County but within the nine (9) County Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) consisting of
Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale Counties shall
receive five (5) points in the initial evaluation of their response to any Request for Proposal. Prime
Contractors who demonstrate sufficient good faith efforts in accordance with the requirements of the
ordinance shall be granted two (2) points in their initial evaluation of responses to any Request for
Proposal. Pro-rated points shall be granted where a mixture of LSBE-DeKalb and LSBE MSA firms
are utilized. Utilization of each firm shall be based upon the terms of the qualified sealed solicitation.

Prime Contractor(s) deemed responsible and remains responsive to an Invitation to Bid (ITB) because
they are either a certified LSBE-DeKalb or LSBE-MSA firm or has obtained 20% participation of an
LSBE-DeKalb or LSBE-MSA firm, submits the lowest bid price shall be deemed the lowest, responsive
and responsible bidder.

Prime Contractor(s) deemed responsible and remains responsive to an Invitation to Bid (ITB) and
documented good faith efforts, submits a lower bid price than a Prime Contractor that achieved 20%
LSBE participation, or otherwise required benchmark, then the Prime Contractor who actually met the



                                                   22
benchmark will be given the opportunity to match the lowest bid price of the Prime Contractor who
only made good faith efforts. Prime Contractor(s) who choose not to match the lowest bid price, then
the Prime Contractor who made the good faith efforts will be deemed the lowest, responsive and
responsible bidder.

For all qualified sealed solicitations, the Director of Purchasing and Contracting, DeKalb County
Government, shall determine if the bidder/proposer has included written documentation showing that
at least twenty percent (20%) of the total contract award will be performed by a certified LSBE. This
written documentation shall be in the form of a notarized Schedule of LSBE Participation (Attached
hereto as “Exhibit A”.) For all contracts, a signed letter of intent from all certified LSBEs describing
the work, material, equipment and/or services to be performed or provided by the LSBE(s) and the
agreed upon percentage shall be due with the bid or proposal documents and included with “Exhibit A”.
The certified vendor list establishes the group of Certified LSBE’s from which the bidder/proposer must
solicit subcontractors for LSBE participation. This list can be found on our website
http://www.dekalbcountyga.gov/purchasing-contracting/about-purchasing-and-contracting or obtained
from the Special Projects LSBE Program team.

Prime Contractors failing to meet the LSBE benchmark must document and demonstrate Good Faith
Efforts in accordance with the attached “Checklist for Good Faith Efforts” portion of “Exhibit A.” The
notarized Schedule of LSBE Participation shall be due and submitted with each bid or proposal. Failure
to achieve the LSBE benchmark or demonstrate good faith efforts shall result in a bid or proposal being
rejected. Prime Contractors that fail to attend the mandatory LSBE meeting in person or via video
conference shall mean that the Prime Contractor has not demonstrated sufficient good faith efforts and
its bid or proposal if submitted, shall be deemed non-responsive without any further review.

Upon award, Prime Contractors are required to submit a report detailing LSBE Sub-Contractor usage
with each request for payment and not less than on a monthly basis. Prime Contractors shall ensure that
all LSBE sub-contractors have been paid within seven (7) days of the Prime’s receipt of payment from
the County. Failure to provide requested reports/documentation shall constitute a material breach of
contract, entitling the County to terminate the Contract for default or pursue other remedies. LSBE sub-
contractors must confirm payments received from the Prime(s) for each County contract they participate
in.

For eligible bids/proposals valued over $5,000,000.00, the Mentor-Protégé provision of the Ordinance
shall apply. Prime Contractors must agree to become mentors and take on an LSBE protégé in an effort
to enhance the potential of future LSBEs. Qualifying projects shall be performed by both Mentor and
Protégé through a subcontract between both parties. This requirement is in addition to all other
applicable sections of the DeKalb First Ordinance. Please review the ordinance, section 2-214 or contact
the LSBE Program Representative for detailed information regarding this initiative.

                                   subcontracted and the corresponding reasons for not including them.
                                   The ability or desire of a bidder/proposer to perform the contract work
                                   with its own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to
                                   make good faith efforts on all scopes of work subject to subcontracting.

                                   Where feasible, facilitating the leasing of supplies or equipment when
                                   they are of such a specialized nature that the LSBE could not readily
                                   and economically obtain them in the marketplace.

     program carried by the County.
                                                O


F.   If the Contractor is a joint venture involving two (2) or more entities, then each independent
                                                     N


     entity will satisfy the limits and coverages specified here or the joint venture will be a named

     County and its officers and shall cause each Subcontractor to waive all rights of subrogation
     for all coverage.

I.   Failure of the County to demand such certificate or other evidence of full compliance with
     these insurance requirements or failure of the County to identify a deficiency from evidence
     provided will not be construed as a waiver of the Contractor’s obligation to maintain such
     coverage.

         conditions, the Contractor shall submit detailed drawings and written notification

         the Contractor and the County, that the time for the completion of the Work
         described herein is a reasonable time for the completion of the same, taking into
         consideration the average climate range and usual industrial conditions prevailing
         in this locality.

    C.   If extraordinary adverse weather conditions are the basis for a claim for additional
         time, such claim shall be supported by the attachment of records of the National
         Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showing meaningful variances from
         historic trends thereby substantiating the fact that weather conditions were
         abnormal for the period of time, could not have been reasonably anticipated and
         had an adverse effect on the scheduled construction activities. The Contractor shall
         be entitled to an extension of the Contract Time only for extraordinary adverse
         weather conditions that unavoidably delay activities scheduled at that time, and



                                          A-5

          adverse weather conditions. The Contractor is not entitled to any costs associated
          with extraordinary adverse weather conditions.

     D.   The County shall not be liable to the Contractor or any Subcontractor for claims or
          damages of any nature caused by or arising out of delays, regardless of cause. The
          sole remedy against the County for delays shall be the allowance of additional time
          for completion of the Work, the amount of which shall be based on actual and
          unavoidable delay.


GR-7. SCHEDULES, REPORTS, AND RECORDS

     A.   The Contractor shall submit to the County such schedule of quantities and costs,
          SA

           progressed or reached the level of completion required by the Contract, the County
           will have the right to order the Contractor to take corrective measures necessary to
           expedite the progress of construction, including, without limitation, (1) working
           additional shifts or overtime; (2) supplying additional manpower, equipment, and
           facilities; and (3) other similar measures (hereinafter referred to collectively as

    B.     Termination for Default. If the Contractor is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or if
           he makes a general assignment for the benefit of his creditors, or if a trustee or
           receiver is appointed for the Contractor or for any of his property, or if he files a

           materials or equipment, make payments to Subcontractors or for labor, materials or

           public body having jurisdiction of the Work, or if he otherwise violates any
           provision of the Contract, then the County may, without prejudice to any other right
           or remedy, and after giving the Contractor and his surety a maximum of seven (7)
           days from delivery of a written notice, declare the Contract in default and terminate
           this Contract. In that event, the County may take possession of the Project and of
           all materials, equipment, tools, construction equipment and machinery thereon
           owned by the Contractor. The County may cause the Work to be completed and
           corrected by whatever method it deems expedient. If called upon by the County to
           finish the Work, the Contractor’s surety shall promptly do so. In any case, the

              without limitation all costs of completion or correction of the Work, liquidated
              damages, attorneys’ fees, expert fees, and other costs of dispute resolution.
              Termination of this Contract pursuant to this paragraph may result in
              disqualification of the Contractor from bidding on future County contracts for a
              period of time not to exceed five (5) years.

       C.     If Contractor’s services are terminated by the County pursuant to paragraph A or B
              in this General Requirement, the termination will not affect any rights or remedies
              of the County then existing or which may thereafter accrue against Contractor or
              its surety. Any retention or payment of moneys due Contractor by County will not
              release Contractor from liability. If it is determined that the Contractor was not in
              default or that the failure to perform is excusable, a termination for default will be
               SA

              considered to have been a termination for the convenience of the County, and the
              rights and obligations of the parties shall be governed accordingly.

       A.     The Contractor warrants to the County that materials and equipment furnished
              under the Contract will be new and of good quality, unless otherwise required or

     including substitutions not properly approved and authorized, is considered
     defective. The County, in its sole discretion, may exclude from the Contractor's
     warranty; remedies for damage or defect which the County determines were caused
     by abuse; modifications not executed by the Contractor; improper or insufficient
     maintenance; improper operation; and normal wear and tear and normal usage.

     Contractor shall guarantee in writing that all Work has been accomplished in
     conformance with the Contract. If required by the County, the Contractor shall also
     furnish additional satisfactory evidence as to the kind and quality of materials and

     written demand from the County, remedy any error, omission, defect, or non-
     compliance in the Work discovered by the County during construction or at any
     time thereafter until one year after the final completion of the Work. Nothing herein
             M

     to any legal action by the County against the Contractor.

D.   Contractor shall pay for any damage caused by any omission or defect in the Work,

     the event that the Contractor should fail to timely make repairs, adjustments, or
                               C


     other remedy that may be made necessary by such defects, the County may do so,

     Completion for a period of one (1) year after the actual performance of the Work.
     If any defect or deviation should exist, develop, be discovered or appear within
     such one (1) year period, the Contractor, at it sole cost and expense and immediately

     upon demand, shall fully and completely repair, correct, and eliminate such defect.
     The foregoing warranties and guarantees are cumulative of and in addition to, and
     not restrictive of or in lieu of, any and all other warranties and guarantees provided
     for or required by law. No one or more of the warranties contained herein shall be
     deemed to alter or limit any other. The Performance Bond shall remain in full force
     and effect throughout the applicable guarantee period set forth in this paragraph.

F.   Neither the final payment nor any provision of the Contract, nor partial or entire
     occupancy or use of the Work by the County, shall constitute an acceptance of any
     part of the Work that is not in accordance with the Contract or relieve the Contractor
     of liability for incomplete or faulty materials or workmanship.

            manufacturers regarding their performance, quality of workmanship or quality of

            assignable to the County, and that upon final completion of the Work, all such
            guarantees, warranties and agreements shall be in place and enforceable by the
            County in accordance with their terms. Contractor’s obligations pursuant to this
            General Requirement shall survive any acceptance of Work, or termination or
            expiration of this Contract.

E.   The County’s review will be within reasonable promptness as to cause no delay in
     the Work. Approval of the Contractor’s Submittals does not relieve the Contractor
                  PL


     of any responsibility for accuracy of dimensions and details or from otherwise
     ensuring that the Work complies with the requirements of the Contract. It is
                         E


     mutually agreed that the Contractor shall be responsible for agreement and
     conformity of Submittals with the Drawings and Specifications. The County will

     review and approve or take other appropriate action upon the Contractor's
     Submittals such as shop drawings, product data and samples, but only for the

     dimensions and quantities, or for substantiating instructions for installation or
     performance of equipment or systems, all of which remain the responsibility of the
     Contractor as required by the Contract. The County’s review shall not constitute
                                                   AC


     approval of safety precautions or of any construction means, methods, techniques,
     sequences or procedures. The County’s approval of a specific item shall not

     indicate approval of an assembly of which the item is a component.

D.   It is the responsibility of the Contractor to check all Submittals before same are
     submitted to the County for approval. Submittals which have not been checked and
     approved by the Contractor will not be reviewed by the County.

E.   Submittals shall be submitted only by the Contractor who shall indicate by a signed
     stamp on the drawings that he has checked the Submittals and that the work shown
     on them is in accordance with Contract requirements and has been checked for
     dimensions and relationship with work of all other trades involved. Under no
     conditions shall Submittals be accepted from anyone other than the Contractor.

               for approval. Two finally approved copies will be returned to the Contractor for
               his use. The Contract Price shall include the cost of furnishing all Submittals and
               the Contractor will be allowed no extra compensation for such drawings.

       G.      The approval of such Submittals shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility
               for deviations from Drawings or the Specifications unless he has in writing called
               attention to such deviations, and the County has approved the changes or deviations
               in writing at the time of submission, nor shall it relieve him from the responsibility
               for errors of any kind in Submittals. When the Contractor does call such deviations
               to the attention of the County, he shall state in writing whether or not such
               deviations involve any extra cost. If this is not mentioned, it will be assumed that
               no extra cost is involved for making the change.

              authorized representatives of the County and public authorities having jurisdiction
              in connection with the Work of this Contract. The presence or observations of the
              County or its representative at the site of the Work shall not be construed to, in any
              manner, to relieve the Contractor of its responsibility for strict compliance with the

              inspection or approval beyond the requirements of the Specifications, the County
              will instruct the Contractor to make arrangements for such additional testing,

              except as provided below, shall be at the County’s expense.

       E.     If such procedures for testing or inspection reveal failure of the portions of the
              Work to comply with requirements established by the Contract, all costs made

              Contractor's expense.

    5.      In the event a Claimant files a claim against the County, or the property of the County, and the
            Principal fails or refuses to satisfy or discharge it promptly, the Surety shall satisfy or discharge

    10.     This Bond is intended to comply with O.C.G.A. §36-91-90, and shall be interpreted so as to
            comply with the minimum requirements thereof. However, in the event the express language of
