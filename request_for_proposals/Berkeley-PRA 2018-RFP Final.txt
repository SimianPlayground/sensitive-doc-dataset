Dear Proposer:

The City of Berkeley is soliciting written proposals from qualified firms or individuals for a Public Records Act

 The project scope, content of proposal, and vendor selection process are summarized in the RFP (attached).
 Proposals must be received no later than 2:00 pm, on December 13, 2018. All responses must be in a sealed
envelope and have “Public Records Act Request Software” and Specification No. 19-11255-C clearly marked
on the outer most mailing envelope. Please submit one (1) unbound original and four (4)) unbound copies of
                                           the proposal as follows:

                                            Mail or Hand Deliver To:

Proposals will not be accepted after the date and time stated above. Incomplete proposal or proposals that do not
conform to the requirements specified herein will not be considered. Issuance of the RFP does not obligate the City
to award a contract, nor is the City liable for any costs incurred by the proposer in the preparation and submittal of
proposals for the subject work. The City retains the right to award all or parts of this contract to several bidders, to
not select any bidders, and/or to re-solicit proposals. The act of submitting a proposal is a declaration that the
proposer has read the RFP and understands all the requirements and conditions.

I.    INTRODUCTION

The City of Berkeley (“City) is soliciting proposals from qualified companies to provide a comprehensive,
all-in-one platform for managing Public Records Act (“PRA”) requests and complying with open
government transparency. This RFP is for Hosted, Commercial Off-The-Shelf (“COTS”) system, including
but not limited to configuration, data migration and training services.

1.1      About the City

The City of Berkeley is located in Alameda County on the east side of the San Francisco Bay. At the
geographic midpoint of the greater San Francisco Bay Area, the City is 20 minutes (or 10 miles away) from
San Francisco and within easy proximity to population centers in Contra Costa County and Silicon Valley.
Encompassing 17.7 square miles and with a population of approximately 118,853 residents, Berkeley has the
highest population density of any city in the East Bay region. The City is defined to a large degree, both
culturally and economically, by the presence of the University of California campus located on the eastern
side of the City.

The City operates under its own charter with a Council/Manager form of government. The City Council
consists of eight Councilmembers, elected by City’s for four-year terms, and one Mayor, and elected "at
large" for a four-year term. The City provides a comprehensive set of community services common to
similar-sized California cities such as public safety (police and fire); sanitation and sewer; public
maintenance and infrastructure; leisure (parks, recreation and marina); animal control; planning and zoning;
general and administrative services, and housing advocacy and support services. In addition, the City offers
support services for public health and human services; and operates a city-owned public library system.

The Mayor and Council select and confirm the City Manager, who acts as a Chief Executive Officer for the
rest of the City government. The City Manager is responsible for the administration of City services and
programs, enforcement of the City's Municipal Code and ordinances, and preparation of the annual budget.
Department directors are selected by the City Manager and confirmed by the City Council.

The City employs a two-year budget process. In year one of the biennial budget cycle, the City Council
formally adopts authorized appropriations for the first year of the two-year budget and approves “planned”
appropriations for the second fiscal year. In year two of the budget cycle, the City Council considers
revisions and formally adopts authorized appropriations for the second fiscal year. Although the budget cycle
covers a two-year period, the City Charter requires that the City Council adopt an annual appropriations
ordinance for each budget year.

The City’s fiscal year 2019 budget extending from July 1, 2018 through to June 30, 2019 is $474 million, of
which $171 million is allocated from the General Fund. The City has a workforce of 1,530 full-time
equivalent employees.

City of Berkeley                            Specification No. 19-11255-C                            Page 6 of 53
Public Records Act (PRA) Request Software                                               Release Date 11/14/2018

1.2       Project Background

 The the City of Berkeley (the “City”) seeks to replace its current software used to process PRA requests.
 Currently a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software system, (Lagan/Verint) is used to record,
 store history and report on PRA requests. As part of an overall assessment of its systems and processes the
 City determined that a new PRA software system will improve public access to information, increase
 internal operational efficiencies and provide the ability for the public to easily search on-line for public
 information. The CRM system provides limited flexibility, no online redaction, and no integration with
 outlook email and does not allow community members on-line web access to look up PRA requests or
 history.

 The City Council’s 2018-2019 Strategic Plan includes “Be a customer-focused organization that provides
 excellent, timely, easily-accessible service and information to the community.” A new web based PRA
 software solution will support the City’s Strategic Plan.

1.3       Project Goals

 The limited installed functionality, lack of workflow and reporting capabilities of the current system used to
 process PRA’s require many manual work hours to complete a request. With this Project, the City’s goal is
 to provide an organization-wide, web-based system for receiving, acknowledging, processing, tracking and
 responding to public records request.

 The Project’s key goals and success indicators include the following:
      •   Improvement to business processes
      •   Improvements to and updating of outdated technology
      •   Improved administration and management of public records request
      •   Implement searchable public-facing and internal employee-facing platform that is available 24 hours
          a day, 7 days a week
      •   Improvement to workflow
      •   Elimination of duplicate public records requests
      •   Implement auto-redactions tools
      •   Provide access to source data and user-friendly reporting tools
      •   Improved productivity and transparency
      •   Reduce paper use

1.4       Notice to Vendors

Failure to carefully read and understand this RFP may cause the Proposal to be out of compliance, rejected by
the City, or legally obligate the Vendor to more than intended. Information obtained by the Vendor from any
officer, agent or employee of the City shall not affect the risks or obligations assumed by the Vendor or relieve
the Vendor from fulfilling any of the RFP conditions or any subsequent contract conditions. Attempts by or on
behalf of a prospective or existing vendor to contact or to influence any member of the selection committee,
any member of the City Council, or any employee of the City with regard to the acceptance of a Proposal may
lead to elimination of that Vendor from further consideration. Only the format described in the City’s RFP and
the attachments included with this RFP will be accepted as compliant for the submitted proposal. Failure to
completely fill out all required attachments may result in disqualification.

1.5       Solicitation Schedule

The City has developed a tentative schedule for procurement process activities and reserved corresponding
times on staff calendars.

1.6       Project Elements

1.6.1     General Conditions

      a) In the event that all RFP requirements are not met with products and services provided by one firm,
         Vendors are encouraged to partner with another firm to submit a joint proposal. Failure to meet all
         requirements will not disqualify a firm. However, the City will evaluate each proposal to determine
         its overall fit in the best interests of the City.
      b) In the event that multiple firms partner to submit a joint proposal, the Proposal must identify one
         firm as the primary contact and sole contracting party. This primary contact will be the City’s
         primary point of contact throughout the procurement process and will assume sole responsibility for
         the entire scope of services to be performed by all partners included in a joint proposal. In addition,
         the contracting firm agrees to ensure that all partnering firms comply with the City’s contracting
         terms and conditions.
      c) All third-party solutions proposed as part of a joint proposal are subject to the same requirements of
         this RFP, unless otherwise stated.
      d) Implementation pricing must be submitted on a “milestone” basis. For implementation services
         under a milestone arrangement, the City compensates the Vendor a fixed amount upon the
         completion and acceptance of major milestones; consequently, Vendors are to provide all work effort
         and assumptions used to calculate a fixed fee for each milestone. The scope of the project will be
         defined by the statement of work and requirements included as Attachment 4: PRA Business Process
         Functional & Technical Requirements, Attachment 5: Report Requirements, Attachment 6: Interface
         Requirements, and Attachment 7: Data Conversion Requirements.
      e) All firms submitting proposals are encouraged to submit the most competitive proposal possible –
         the failure to do so may lead to elimination prior to software demonstrations.
      f) This RFP, its general provisions, and the terms and conditions identified in Section VII
         (CONTRACT CONDITIONS FOR PROJECT) shall be incorporated in any agreement resulting
         from this solicitation, and the RFP and its terms and conditions, plus attachments shall control unless
         the Agreement expressly provides otherwise.
      g) All Proposals and any subsequent clarification or response to the City’s questions shall be valid for a
         minimum of 180 days.

II.       SCOPE OF WORK

The City desires a Software as a Service (SaaS), Cloud-hosted solution to enable members of the public to
submit public records request through a web-based portal. The Web-based cloud-hosted solution will have
flexibility, security and self-service capability to meet current and future public records governance. Vendors
should prepare their proposals based on addressing the business function that are listed in Section III
BUSINESS, FUNCTIONAL & TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. The City reserves the right to negotiate
changes (including additions and deletions) to this list of functionalities as the scope and cost of the project
evolves.

It is the City’s intent to adopt industry best practices and standards wherever feasible in order to minimize the
customization and configuration that is required to implement and maintain the various components of the
proposed Public Records Act request software solution. Vendor selected as a result of this RFP must be
prepared to begin work immediately upon contract execution.

          The City is seeking a solution that will adequately service the current City environment, specific as:

              •   Approximately 6,000 PRA requests a year
              •   12 Departments (30 Divisions)

         7.1   Cost Summary
               This Section addresses price and should be presented according to the format shown in
               Attachment 8: Cost Proposal Form.

               1. Identify major Project milestones. It is required that costs will be invoiced upon
                  acceptance and completion of major milestones.
               2. The Cost Proposal format must coincide with the Vendors’ Scope of Work and
                  Deliverables as defined in the vendor’s Proposal. Cost Proposals that do not parallel the
                  Technical Proposal, or omit cost data for the proposed work items, may be omitted from
                  further consideration in the evaluation process.
               3. Provide a schedule of payments necessary to complete the proposed scope.
               4. Complete and submit Attachment 8: Cost Proposal Form.
                  • It is important that Vendors use the format provided herein. Attachment 8: Cost
                      Proposal Form should include total price for all software, services, and additional costs
                      to acquire all software and services referenced in the Proposal including third-party
                      prices. If third-party products or services are included, do not provide separate versions
                      of Attachment 8 for each third-party product.
                  • All pricing must be submitted as deliverable-based invoice fixed by milestone.
                      Costs listed as “to-be-determined” or “estimated” will not be scored.
                  • All service costs must be provided on a task or completion basis with costs assigned to
                      each milestone, deliverable and/or task. Vendors are required to fill in deliverables and
                      tasks under the provided headers (initial knowledge transfer, process analysis/system
                      design, system build, testing, training, and closure) Additional details may be provided
                      to further explain deliverable/task costs.
                  • Vendors should include all software modules and state any limitations on module use.
                      If no limitations are listed, the City will consider that pricing is based on full enterprise
                      wide access for the City.
                  • Vendors must submit implementation costs as fully loaded rates that include all
                      necessary travel and other expenses. By submitting a Proposal, all Vendors
                      acknowledge that all pricing (including travel) is fixed fee and included within
                      milestones.
                  • Vendors shall list ongoing maintenance costs for a period of 5 years.

         7.2   Detailed Systems Costs & Payment Schedule

               Vendors will provide a detailed cost and payment schedule for your proposed products and
               services in this section. The payment schedule should be based on, and list, project deliverables
               and associated payments. (The payment schedule should be aligned and reflect the same
               numbering as the Scope of Work and the MS Project Schedule.)
                  1.   Software Costs
                  2.   Software Hosting Cost (if separate from software costs)
                  3.   Maintenance Cost
                  4.   System Software
                  5.   Other Costs (not identified in the City’s RFP document)

               Vendors will fill out Attachment 8: Cost Proposal Form (Excel), to provide their detailed system
               costs.

         7.3   Optional Costs Not Identified in the RFP
               Vendors will also provide any costs for products and/or services not specified in this document.
               Vendors will fill out Attachment 8: Cost Proposal Form spreadsheet, to provide their optional
               costs.

         7.4   Hourly Rates

               Vendors will provide a table indicating the hourly billing rate for all project personnel. This will
               also include the hourly billing rates for all subcontractors, if applicable. One averaged hourly
               billing rate for project team members will not meet this required and may deem the Proposal
               non-responsive. This information may be referenced for future work.

SECTION 8: EXCEPTIONS TO THE RFP

         This Section addresses the Vendor identified Exceptions to the RFP. All requested information in
         this RFP should be provided; however, the City will consider identified exceptions to requirements
         in this RFP. The City, at its sole discretion, may accept or reject any such Exceptions identified in
         the Proposal.

         Exceptions shall be clearly identified in this Section, with a written explanation of the
         Exception and an alternate proposal (if applicable).

         To avoid the scenario where the City is unable to negotiate successfully with its finalist Vendor,
         any material Exceptions to the RFP, including those to the terms and conditions listed in Section
         VII (CONTRACT CONDITIONS FOR PROJECT), will be clarified prior to the issuance of
         Notification for elevation to Software Demonstration Presentations.

SECTION 9: SAMPLE DOCUMENTS

         This Section addresses documents originating from the Vendor; including sample copies of the
         following:
             1. Any sample agreements that the City would be required to sign upon contract award. This
                 would include any applicable software license agreements, professional service agreements,
                 hosting agreements, third-party agreements, etc.
             2. Sample of or excerpt from a PRA software system design document.

SECTION 10: CONTRACT TERMINATIONS

         If your organization has had a contract terminated in the last five (5) years, describe such
         incident. Termination for default is defined as notice to stop performance due to the vendor’s non-
         performance or poor performance and the issue of performance was either (a) not litigated due to
         inaction on the part of the vendor, or (b) litigated and such litigation determined that the vendor was
         in default.

         Submit full details of the terms for default including the other party’s name, address, and phone
         number. Present the vendor’s position on the matter. The City will evaluate the facts and may, at its
         sole discretion, reject the Proposal on the grounds of the past experience.

         If the firm has not experienced any such termination for default or early termination in the past five
         (5) years, so indicate.

SECTION 11: CONTRACT

         11.1     Vendor Comments to City Agreements
                  Vendors may take exception to certain terms and conditions in the standard City
                  Agreement. Vendors shall provide their comments in this section. The City, at its sole
                  discretion, may negotiate or reject any exceptions within the proposal.

         11.2     Vendor Agreements
                  Vendors should include sample copies of the following documents:
                  1. Sample software licensing agreement
                  2. Sample hosting agreement
                  3. Sample maintenance agreement

VI       PROPOSAL EVALUATION
6.1      Evaluation Process

         6.1.1    The City shall make an award on the basis of best value. Best value is defined as a combination
                  of quality, price, and the elements of required services that in total are optimal relative to the
                  City’s needs.

         6.1.2    The City’s evaluation process will be comprised of several phases:
                  1.   Phase One: Initial Selection
                  2.   Phase Two: Elevation
                  3.   Phase Three: Demonstration
                  4.   Phase Four: Best and Final Offer (BAFO), Negotiations and Final Selection

6.2      Evaluation & Selection Team

         6.2.1    A cross-functional team of City staff will comprise the Evaluation Selection Team, with
                  representation from the functional areas identified herein, the City’s department stakeholders
                  includes Information Technology department. This team is responsible for evaluation and
                  scoring of the proposals, Vendors demonstrations, and other evaluation tasks that may include
                  site visits.

         6.2.2    A broader Advisory Group consisting of subject matter experts from the City’s departments
                  will be established to participate in various phases and provide input on specific modules that
                  are being assessed.

         6.2.3    The Evaluation Selection Team will make a procurement recommendation to the Project’s
                  Advisory Group.

         6.2.4    The City reserves the right to award the contract in phases, in total, or not at all.

6.3      Pre-qualification Process

         Vendors that do not demonstrate they meet the minimum qualifications outlined in this document
         will not be considered for further evaluation. This determination will be at the sole discretion of the
         City

6.4      Phase One: Initial Selection

         The Selection Committee will first determine if each submitted proposal is responsive to this RFP. A
         responsive proposal is a proposal that conforms to all the material aspects of the requirements in the
         RFP, a demonstrated understanding of the RFP requirements and the financial stability to successfully
         implement a comprehensive PRA software. The Committee will determine whether each Vendor
         correctly submitted and completed all of the necessary forms, documents, attachments and information
         in the format requested. If the City, at its sole discretion, determines a proposal to be non-responsive,
         the proposal will not be elevated to Phase Two of the process.

6.5      Phase Two: Elevation

         In Phase Two of the review process, the Selection Committee will review the Vendor’s written
         proposals and determine that each responsible Vendor has the capacity, experience, knowledge,
         understanding, and reliability to fully perform the contract requirements. Phase Two will be weighted

6.6      Phase Three: Demonstrations

         In this phase, no more than the top two (2) ranking vendors will be elevated and invited by the City
         for demonstration of the firm’s proposed software. The City will interview key Vendor staff to be
         assigned to the project. Vendors that are elevated will be given a date for its scheduled presentation.
         The City will use the following evaluation scoring method for Phase 3.

         A schedule and demonstration scripts for presentation components will be provided to each Vendor
         two weeks prior to its scheduled presentation date. The objective of the demonstration phase will be
         to assess the extent the Vendors’ product will meet the business needs of the City. Vendors selected
         to continue on to this phase will be expected to follow demonstration “scripts” provided by the City.

         6.6.1    These scripted demonstrations will be used to assess the following:
                  • Ability to successfully address business requirements as required by the scripts.
                  • Ability to support the City’s business process and service delivery improvement goals.
                  • Ability to propose solutions to meet the City’s current and future needs.
         6.6.2    The flexibility offered by the System and its ease of use.
         6.6.3    Demonstrations will not include any functionality that is considered beta or part of a future
                  release.
         6.6.4    This phase may also include site visits to other agencies by the City’s evaluation team to see
                  successfully installed solutions.

          The City will provide an Internet connection if needed; however, access and/or response time
          problems may be experienced. Such access will be coordinated in advance upon request by the
          Vendors. Each Vendors should evaluate the risks and consider supplying their Internet access.

6.7      Phase Four: Best and Final Offer (BAFO), Contract Negotiation and Selection

         The City will select a finalist to complete software and implementation negotiations. If third-party
         software is involved, the City may elect to negotiate with these vendors first. Price shall be considered
         but need not be the sole determining factor. The primary vendor will be expected to assist with
         negotiations, including submis sion of best and final offer(s).

         The City may ask for written clarification to the initial proposal from the finalist, including any
         exceptions the Vendors may have to contract conditions included in the RFP. Contract negotiations
         will allow all parties to seek clarification on project scope, expectations, deliverables, and ask any
         remaining questions. Negotiations with elevated Vendors will seek any information the City needs to
         satisfy concerns and issues and may include a review of any aspect of the proposal where questions
         remain. Software licensing agreements will be reviewed in detail with these Vendors, and exceptions
         to the proposed contract conditions will be reviewed and evaluated.

         If the negotiations result in a satisfactory agreement, a contract will be recommended to Berkeley’s
         City Council for approval. If negotiations with the top finalist Vendor are not satisfactory, the City
         will go to the next highest ranked Vendor and so on until an agreement can be reached.

6.8      Award

         As part of the award process, the City reserves the rights to:
         • Accept or reject any or all proposals;
         • Waive any informality in proposals received;
         • Accept or reject any or all of the items in the proposal;
         • Award the contract in whole or in part and/or negotiate any or all items with individual Vendors
             if it is deemed in City’s best interest;
         • Make no selection if proposals are deemed to be outside the fiscal constraint or not in the best
             interests of the City;
         • Waive any irregularities and technicalities and may, at its sole discretion, request a clarification or
             other information to evaluate any or all proposals;
         • Prior to awarding the contract, require Vendors to submit evidence of qualifications or any other
             information the City may deem necessary;
         • Prior to award cancel the RFP or portions thereof, without penalty.

VII      CONTRACT CONDITIONS FOR PROJECT
Below are important contract terms and conditions that the City expects to be part of an agreement with the
finalist Vendor. Please indicate your willingness to comply with each condition by noting any exceptions per
the instructions in Section V. Submission Requirements, EXCEPTIONS TO THE RFP. Contract terms in the
final agreement should include but will not be limited to those listed below. The City will carefully evaluate
any Exceptions to the terms and conditions listed below.

7.1      Key Personnel

         The City requires assurances as to the consistency and quality of the Vendor’s staffing for this Project.
         Key points of the City’s key Consultant’s personnel provision will include:

         Work under this Agreement shall be performed only by competent personnel under the
         supervision of and in the employment of Vendor. The City shall have the ability to interview
         and approve or reject project manager and project team members proposed by the Vendor.
         Vendor’s project manager and project team members who have been approved by the City may
         not be removed from the Project without the City’s approval. The City shall have the right to
         dismiss project manager and project team members from the Project if it believes they are not
         performing adequately.

7.2      Implied and Express Warranty

         Vendor expressly warrants that the proposed and implemented system will conform in all material
         respects to the requirements and specifications stated in the Scope of Services including the functional
         requirements in Attachment 4: Business Process Functional & Technical Requirements for a period no
         less than 36 months after final acceptance. The rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to
         and do not limit any rights afforded to the City by any other clause of this contract.

7.3      Express Warranty Remedy and Software Escrow

         Vendor agrees to repair or replace any function not working in the system during the life of the
         warranty. In the event a problem cannot be fixed or replaced, the Vendor shall refund the full amount
         paid for the software, its implementation, and any paid hosting and/or maintenance costs.

7.4      System Acceptance

         For purposes of acceptance of the system (or portions thereof), the City intends to use a two-staged
         acceptance procedure for each phase and for the entire Project. Key points include:

         7.4.1    “Conditional Acceptance” will occur at or prior to go-live. The City will have up to forty-five
                  (45) days to test the system (“pre-live testing”) before going live.

         7.4.2    The City will have a 90-day period after Conditional Acceptance to “live test” the system.
                  Live testing is the City’s opportunity to verify that the system complies with the functional
                  requirements and any other written specifications delivered to the City by the vendor during
                  the course of the project.
         7.4.3    If after the live testing the system performs in accordance with the system specifications
                  (including the design document and functional requirements), the City will issue “Final
                  Acceptance.” The 90-day timeframe for Final Acceptance shall be extended if problems are
                  found in the live test. Specifically, the City expects to document the date the problem is found
                  and the date it is certified as fixed. The acceptance period would pause when issues are

                  reported and would restart on the date the problem is certified as fixed. The warranty period
                  shall begin at the time of Final Acceptance.

7.5      Milestones Deliverables

         The City requires that all payments be based on successful completion of milestones. After the City’s
         acceptance of the milestone, the vendor will invoice for any applicable milestone payments. Milestone
         payment amount shall be a fixed fee for the milestone.

7.6      Additional Users and Modules

         The City will require “price protection” for a minimum of two (2) years from the effective date of
         the agreement for additional City users and modules that are listed in the Proposal but are not
         initially purchased.

7.7      Restrictions on Growth

         The City requires that any proposed licenses or fees to access the software be adequate to allow the
         City to use the system unrestricted for all business purposes of the City and the City agencies,
         departments, and other third-party entities listed in this RFP. The City will not be subject to expansion
         fees, additional license purchases, or fees for additional users, increases in City employee count,
         budget size, population size, or data storage requirements for a period of 5 years from the effective
         date of the agreement.


VIII CITY REQUIREMENTS
8.1      Non-Discrimination Requirements

         Ordinance No. 5876-N.S. codified in B.M.C. Chapter 13.26 states that, for contracts worth more than
         $3,000 bids for supplies or bids or proposals for services shall include a completed Workforce
         Composition Form. Businesses with fewer than five employees are exempt from submitting this form.
         (See B.M.C. 13.26.030)

         Under B.M.C. section 13.26.060, the City may require any bidder or vendor it believes may have
         discriminated to submit a Non-Discrimination Program. The Contract Compliance Officer will make
         this determination. This applies to all contracts and all consultants (contractors). Berkeley Municipal
         Code section 13.26.070 requires that all contracts with the City contain a non-discrimination clause,
         in which the contractor agrees not to discriminate and allows the City access to records necessary to
         monitor compliance. This section also applies to all contracts and all consultants. Bidders must
         submit the attached Non-Discrimination Disclosure Form with their proposal

8.2      Nuclear Free Berkeley Disclosure Form

         Berkeley Municipal Code section 12.90.070 prohibits the City from granting contracts to companies
         that knowingly engage in work for nuclear weapons. This contracting prohibition may be waived if
         the City Council determines that no reasonable alternative exists to doing business with a company
         that engages in nuclear weapons work. If your company engages in work for nuclear weapons, explain
         on the Disclosure Form the nature of such work. Bidders must submit the attached Nuclear Free
         Disclosure Form with their proposal.




                                             November 2018

8.3      Oppressive States

         The City of Berkeley prohibits granting of contracts to firms that knowingly provide personal services
         to specified Countries. This contracting prohibition may be waived if the City Council determines that
         no reasonable alternative exists to doing business with a company that is covered by City Council
         Resolution No. 59,853-N.S. If your company or any subsidiary is covered, explain on the Disclosure
         Form the nature of such work. Bidders must submit the attached Oppressive States Disclosure
         Form with their proposal.

8.4      Conflict of Interest

         In the sole judgment of the City, any and all proposals are subject to disqualification on the basis of a
         conflict of interest. The City may not contract with a vendor if the vendor or an employee, officer or
         director of the Vendor's firm, or any immediate family member of the preceding, has served as an
         elected official, employee, board or commission member of the City who influences the making of the
         contract or has a direct or indirect interest in the contract.

         Furthermore, the City may not contract with any vendor whose income, investment, or real property
         interest may be affected by the contract. The City, at its sole option, may disqualify any proposal on
         the basis of such a conflict of interest. Please identify any person associated with the firm that has
         a potential conflict of interest.

8.5      Berkeley Living Wage Ordinance

         Chapter 13.27 of the Berkeley Municipal Code requires that contractors offer all eligible employees
         with City mandated minimum compensation during the term of any contract that may be awarded by
         the City. If the Contractor is not currently subject to the Living Wage Ordinance, cumulative contracts
         with the City within a one-year period may subject Contractor to the requirements under B.M.C.
         Chapter 13.27. A certification of compliance with this ordinance will be required upon execution of a
         contract. The Living Wage rate is currently $14.04 (if medical benefits are provided) or $16.37 (if
         medical benefits are not provided). The Living Wage rate is adjusted automatically effective June 30th
         of each year commensurate with the corresponding increase in the Consumer Price Index published in
         April of each year. If the Living Wage rate is adjusted during the term of your agreement, you must
         pay the new adjusted rate to all eligible employees, regardless of what the rate was when the contract
         was executed.

8.6      Berkeley Equal Benefits Ordinance

         Chapter 13.29 of the Berkeley Municipal Code requires that contractors offer domestic partners the
         same access to benefits that are available to spouses. A certification of compliance with this ordinance
         will be required upon execution of a contract.

8.7      Statement of Economic Interest

         The City’s Conflict of Interest Code designates “consultants” as a category of persons who must
         complete Form 700, Statement of Economic Interest, at the beginning of the contract period and again
         at the termination of the contract. The selected contractor will be required to complete the Form 700
         before work may begin.

IX       OTHER REQUIREMENTS
9.1      Insurance

         General Liability and Automobile Insurance The selected contractor will be required to maintain
         general liability insurance in the minimum amount of $2,000,000, automobile liability insurance in the
         minimum amount of $1,000,000 and a professional liability insurance policy in the amount of
         $2,000,000 to cover any claims arising out of the performance of the contract. The general liability
         and automobile insurance must name the City, its officers, agents, volunteers and employees as
         additional insureds.

         Technology Professional Liability Errors and Omissions Insurance appropriate to the Vendor’s
         profession and work hereunder, with limits not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence. Coverage shall
         be sufficiently broad to respond to the duties and obligations as is undertaken by the Vendor in this
         agreement and shall include, but not be limited to, claims involving infringement of intellectual
         property, copyright, trademark, invasion of privacy violations, information theft, release of private
         information, extortion and network security. The policy shall provide coverage for breach response
         costs as well as regulatory fines and penalties as well as credit monitoring expenses with limits
         sufficient to respond to these obligations.

         a. The Policy shall include, or be endorsed to include, property damage liability coverage for
         damage to, alteration of, loss of, or destruction of electronic data and/or information “property” of
         the Agency in the care, custody, or control of the Vendor. If not covered under the Vendor’s liability

         to, alteration of, loss of, or destruction of electronic data and/or information “property” of the

         this agreement. Any insurance proceeds in excess of the specified limits and coverage required, which
         are applicable to a given loss, shall be available to Agency. No representation is made that the
         minimum Insurance requirements of this agreement are sufficient to cover the indemnity or other
         obligations of the Vendor under this agreement.

9.2      Worker’s Compensation Insurance

         A selected contractor who employs any person shall maintain workers' compensation insurance in
         accordance with state requirements. Sole proprietors with no employees are not required to carry
         Worker’s Compensation Insurance.

9.3      Business License

         Virtually every contractor that does business with the City must obtain a City business license as
         mandated by B.M.C. Ch. 9.04. The business license requirement applies whether or not the contractor
         has an office within the City limits. However, a "casual" or "isolated" business transaction (B.M.C.
         section 9.04.010) does not subject the contractor to the license tax. Warehousing businesses and
         charitable organizations are the only entities specifically exempted in the code from the license
         requirement (see B.M.C. sections, 9.04.295 and 9.04.300). Non-profit organizations are granted partial
         exemptions (see B.M.C. section 9.04.305). Persons who, by reason of physical infirmity, unavoidable

         misfortune, or unavoidable poverty, may be granted an exemption of one annual free license at the
         discretion of the Director of Finance. (see B.M.C. sections 9.04.290).

         Vendor must apply for a City business license and show proof of application to Purchasing Manager
         within seven days of being selected as intended contractor.

         The Customer Service Division of the Finance Department located at 1947 Center Street, Berkeley,
         CA 94704, issues business licenses. Contractors should contact this division for questions and/or
         information on obtaining a City business license, in person, or by calling 510-981-7200.

9.4      Recycled Paper

         All reports to the City shall be on recycled paper that contains at least 50% recycled product when
         such paper is available at a cost of not greater than ten percent more than the cost of virgin paper, and
         when such paper is available at the time it is required. If recycled paper is not available the Contractor
         shall use white paper. Written reports or studies shall be printed on both sides of the page whenever
         practical.

9.4      State Prevailing Wage

         Certain labor categories under this project may be subject to prevailing wages as identified in the State
         of California Labor Code commencing in Section 1770 et. seq. These labor categories, when employed
         for any “work performed during the design and preconstruction phases of construction including, but
         not limited to, inspection and land surveying work,” constitute a “Public Work” within the definition
         of Section 1720(a)(1) of the California Labor Code requiring payment of prevailing wages.

         Wage information is available through the California Division of Industrial Relations web site at:
         http://www.dir.ca.gov/OPRL/statistics_and_databases.html

Thank you for your interest in working with the City of Berkeley for this service. We look forward to
receiving your Proposal.

I (we) certify that:

  1.     I am (we are) fully cognizant of any and all contracts held, products made or otherwise handled
         by this business entity, and of any such that are anticipated to be entered into, produced or
         handled for the duration of its contract(s) with the City of Berkeley. (To this end, more than
         one individual may sign this disclosure form, if a description of which type of contracts each
         individual is cognizant is attached.)

  2.     I (we) understand that Section 12.90.070 of the Nuclear Free Berkeley Act (Berkeley
         Municipal Code Ch. 12.90; Ordinance No. 5784-N.S.) prohibits the City of Berkeley from
         contracting with any person or business that knowingly engages in work for nuclear weapons.

  3.     I (we) understand the meaning of the following terms as set forth in Berkeley Municipal Code
         Section 12.90.130:

         "Work for nuclear weapons" is any work the purpose of which is the development, testing,
         production, maintenance or storage of nuclear weapons or the components of nuclear
         weapons; or any secret or classified research or evaluation of nuclear weapons; or any
         operation, management or administration of such work.

         "Nuclear weapon" is any device, the intended explosion of which results from the energy
         released by reactions involving atomic nuclei, either fission or fusion or both. This definition
         of nuclear weapons includes the means of transporting, guiding, propelling or triggering the
         weapon if and only if such means is destroyed or rendered useless in the normal propelling,
         triggering, or detonation of the weapon.

         "Component of a nuclear weapon" is any device, radioactive or non-radioactive, the primary
         intended function of which is to contribute to the operation of a nuclear weapon (or be a part
         of a nuclear weapon).

         nuclear weapons or anticipates entering into such work for the duration of its contract(s) with

Based on the foregoing, the undersigned declares under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
California that the foregoing is true and correct.

morally repugnant regimes. Vendor understands the meaning of the following terms used in the Resolution:

contractor or providing any consulting advice or assistance, or otherwise acting as an agent pursuant to a contractual
relationship.”

Contractor understands that it is not eligible to receive or retain a City contract if at the time the contract is executed, or
at any time during the term of the contract it provides Personal Services to:

    a.   The governing regime in any Oppressive State.
    b.   Any business or corporation organized under the authority of the governing regime of any Oppressive State.
    c.   Any person for the express purpose of assisting in business operations or trading with any public or private
         entity located in any Oppressive State.

Vendor further understands and agrees that Vendor's failure to comply with the Resolution shall constitute a default of
the contract and the City Manager may terminate the contract and bar Vendor from bidding on future contracts with the
City for five (5) years from the effective date of the contract termination.

The undersigned is familiar with, or has made a reasonable effort to become familiar with, Vendor's business structure
and the geographic extent of its operations. By executing the Statement, Vendor certifies that it complies with the
requirements of the Resolution and that if any time during the term of the contract it ceases to comply, Vendor will
