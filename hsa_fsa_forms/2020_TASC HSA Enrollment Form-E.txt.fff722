Terms, Conditions and Signature

Important Information Regarding Patriot Act Requirements
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial organizations to
obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each individual who opens an account. What this means for you, when you open an
account, you are required to provide your name, residential address, date of birth, and identification number. As part of the ongoing
maintenance of your account we may require other information or documentation that allows us to identify you. You understand that
your HSA may be closed if additional verification is not possible. Upon such closure, funds deposited in your HSA will be returned to
you, less any fees or expenses chargeable against your HSA, or penalties or surrender charges associated with the early withdrawal of
any savings instrument or other investment in your HSA account. As custodian, Healthcare Bank, a division of Bell Bank shall not be
liable for any tax consequences or tax withholdings you may incur as a result of the transfer or distribution of your assets.

Important Information about Electronic Payments
I authorize electronic debit and credit entries, if applicable, to my designated checking or savings account. I also authorize adjustments
to these accounts for error corrections. This authorization will remain in effect until the termination of your HSA.

Important Information about your Account
The maximum balance allowed in my Cash Account is based on the designated threshold established by my HSA Administrator or me.

Important Information Regarding Death Beneficiary Information
If neither primary nor contingent is indicated, the individual or entity will be deemed to be a primary death beneficiary. If any primary or
contingent death beneficiary dies before me, his or her interest and the interest of his or her heirs shall terminate completely, and the
percentage share of any remaining death beneficiary(ies) shall be increased on a pro rata basis. If more than one primary death
beneficiary is designated and no distribution percentages are indicated, the death beneficiaries will be deemed to own equal share
percentages in the HSA. Multiple contingent death beneficiaries with no share percentage indicated will also be deemed to share
equally. If no primary death beneficiary(ies) survives me, the contingent death beneficiary(ies) shall acquire the designated share of my
HSA.

I understand that if I designate my spouse as primary death beneficiary or contingent death beneficiary of the HSA, the dissolution,
termination, annulment or other legal termination of my marriage will automatically revoke such designation.

Important Information Regarding My Account Summary
I understand that account summaries are made available electronically and may be viewed at any time by logging into my account at
https://Partners.tasconline.com/TASC1PPT. The Healthcare Bank Privacy policy is available online at www.healthcarebank.com.

Important Information Regarding My HSA Investment Account
I understand that once I have accumulated the designated threshold in cash in my HSA as set forth by my HSA Administrator or me in
the Application, the balance of my account above the designated threshold will automatically be invested in an interest-bearing, FDIC-
insured account. For purposes of this enrollment form, “Application” shall mean the WEX Health Cloud system available through a link
provided by my HSA Administrator which provides me access to my HSA account information, Investment Account and is used to
process my HSA transactions. I may also choose to change my allocation choices and select from the available list of mutual funds for
the investment of HSA assets in excess of the designated threshold. The HSA Investment Account is exclusively available online at
https://Partners.tasconline.com/TASC1PPT. An email address must be included in enrollment or it will not be available. All investment
transactions in the HSA Investment Account will be initiated and conducted electronically. All required disclosures of investment
information and trade confirmations will be made electronically, and by opening an HSA Investment Account I consent to the electronic
delivery/access of all documents of any issuer whose securities are made available to my HSA, including issuers and securities made
available after the date my account is opened.

Important Information Regarding Substitute W-9 Certification
Under penalties of perjury, I certify that: (1) the Social Security Number shown on this form is my correct taxpayer identification number
and, (2) I am not subject to backup withholding because (a) I am exempt from backup withholding, or (b) I have not been notified by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that I am subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends, or (c)
the IRS has notified me that I am no longer subject to backup withholding, and (3) I am a U.S. citizen (including a U.S. resident alien).

Important Information Regarding Fees
Any applicable fees shall be deducted from my account. Fees payable in connection with my HSA are set forth on the attached fee
schedule.

Important Information Regarding Custodial and Investment Information
I have read and understand the HSA Custodial Agreement and Disclosure Statement and agree to be bound by those terms and
conditions. I understand the eligibility requirements for this HSA and I state that I am responsible for determining whether I qualify to
make deposits to this HSA. I am responsible for:

a.   determining that I am eligible to make contributions to an HSA for each year I make a contribution;

b.   ensuring that all contributions are within the maximum limitations set forth by the tax laws, taking into account my coverage under a
     high deductible health plan;

c.   the tax consequences of any contributions (including rollover contributions) or distributions; and

d.   seeking the assistance of a qualified tax or legal professional to address any questions or concerns I may have about eligibility,
     contribution limitations, or the taxation of contributions or distributions from my HSA.

If I choose to select an investment allocation from the available list of mutual funds, I will be solely responsible for direction of the
investment of my HSA. I represent that I will carefully review investment information prior to making investment decisions and that I will
seek assistance of a financial professional if I have questions about available investment options or how to select investments for my
HSA.

I authorize Healthcare Bank, a division of Bell Bank, and its agents to initiate permitted transfers, including contributions, to my HSA, as

                                    Custodial Agreement and Disclosure Statement

The Accountholder is establishing this Health Savings Account (“HSA”) exclusively for the purpose of paying or
reimbursing qualified medical expenses of the Accountholder, his or her spouse, and dependents. The Accountholder
represents that, unless this account is used solely to make rollover contributions, he or she is eligible to contribute to this
HSA; specifically, that he or she (1) is covered under a high deductible health plan (“HDHP”), (2) is not also covered by
any other health plan that is not an HDHP (with certain exceptions for plans providing preventive care and limited types of
permitted insurance and permitted coverage), (3) is not enrolled in Medicare, and (4) cannot be claimed as a dependent
on another person’s tax return. Healthcare Bank, a division of Bell Bank is the “Custodian” under this agreement.

The Accountholder and the Custodian make the following agreement:

                                                           Article I.

1.01    The Custodian will accept cash contributions for the tax year made by the Accountholder or on behalf of the
Accountholder (by an employer, family member or any other person). No contributions will be accepted by the Custodian
for any Accountholder that exceeds the maximum amount for family coverage plus the catch-up contribution (for
individuals who attain age fifty-five (55) before the close of the tax year).

1.02   Contributions for any tax year may be made at any time before the deadline for filing the Accountholder’s federal
income tax return for that year (without extensions).

1.03   Rollover or transfer contributions from an HSA, Individual Retirement Account, or an Archer Medical Savings
account (Archer MSA) are permitted subject to applicable rules.

                                                          Article II.

2.01    Contributions to the Accountholder’s HSA are subject to a maximum annual limit, based on whether the
Accountholder has elected single or family coverage under the HDHP. For calendar year 2017, the maximum annual
contribution limit for an Accountholder with single coverage is $3,400 and will be $3,450 in 2018. For calendar year 2017,
the maximum annual contribution limit for an Accountholder with family coverage is $6,750 and will be $6,900 in calendar
year 2018. These limits are subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments. Eligibility and contribution limits are determined
on a month-to-month basis.

2.02    Contributions to Archer MSAs or other HSAs count toward the maximum annual contribution limit to this HSA.

2.03    An additional $1,000 catch-up contribution may be made for an Accountholder who is at least age fifty-five (55) or
older and not enrolled in Medicare.

2.04    Contributions in excess of the maximum annual contribution limit are subject to an excise tax. However, the
catch-up contributions are not subject to an excise tax.

                                                          Article III.

It is the responsibility of the Accountholder to determine whether contributions to this HSA have exceeded the maximum
annual contribution limit described in Article II. If contributions to this HSA or any combination of your HSAs exceed the
maximum annual contribution limit, the Accountholder shall remove the excess contributions. It is the responsibility of the
Accountholder to timely request the withdrawal of the excess contribution and any net income attributable to such excess
contribution. Regardless of which year excess contributions were made, a withdrawal of excess contributions will be
reported as having occurred in the tax year of such withdrawal.

                                                          Article IV.

The Accountholder’s interest in the balance in this custodial account is nonforfeitable.

                                                          Article V.

5.01    No part of the custodial funds in this account may be invested in life insurance contracts or in collectibles as
defined in Section 408(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).

5.02  The assets of this account may not be commingled with other property, except in a common trust fund or
common investment fund.

5.03    Neither the Accountholder nor the Custodian will engage in any prohibited transaction with respect to this account
(such as borrowing or pledging the account or engaging in any other prohibited transaction as defined in the Code
Section 4975).

                                                          Article VI.

6.01   Debit Card payments and distributions of funds from this HSA may be made upon the direction of the
Accountholder.

6.02     Distributions from this HSA that are used exclusively to pay or reimburse qualified medical expenses of the
Accountholder, his or her spouse, or dependents are not subject to federal taxes. However, distributions that are not used
for qualified medical expenses are included in the Accountholder’s gross income and are subject to an additional twenty
percent (20%) tax on that amount. The additional twenty percent (20%) tax does not apply if the distribution is made after
the Accountholder’s death, disability, or reaching age sixty-five (65).

6.03     The Custodian is not required to determine whether the distribution is for the payment or reimbursement of
qualified medical expenses. Only the Accountholder is responsible for substantiating that the distribution is for qualified
medical expenses and must maintain records sufficient to show, if required, that the distribution is not subject to federal
taxes.

                                                         Article VII.

If the Accountholder dies before the entire interest in the account is distributed, the entire account will be disposed of as
follows:

7.01    If the beneficiary is the Accountholder’s spouse, the HSA shall become the spouse’s HSA as of the date of death.

7.02    If the beneficiary is not the Accountholder's spouse, the HSA shall cease to be an HSA as of the date of death. If
the beneficiary is the Accountholder’s estate or if there is no beneficiary, the fair market value of the account as of the
date of death is taxable on the Accountholder’s final personal income tax return. For other beneficiaries, the fair market
value of the Accountholder is taxable to that person in the tax year that includes such date.

                                                         Article VIII.

8.01    The Accountholder agrees to provide the Custodian with information necessary for the Custodian to prepare any
reports or returns required by the IRS.

8.02    The Custodian agrees to prepare and submit any reports or returns as prescribed by the IRS.

                                                          Article IX.

Notwithstanding any other article that may be added or incorporated in this agreement, the provisions of Articles I through
VIII and this sentence are controlling. Any additional article in this agreement that is inconsistent with the Code Section
223 will be void.
                                                          Article X.
This agreement will be amended from time to time to comply with the provisions of the Code or IRS published guidance.
Other amendments may be made with the consent of the Accountholder. Your HSA is established with the Custodian on
the date it is set up with the Custodian. If the initial account is established after the first of the month, the HSA is
established the first of the following month. The Custodian makes no representation whether expenses incurred after the
establishment date of an unfunded HSA may be reimbursed from contributions that are made on a later date.

                                                          Article XI

11.01   Definitions. In this part of the agreement, the words:

        a.       “You” and “your” shall mean Accountholder who is the person who owns the HSA.

        b.       “We”, “us” and “our” shall refer to the Custodian.

        c.      “Business Day” shall mean any day that the Federal Reserve Bank and the New York Stock Exchange
        are both open for business.

        d.      “Close of Market” shall mean 3:00 pm Central Standard Time (“CST”), unless there is an early market
        close, designated by the NYSE, due to a holiday or other event.

11.02 Service Providers. We will maintain custody of your HSA assets in your cash account (“Cash Account”) and
investment account (“Investment Account”). We are authorized to place securities orders, settle security trades, hold
securities in custody and perform related activities on your behalf. We are also authorized to contract for or make other
arrangements with any affiliate or third party for the provision of necessary services to your HSA.

We have entered into an agreement for certain recordkeeping and administration duties with a third party HSA
administrator (“HSA Administrator”). The HSA Administrator has also entered into an agreement with you or your
employer to receive and forward contributions to your HSA, and provide other related services. Under this agreement,
your HSA Administrator is authorized and directed to: (a) provide you with access to a personal HSA website account, (b)
maintain electronic records showing the assets of your HSA and records of contributions, distributions, investment
sweeps and any other related transactions, (c) process distribution requests from your HSA, (d) maintain all information
necessary for us to prepare required returns, reports, or other documents for applicable taxing authorities, including IRS
Forms 1099-SA and 5498-SA, and (e) provide related services.

All of your questions and comments should be directed to your HSA Administrator through its website or by other means
made available to you through your HSA Administrator. You must provide all investment instructions through the
Investment Portal.

If we terminate our agreement with your HSA Administrator, we may resign on the effective date of termination of the
agreement between us and your HSA Administrator and you are responsible for the transfer of your HSA.

If your HSA Administrator terminates its agreement with us, your HSA Administrator may also make arrangements for
transfer of your HSA to a successor custodian.

In the event you terminate employment with your employer or otherwise discontinue making contributions under your
employer’s HSA funding program, you may be offered an opportunity to continue to receive HSA services under your
HSA Administrator’s retail HSA program. You will be provided with details of that program, which may include, without
limitation, changes to your investment choices, fees, plan type, user name, password, and/or online security features.

11.03 Notices and Change of Address. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to post notices on your HSA website
account or send notices via email or U.S. Mail to the last electronic or mailing address maintained for you by your HSA
Administrator in its records. Such notice will be considered effective when posted or sent to the intended recipient,
whether by email or mail. Any notice you send to your HSA Administrator to change your email address or other mailing
address will be considered effective when actually received. In the event of your death, your spouse or account
beneficiary must notify your HSA Administrator of any corresponding change in e-mail or other mailing address. Any
notice you provide to your HSA Administrator or us will be considered effective when actually received.

11.04 Representations and Responsibilities. You represent and warrant that any information you provide us
regarding your HSA with respect to this agreement is complete and accurate. Further, you agree that any directions you
give your HSA Administrator or action you take will be proper under this agreement, and that we are entitled to rely upon
any such information or directions. If we fail to receive directions from you regarding any transaction, or we receive
ambiguous directions regarding any transaction, or we in good faith believe that any transaction requested is in dispute,
we reserve the right to take no action until further clarification acceptable to us is received from you or the appropriate
government or judicial authority. We shall not be responsible in the event of any failure or interruption of services resulting
from the act or omission of any third party service provider used to give such direction, and shall not be responsible for
any losses. We shall not be responsible for losses of any kind that may result from your directions to us or your actions or

failures to act, and you agree to reimburse us for any loss we may incur as a result of such directions, actions or failures
to act. We shall not be responsible for any penalties, taxes, judgments or expenses you incur in connection with your
HSA. We have the right, but not the obligation to require you to provide, on a form provided by or acceptable to us, proof
or certification that you are eligible to contribute to this HSA, including, but not limited to, proof or certification that you are
covered by a HDHP.

You acknowledge that establishment of your HSA is completely voluntary on your part and that, to the best of your
knowledge, your employer does not (a) limit your ability to move funds to another HSA beyond restrictions imposed by the
Code; (b) impose conditions on utilization of HSA funds beyond those permitted under the Code; (c) make or influence
the investment decisions with respect to funds contributed to an HSA; (d) represent that the HSA is an employee welfare
benefit plan established or maintained by your employer; or (e) receive any payment or compensation in connection with
the HSA.

We may permit you to appoint, through written notice acceptable to us, an authorized agent to act on your behalf with
respect to this agreement (e.g., attorney-in fact, executor, administrator or investment manager); however, we have no
duty to determine the validity of such appointment or any instrument appointing such authorized agent. We shall not be
responsible for losses of any kind that may result from directions, actions or failures to act by your authorized agent, and
you agree to reimburse us for any loss we may incur as a result of such directions, actions or failures to act by your
authorized agent. You will have thirty (30) days after you receive any notice, however received, pertaining to any
documents, account information or other information to notify us in writing of any errors or inaccuracies. If you do not
notify us within thirty (30) days, the notices, documents, account information or other information shall be deemed correct
and accurate, and we shall have no further liability.

We shall not be required to perform any additional services unless specifically agreed to under the terms and conditions
of this agreement, or as required under the Code and the applicable guidance with respect to HSAs. You agree to
indemnify and hold us and your HSA Administrator harmless for any and all claims, actions, proceedings, damages,
judgments, liabilities, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising from or in connection with this agreement. To
the extent written instructions or notices are required under this agreement, we may accept or provide such information in
any other forms permitted by law, including through electronic mediums.

11.05 Service Fees. We reserve the right to charge a periodic service fee or other designated fees (e.g., a transfer,
rollover, investment management or termination fee) for maintaining your HSA. In addition, we have the right to be
reimbursed for all reasonable expenses, including legal expenses, we incur in connection with the administration of your
HSA. We have the right to charge a $75 per hour fee for any additional services provided to you that are not described in
this agreement. We may charge you separately for any fees or expenses, or may deduct the amount of the fees or
expenses from the assets in your HSA at our discretion. We reserve the right to charge any additional fee upon thirty (30)
days’ notice to you that the fee will be effective.

Your HSA Administrator may charge a separate fee for administration and other services related to your HSA. You
authorize your HSA Administrator to charge you separately for those fees or to deduct the amount of the fees or
expenses from the assets in your HSA. Your employer may also agree to pay all or a portion of these fees on your behalf.
The amount of fees payable may be set forth in a separate fee schedule which may be part of your application or
disclosed on your HSA website account. In all cases, if your HSA Administrator closes your HSA because your account
balance does not exceed $25 for twelve (12) consecutive months, your HSA Administrator may charge you an account
closing fee equal to the lesser of $25 or the remaining balance in your HSA. If your account balance is zero and your
employment with your employer has been terminated, your HSA Administrator has the right to close your HSA
immediately.

To the extent that you direct the investment of your HSA in mutual funds, balances invested in those mutual funds are
subject to investment fees and other charges and expenses as described by the applicable prospectuses, available on
your Investment Portal and this agreement. Any brokerage commissions attributable to the assets in your HSA will be
charged to your HSA. You cannot reimburse your HSA for those commissions.

11.06 Your HSA Website Account. You will require access to the internet to open your HSA. Your HSA Administrator
will provide you with access to a personal HSA website account. You will need to establish a user name and password.
Your HSA Administrator will post all information you need to manage your HSA on your HSA website account. This
information includes your account balance, contributions, distributions, annual IRS Forms 1099-SA and 5498-SA, and any
amendments to this agreement. You agree to review your HSA at least once per month. You are responsible for
protecting access to your HSA and not sharing with anyone your username and password.

Your HSA website account has all of the information and tools you need to manage your HSA and make investments.

11.07 Cash Account. Your HSA Administrator will receive contributions (including rollovers, transfers, and mistaken
distributions) from you and/or your employer and transfer them to a contribution account maintained with us by your
HSA Administrator. We will transfer these amounts from the contribution account to the Cash Account in your HSA. The
funds in your Cash Account are separately accounted for. The funds in your Cash Account, combined with other eligible
deposits you have with us, are FDIC-insured up to $250,000 or the current maximum level, if different.

We will pay interest on funds in your Cash Account. We may revise interest rates from time to time which will be reflected
on your HSA website account.

11.08 New Accounts. Your HSA funds will be available no later than the ninth (9th) Business Day after funds are
deposited in your HSA. These restrictions may also apply to amounts contributed on your behalf by your employer.
Please refer to your HSA Administrator’s rules governing funds availability for details.

11.09 Distributions. You may access your HSA via debit card, electronic transfer or a check request. You may request
a direct transfer of your HSA balance to another HSA custodian. No distributions of in-kind transfers shall be permitted.
The Social Security Number or tax identification number of the recipient must be on file or provided to us before we are
obligated to make a distribution or transfer. Distributions shall be subject to all applicable tax and other laws and
regulations, including possible early distribution penalties or surrender charges and do not have any withholding
requirements. You have authorized electronic debit and credit entries, if applicable, to your designated checking or
savings account. You have also authorized adjustments to these accounts for error corrections. This authorization will
remain in effect until the termination of this agreement.

If you request a distribution from your HSA or use your debit card for more than the balance in your Cash Account, some
or all of your investments will be sold as described in Section 11.22 and sufficient funds will be transferred from your
Investment Account to the Cash Account to cover the amount of the distribution.

Your HSA Administrator may temporarily hold funds in contribution or distribution accounts with us in the ordinary course
of its duties. Until such time that funds deposited to a contribution account are allocated to your Cash Account, or funds
are withdrawn electronically or by check from a distribution account, any revenue we earn from the use of funds
deposited in these accounts shall be part of our compensation for servicing this HSA. You acknowledge and understand
that fees charged under this agreement would be higher if we did not earn revenue from the funds held in these accounts.

11.10 No Overdrafts Permitted. You agree not to withdraw or attempt to withdraw funds in excess of the balance in
your HSA. Should an overdraft occur, you must repay the overdraft immediately and we are not required to provide you
notice or make demand for such repayment. If you have an overdraft, we reserve the right to close your HSA without
notice to you. The closing of your HSA does not relieve you of your obligation to repay the full amount of the overdraft.
The HSA Administrator may also charge you an insufficient funds fee or a returned check fee in accordance with their
published fee schedule. Contributions made by you to your HSA shall be applied first, to any outstanding fees (including
overdraft fees) related to your HSA, and second, to any negative balance of your HSA. Until you contribute the necessary
funds to reinstate your HSA, all account activity shall be suspended. If after ninety (90) days you have not contributed the
necessary funds, then you agree to be subject to any and all collection actions needed to recover such funds and your
HSA shall be closed.

11.11 Mistaken Distributions. We may allow you to return your mistaken distributions provided there is clear and
convincing evidence that the amount(s) distributed from the HSA was because of a mistake of fact due to reasonable
cause. In determining whether this standard has been met, we shall have the ability to rely on your representation that the
distribution was, in fact, a mistake. We may not permit the return of mistaken distributions that relate to a calendar year
after December 31st of that year.

In no event shall we restrict or limit HSA distributions to the payment or reimbursement of your qualified medical
expenses. However, we may, on a case-by-case basis or as a matter of policy, place reasonable restrictions on both the
frequency and the minimum amount of distributions from the HSA.

11.12 Automatic Investment Setting. You may set up your HSA to make automatic transfers from your Cash Account
to the Investment Account on your HSA website account. Your Cash Account must exceed the investment threshold by at
least the minimum amount before transferring funds. When that occurs, the excess funds will be automatically transferred
to your Investment Account. If you do not provide instructions on where to invest such amounts the funds will be held in


HS-5910-101617                                                                                                   Page 12 of 17

an interest-bearing FDIC-insured fund within your Investment Account. Unless you make changes, your investment
allocations will remain in effect and be applied to both current and future contributions to your Investment Account.

Your automatic investment setting will not be monitored by us or your HSA Administrator. If all HSA assets are to be held
in the Cash Account you must turn off your instructions for automatic investments in your HSA website account.

Your ability to invest through your HSA depends on the balance in your Cash Account. If the investment threshold falls
below the required amount by more than the minimum amount for transferring funds, your mutual funds will be
automatically sold as described in Section 11.22 and transferred back to your Cash Account. This may require liquidation
of some or all of your investments in order to transfer the proceeds to your Cash Account.

11.13 Investment Options. Your Investment Account includes an interest-bearing FDIC-insured fund. We pay interest
on cash held in this fund at the rate described in the Investment Portal. Cash held in your Investment Account, combined
with other eligible deposits you may have with us, are FDIC-insured up to $250,000 or the then current limit.

We will also make a broad array of mutual funds available for investment. These funds are selected by an independent
registered investment advisor. You acknowledge and agree that investments, including mutual funds, are not a
deposit and are not insured by the FDIC or any federal government agency. We do not guarantee the value of
your investments, and they may lose value. You also acknowledge that past investment performance is not a
guarantee of future investment results. You agree to review investment information before you invest in mutual
funds or other investments.

The independent registered investment advisor may change available mutual funds from time to time. We will provide you
advance notice of such changes so you can modify your investment instructions. If a mutual fund is eliminated as an
investment option, and you do not provide new investment instructions, you authorize and direct us to liquidate your
balances invested in the eliminated mutual fund and transfer the proceeds to your interest-bearing FDIC-insured fund in
the Investment Account.

11.14 Investment Portal and Processing. You must complete all investment transactions, including all
communications and instructions, through the Investment Portal available through your HSA website account. You may
use the Investment Portal to place orders for the purchase and sale of mutual funds or other investments we make
available. You hereby authorize and direct us to accept such investment instructions from the Investment Portal and your
HSA website account, to pay for mutual fund share purchases from your HSA, and to transfer proceeds from the sale of
mutual fund shares to your Cash Account.

HCB will process on the same Business Day all HSA Accountholder investment Instructions received through the
Investment Portal prior to Close of Market. Any Instructions received through the Investment Portal after the Close of
Market will be processed within one (1) Business Day from receipt of complete and accurate Instructions. HSA
Accountholder’s investment Instructions received through the Investment Portal will be delayed one (1) Business Day if
there are pending investment sweep transactions. It is your responsibility to determine market holidays and when there is
an early market closing, which would cause your Instructions to be processed on the following Business Day.

You agree that we rely only on instructions received through the Investment Portal and your HSA website account, and
we have no duty to investigate any instructions. Our obligation to execute your instruction is contingent upon the
determination that the instruction can be administered and the instructions have followed our procedures. Your investment
instructions may be delayed at our discretion due to pending investment activity.

Neither we nor your HSA Administrator will provide you investment advice, or select or recommend mutual funds for you.
Neither we nor your HSA Administrator will question whether an investment you select is appropriate or suitable for you.
You agree that we will not be liable for any investment losses.

Investment transactions for your HSA will not be processed until we receive the funds to be invested and the instruction in
proper form. Investment transactions will be processed either as soon as administratively practicable thereafter or, if later,
on the scheduled date for processing.

You are solely responsible for managing the investments in your HSA and for communicating investment instructions
through the Investment Portal on your HSA website account. All instructions received from the Investment Portal or your
HSA website account shall be deemed to have been authorized by you.

11.15 Investment Fees, Expenses, Dividends and Rights. Some mutual funds may charge a redemption fee when
they are sold. Any redemption fee will be charged to your Investment Account and you cannot reimburse your HSA for
redemption fees. The mutual fund prospectus will disclose whether redemption fees apply.

Some mutual funds pay dividends or interest. Dividends and interest will be reinvested in the same mutual funds that pay
them. The prospectus for each fund will provide more information. All conversion, subscription, voting and other rights
pertaining to any securities held in your HSA, if applicable, will be exercised on your behalf. You may invest in other
investment vehicles (for example, stocks, bonds, savings accounts or other investment vehicles) only if the independent
registered investment advisor makes such investments available as investment options.

We will rebate or credit any compensation (direct or indirect) received from mutual funds for shareholder and
recordkeeping services (Investment Fee Rebate) to your Investment Account based on your holdings in each fund. The
Investment Fee Rebate is calculated at the end of each calendar quarter and received within thirty (30) days thereafter.
We will allocate your share of the Investment Fee Rebate, if any, to your Investment Account within five (5) Business
Days after receipt as additional earnings. The available mutual funds are subject to fees and expenses, as described in
the prospectus or other disclosure materials made available to you through the Investment Portal. Prior to the end of each
calendar quarter, we will deduct a custodial management fee from your Investment Account equal to one-sixteenth of one
percent (.0625%) per quarter or equal to an annual fee of one-quarter of one percent (.25%) on balances invested in
mutual funds in your Investment Account.

Funds held in the Cash Account and in the interest-bearing FDIC-insured fund in your Investment Account are used by
us for general banking purposes and may generate income to us. Such income is considered part of our compensation
for providing the HSA services.

11.16 Consent to Electronic Disclosures. By executing this agreement, you agree that all account information from
us or your HSA Administrator, including but not limited to your enrollment form, our Custodial Agreement and Disclosure

You will also need Adobe Acrobat Reader to view and download the agreements, disclosures, HSA summaries, tax forms,
investment fund information or any other applicable forms. In order to keep agreements and summaries for your records,
you will need access to a printer or the ability to download and save information.

Your HSA website account will have information about your account balance, contributions, distributions, and recent
amendments to this agreement readily available for review. Your HSA website account will provide a link or links to other
websites for you to obtain specific information about your investments, including prospectuses. It may be necessary for
you to establish a separate user name, password and/or enhanced online security feature for this purpose and complete
additional forms.

You agree to check your HSA website account no less frequently than monthly to view your HSA activity and other
communications and information and verify that all activity on your HSA is authorized activity. You are responsible for
keeping your HSA, user name, password and/or enhanced online security feature confidential, and we are not
responsible for any other person’s use of your user name, password and/or enhanced online security feature.

11.17 Custodian Powers. We may register securities in our name or in the name of our nominee without disclosing
that such securities are held as custodian or as nominee. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this agreement, we
shall have all of the powers generally conferred on custodians under the laws of the State of North Dakota. Additionally,
we shall also have the power to perform any and all acts that it deems necessary or appropriate for the proper custodial
servicing of your HSA. We may adjust the balance of your HSA as necessary to correct administrative errors, including
improperly allocated contributions, distributions, earnings or losses. In the event a check or other instrument is returned
for insufficient funds, any corresponding contributions to your HSA are also subject to adjustment by us.

11.18 Beneficiary(ies). If you die before you receive all of the funds from your HSA, payments from your HSA will be
made to your death beneficiary(ies). You may designate one (1) or more persons or entities as death beneficiary of your
HSA. This designation can only be made through your HSA website account or on a form provided by or acceptable to
us, and it will only be effective when it is filed with your HSA Administrator during your lifetime. Unless otherwise
specified, each death beneficiary designation you make through your HSA website account or file with your HSA
Administrator will cancel all previous ones. The consent of a death beneficiary(ies) shall not be required for you to revoke
a death beneficiary designation. If you have designated both primary and contingent death beneficiaries and no primary
death beneficiary(ies) survives you, the contingent death beneficiary(ies) shall acquire the designated share of your HSA.
If you do not designate a death beneficiary, or if all of your primary and contingent death beneficiary(ies) predecease you,
your estate will be the death beneficiary.

You understand that if you designate your spouse as primary death beneficiary or contingent death beneficiary of your
HSA, the dissolution, termination, annulment or other legal termination of your marriage will automatically revoke all
beneficiary designations, both primary and contingent. After such revocation and until such time as a new beneficiary
designation is completed, your HSA shall be treated as if there is no beneficiary designated.

Based on the above, if your spouse acquires the interest in your HSA by reason of being the death beneficiary at your
death, your HSA shall be treated as if the surviving spouse were the Accountholder, in order for the distribution to be
completed to your spouse; your spouse must have a valid social security number. If your death beneficiary is not your
spouse, your HSA (or in accordance with rules established by the IRS the relevant portion thereof) will cease to be an
HSA as of the date of your death. Upon learning of your death, we may, in our complete and sole discretion, make a final
distribution to a death beneficiary (other than your spouse) of his or her interest in your HSA. This distribution may be
made without the death beneficiary’s consent and may be placed in an interest-bearing (or similar) account that we
choose.

11.19 Termination of Agreement, Resignation, or Removal of the Custodian. You may terminate this agreement at
any time by giving written notice to your HSA Administrator. If this agreement is terminated by you, we or your HSA
Administrator may charge to your HSA an amount of money necessary to cover any associated costs pertaining to
terminating this agreement and closing your account.

We may close your HSA for any reason or no reason, effective thirty (30) days after we provide written notice of our
resignation to you. Upon receipt of that notice, you must make arrangements to transfer your HSA to another financial
organization. In some cases, and in our sole discretion, we may permit you to reinstate your HSA. If you do not reinstate
your HSA or complete a transfer of your HSA within thirty (30) days from the date we provide written notice to you, we
have the right to transfer your HSA assets to a qualified successor HSA custodian or trustee that we choose in our sole
discretion, or we may distribute your HSA to you in a single sum by mailing a check to your last known address. You are
responsible for determining your eligibility to roll over this amount to another HSA within thirty (30) days. Your HSA

Administrator may “escheat” this amount (transfer it) to the state of your last know residence, if the check is not presented
for payment within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date of distribution. Your HSA Administrator will attempt to
contact you before escheating the funds to the state of your last known residence. Once the funds are escheated, you
may be able to recover the funds from the state. You agree that neither we nor your HSA Administrator are responsible
for any funds that are escheated to a state.

11.20 Successor Trustee or Custodian. If we change our name, reorganize, merge with another organization (or
comes under the control of any federal or state agency), or if the entire organization (or any portion which includes your
HSA) is bought by another organization, that organization (or agency) shall automatically become the trustee or custodian
of your HSA, but only if it is the type of organization authorized to serve as an HSA trustee or custodian. If the
organization is not the type of organization authorized by law to serve as an HSA trustee or custodian, then you must
make arrangements to transfer your HSA to another financial organization. If you do not complete a transfer of your HSA
within thirty (30) days from the date we provide written notice to you, we have the right to transfer your HSA assets to a
successor HSA custodian or trustee that we choose in our sole discretion, or we may distribute your HSA to you in a
single sum by mailing a check to your last known address. You are responsible for determining your eligibility to roll over
this amount to another HSA within thirty (30) days. Your HSA Administrator may “escheat” this amount (transfer it) to the
state of your last know residence, if the check is not presented for payment within one hundred eighty (180) days of the
date of distribution. Your HSA Administrator will attempt to contact you before escheating the funds to the state of your
last known residence. Once the funds are escheated, you may be able to recover the funds from the state. You agree that
neither we nor your HSA Administrator are responsible for any funds that are escheated to a state.

11.21 Amendments. We have the right to amend this agreement at any time. Any amendment we make to comply with
federal or state law does not require your consent. You will be deemed to have consented to any other amendment
unless, within thirty (30) days from the date of notice of the amendment, you notify your HSA Administrator in writing that
you do not consent. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to notify you of any amendments by posting notice of the
amendment on your HSA website account or sending a notice of the amendment via email or U.S. Mail. If a notice
regarding an amendment to this agreement is posted on your HSA website account or sent via email or U.S. Mail, it will
be considered effective when posted on your HSA website account or sent to you at the last electronic or other mailing
address maintained for you by your HSA Administrator in its records.

11.22 Liquidation of Assets. We have the right to liquidate assets in your Investment Account if necessary to make
distributions or to pay fees, expenses, taxes, penalties or surrender charges properly chargeable against your HSA. We
will liquidate your investments in the same proportion as your investment holdings, and you agree not to hold us liable for
any adverse consequences that may result from our decision to liquidate investments in this order. You understand that
you might not receive the total amount of your requested distribution due to market fluctuations during the time period for
processing your distribution request.

11.23 What Law Applies. This agreement is subject to all applicable federal and state laws and regulations. If it is
necessary to apply any state law to interpret and administer this agreement, the laws of the State of North Dakota shall
govern. If any part of this agreement is held to be illegal or invalid, the remaining parts shall not be affected. Neither you
nor our failure to enforce at any time or for any period of time any of the provisions of this agreement shall be construed
as a waiver of such provisions or your right or our right thereafter to enforce each and every such provision.

11.24 Disclaimers. Your HSA is established by this agreement and is not intended to constitute an “employee welfare
benefit plan” or an “employee pension benefit plan” as defined by ERISA or any similar state or federal law. Regardless of
the status of the HSA under ERISA, neither we nor your HSA Administrator are a “plan administrator” or “plan sponsor” of
your HSA or of any arrangement or plan of which the HSA is a part. We expressly disclaim responsibility for ERISA’s
participation, vesting, funding, reporting, disclosure, and fiduciary requirements as they may apply to your HSA, including
but not limited to any requirement to provide notices or election forms regarding continuation coverage under ERISA. We
are not providing services to you or your HSA as a fiduciary under ERISA, under any comparable and applicable
provisions of federal, state or local law, or under the Investment Advisor’s Act of 1940, and nothing in this agreement shall
be construed as conferring fiduciary status upon us. If and to the extent that your HSA is deemed to be part of an
arrangement or plan subject to ERISA, including any determination that your HSA is subject to ERISA’s continuation
coverage requirements, this agreement may be amended or terminated at our sole discretion as of the effective date of
such determination or on such later date, as we deem appropriate.

We have no duty to determine whether your contributions or distributions comply with the Code, Treasury Regulations,
IRS Rulings or this agreement. In no event shall we be responsible to determine if contributions made by your employer
to your HSA meet the requirements for comparable contributions, the rules of which are set forth in the Code and IRS
published guidance.

We will maintain all confidential information in accordance with all applicable banking laws and regulations. Your HSA
established by this agreement, however, is not intended to be a “health plan” or other “covered entity” as defined by
regulations interpreting the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). We do not have access
to your personal health information and we expressly disclaim responsibility for the duties imposed upon covered entities
or their business associates under HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.

HSAs are personal health savings vehicles rather than group employee benefits. Although with respect to your HSA, your
employer may have agreed to forward contributions through its payroll system to your HSA Administrator for contribution
to your HSA, you are not restricted from moving funds to another HSA custodian or trustee (but your employer is not
required to forward payroll contributions to another HSA provider).

Some states and localities may have tax laws that are different from the federal laws for HSAs. You should consult with
your tax or legal advisor with questions about state and local laws that may affect your HSA.

11.25 Abandoned HSAs. Your HSA may be considered abandoned when there is no owner-generated activity
(including, but not limited to, deposits, withdrawals, letters, phone calls or address changes), for an extended period of
time. In the event that we determine that your HSA has been abandoned, we may close your account and issue a check
to your address on your HSA website account. Funds in abandoned HSAs may also be “escheated” (transferred) to the
state of your residence if your HSA is deemed abandoned under the rules applicable to your state of last known
residency. We will attempt to contact you before turning over funds to a state. Once the funds are transferred, you may be
able to recover the funds from the state. You agree that neither we nor your HSA Administrator are responsible for any
funds that are escheated to a state.

If your HSA balance is $25 or less for twelve (12) or more consecutive months (as determined by your HSA
Administrator) your HSA Administrator reserves the right to cancel your HSA debit card and close your HSA without
notifying you. If your account balance is zero and your employment with your employer has been terminated, your HSA
Administrator has the right to close your HSA immediately.

11.26   Disclosure Statement.

        a. Important Information about Procedures for Opening and Maintaining your HSA. To help the
        government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial
        organizations to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each individual who opens an account. What
        this means for you, when you open an HSA, you are required to provide your name, residential address, date of
        birth, and identification number. As part of the ongoing maintenance of your HSA we may require other
        information or documentation that allows us to identify you. You understand that your HSA may be closed if
        additional verification is not possible. Upon such closure, funds deposited in your HSA will be returned to you,
        less any fees or expenses chargeable against your HSA, or penalties or surrender charges associated with the
        early withdrawal of any savings instrument or other investment in your HSA. Neither we nor your HSA
        Administrator shall be liable for any tax consequences or tax withholdings you may incur as a result of the
        transfer or distribution of your assets.

        b. Force Majeure. We will be released without any liability on our part from the performance of our obligations
        hereunder, to the extent our performance is prevented by the event of Force Majeure. Force Majeure will mean
        any event or condition not reasonably within our control which prevents in whole or in material part, the
        performance by us of our obligations hereunder or which renders the performance of such obligations so difficult
        or costly as to make such performance commercially unreasonable.

        We shall not be liable for failure to perform or delay in performance of any of our obligations under this agreement
        to the extent that such failure or delay results from any act of God, including but not limited to a blizzard, flood,
        tornado or any other adverse weather conditions; military operation; terrorist attack; widespread and prolonged
        loss of use of the internet or the world wide web; national emergency; civil commotion; or the order of any
        government agency or acting government authority or any other cause beyond our reasonable control whether
        similar or dissimilar to the foregoing causes.

        c.  Healthcare Bank, a Division of Bell Bank Privacy Policy. By executing this agreement, you acknowledge
        receipt of our Privacy Policy. You agree to receive future notices of any updates to the Privacy Policy at
        www.healthcarebank.com or in this agreement which is available on your HSA website account and to review the

Important Information on Patriot Act Requirements

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law
requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who
opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name,
address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your
driver’s license or other identifying documents. Your identity may be verified through the use of a
database maintained by a third party. If your identity cannot be verified, you understand that you may be
required to provide additional information, and that your HSA may be closed if additional verification is not
possible. Upon such closure, funds deposited in your HSA will be returned to you, less any fees,
expenses or taxes chargeable against your HSA, or penalties or surrender charges associated with the
early withdrawal of any savings instrument or other investment in your HSA. We shall not be liable for any
tax consequences you may incur that result from the transfer of distribution of your assets as a result of
this distribution.
