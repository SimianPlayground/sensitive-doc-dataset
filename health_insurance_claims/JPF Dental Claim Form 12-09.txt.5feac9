The form is designed so that the Primary Payer’s name and address (Item 3) is visible in a standard #10 window envelope. Please fold the form
using the ‘tick-marks’ printed in the left and right margins. The upper-right blank space is provided for insertion of the third-party payer’s claim
or control number.
a)          All data elements are required unless noted to the contrary on the face of the form, or in the Data Element Specific Instructions that
          follow.
b)        When a name and address field is required, the full entity or individual name, address and zip code must be entered (i.e., Items 3, 11,

d)        If the number of procedures being reported exceeds the number of lines available on one claim form the remaining procedures must
          be listed on a separate, fully completed claim form. Both claim forms are submitted to the third-party payer.
