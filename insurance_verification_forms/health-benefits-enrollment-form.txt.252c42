                                HEALTH BENEFITS ENROLLMENT FORM

 ENROLLING IN A HEALTH & PRESCRIPTION PLAN
 There are two areas labeled “Health Insurance Plans” on page one, of the Health Benefits Enrollment Form.

 The first section is for employees who choose to participate in Plan Type 13 (employees who wish to
 participate in a Health Plan during their first 90 days of hire prior to being eligible for State Share) – meaning,
 they will be responsible for paying the entire amount of the health care premium.

 You will need to make a selection in each section for Plan Type 13 indicating:
  1. Your Benefit Effective Date (you must choose one): (1) Effective your Date of Hire (premiums are not
     pro-rated); (2) Effective the 1st Day of Month 1, following your date of hire; (3) Effective the 1st Day of
     Month 2, following your date of hire; or, (4) Effective the 1st Day of Month 3, following your date of
     hire.
  2. Your choice of one of the health plan options: Highmark Delaware First State Basic Plan, Aetna CDH Gold
     Plan, Aetna HMO Plan or Highmark Delaware Comprehensive PPO Plan along with the corresponding
     plan tier (Employee, Employee & Spouse, Employee & Child(ren), or Family),
  3. Or, if you chose not to participate in a Health plan at this time, you must select "Waive."

The second section is for employees who choose to participate in Plan Type 10 (for employees who wish to
participate in a Health Plan effective the first of the month after 90 days of employment, and are eligible
for State Share) – meaning, the state will then begin paying for a portion of their health plan premium.

You will need to make a selection in each section indicating:

1.    Your choice of one of the health plan options: Highmark Delaware First State Basic Plan, Aetna CDH
      Gold Plan, Aetna HMO Plan or Highmark Delaware Comprehensive PPO Plan;

3.    Or, if you chose not to participate in a Health plan at this time, you must select “Waive.”
If you chose the Aetna HMO Plan, you must also indicate on page two of the Health Benefits Enrollment
Form, the physician identification number which can be found by clicking on the Provider Directory
hyperlink. If you are choosing a Primary Care Provider (PCP) as part of your enrollment in this plan, make
sure you call them and confirm they are accepting new patients prior to enrolling. If you already have a
Primary Care Provider (PCP), make sure they participate in the Aetna HMO network prior to enrolling.

The State of Delaware offers prescription coverage as part of the State’s Group Health Insurance Plan
(GHIP). When you enroll in a health plan you will automatically be enrolled in the prescription drug plan
managed by Express Scripts.

ENROLLING IN A DENTAL PLAN
If you have chosen to participate in a Dental plan, you will first need to indicate:

      of the month following 90 days of employment.
 2.   Your choice of one of the dental plan options: Delta Dental PPO Plus Premier Plan or Dominion
      National HMO Select Dental Plan.
 3.   Then, you will need to choose which plan tier you are enrolling in, i.e., Employee, Employee & Spouse,
      Employee & Child(ren) or Family coverage.
 4.   Or, if you chose not to participate in a Dental Plan at this time, you must indicate this by selecting the
      "Waive" option.
 5.   If you chose the Dominion National HMO Select Dental Plan, you must also indicate on page two of
      the Health Benefits Enrollment Form the Primary Care Dentist/Provider ID which can be found on the
      Dominion National Provider Directory. If you are choosing a Primary Care Dentist as part of your
      enrollment in this plan, make sure you call them and confirm they are accepting new patients prior to
      enrolling. If you already have a Primary Care Dentist, make sure they participate in the Dominion
      National HMO Select Dental network prior to enrolling.

 important that you closely review this form to make sure it accurately reflects the benefit elections you
 submitted. Make sure that in addition to reviewing your benefit elections that you also review all related
 personal information entered for you and your covered dependents. Please note: The Confirmation form only
 reflects Health, Dental, and Vision elections. It does not reflect Additional Benefit elections.

 immediately to make the correction. If everything has been entered accurately, please sign and return the
 Confirmation Form to your agency’s HR/Ben Rep right away.
