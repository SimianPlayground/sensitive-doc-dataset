 AUTHORIZATION AGREEMENT
 I authorize New York University to make electronic deposits of payments indicated in section 1 above. This authority will remain in effect
 until I have given written notice of termination or until New York University has notified me that this service has been discontinued. In the
 event of changes to my information, I understand that I must give advance notice to allow reasonable time for my instructions to be
 executed. In the event that an incorrect amount should be entered into my account, I authorize my bank and New York University to make
 the appropriate adjustment. If you provide either avoided check or a bank statement verifying your ACH routing and account numbers,
 deposits will take effect with the payment processed. If no voided check or bank statement is provided, then after approximately two
 weeks a check will be issued. Once a voided check or bank statement is received, the direct deposit agreement will take effect.
