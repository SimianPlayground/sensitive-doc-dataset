       the Order (including, but not limited to, providing any goods and/or services hereunder), or
       acceptance of any payment under the Order, shall each constitute Seller’s unqualified and
       irrevocable acceptance of this Order subject solely to these terms and conditions. In the event
       that this Order does not state price or delivery terms, Buyer will not be bound to any prices or
       delivery terms to which it has not specifically agreed in writing. Any terms or conditions
       proposed by Seller inconsistent with or in addition to the terms and conditions contained in this
       Order shall be void and of no effect unless specifically agreed to in writing by Buyer’s Purchasing

      A. All goods and/or services provided by Seller under this Order shall be in accordance with the
      requirements of this Order, including all applicable exhibits and attachments, and shall be
      subject to rejection if such goods and/or services are nonconforming. No inspection or
      evaluation performed by Buyer (and/or Buyer’s customer, if applicable) shall in any way relieve
      Seller or its suppliers of their obligation to furnish all required goods and/or services in strict
      accordance with the requirements of this Order. If any of the goods and/or services provided
      hereunder do not conform with the requirements of this Order, Buyer may require Seller to

      authorization from Buyer.

      made by Buyer in writing. It is expressly agreed that payment by Buyer to Seller for goods
      and/or services provided under this Order shall not constitute acceptance. It is further agreed
      that nothing in this Order shall require Buyer to accept any goods and/or services prior to
      acceptance thereof by Buyer’s customer, if applicable.
      D. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, or gross mistakes amounting
      to fraud.

      A. Seller’s invoices or vouchers shall contain all certifications required by Buyer and shall
      include the invoice date, the Order number, as well as a complete breakout of the prices by line
      item for the goods and/or services encompassed by the invoice or voucher.
      B. Unless otherwise stated in the Order, the price for all goods and/or services provided by
      Seller is all-inclusive and encompasses any and all federal, state, local or foreign taxes and duties
      that may be applicable, and all installation, testing, debugging, warranty charges, any and all
      license or use fees, and any other cost of every kind and description associated with Seller’s
      work.
      C. Buyer shall pay Seller after receipt of Seller’s proper invoices or vouchers for goods and/or
      services delivered and accepted, less any deductions provided for in this Order. Unless
      otherwise agreed in writing and stated on the face of the Order, payment terms are net forty-
      five (45) days from (i) delivery of the goods or completion of the services, or (ii) receipt of
      invoice, whichever is later.
      D. If the Order is of a Labor Hour or Time-and-Materials (T&M) type, the Seller shall provide
      reconciliations of billed and paid amounts on a quarterly basis. This report shall be provided to
      the Buyer’s Purchasing Representative unless otherwise noted.
      E. If the Order is of a Labor Hour, T&M, or cost reimbursement type and contains labor
      category descriptions, each invoice shall contain the following certification signed by the Seller’s
      authorized representative:

                      “This is to certify to the best of my knowledge that the qualifications of the
                      individuals whose labor is being invoiced herein were performed during the
                      period stated and meet the minimum labor category qualifications stated in the
                      Order, including but not limited to any education or experience requirements,
                      for the specific labor category in which their respective hours are being billed.”


VI.   Shipping, Packing, and Marking




                                                                                                         4
     A. Except as otherwise provided on the face of this Order, transportation charges on goods sold
     f.o.b. shipping point must be prepaid and invoiced to Seller. Transportation charges on goods
     sold f.o.b. destination must be prepaid in all cases. No insurance or premium transportation
     costs will be allowed unless authorized in writing by Buyer’s Purchasing Representative. Risk of
     loss to goods ordered hereunder, regardless of cause, shall be Seller’s responsibility until the
     goods have been delivered in compliance with terms of transportation required by this Order. If
     Seller does not comply with the stated delivery schedule, Buyer may, in addition to any other
     rights which it may have at law or in equity, require delivery by the most expeditious way, and
     any charges resulting from the premium transportation shall be fully prepaid and absorbed by
     Seller. Title to all goods passes at Buyer’s dock unless otherwise specified in this Order.
     B. Seller shall pack, mark and ship all goods in accordance with the requirements of this Order
     and in compliance with all applicable transportation regulations and good commercial practice
     for protection against damage from weather and shipment, including any applicable federal,
     state and local laws and regulations for the packaging, labeling, transportation and shipping of
     hazardous materials. Seller shall secure the most advantageous transportation services and
     rates consistent therewith. No separate or additional charge shall be payable by Buyer for
     containers, crating, boxing, handling, storage or any other services unless specifically stated in
     this Order or otherwise agreed to by Buyer in writing. Seller shall mark each container with the
     number of this Order and shall enclose a packing slip with this Order number in an envelope
     attached to each container. Damage resulting from improper packing or shipping will be charged
     to Seller.
     C. Acceleration of delivery is not authorized unless specified in writing by the Buyer’s
     Purchasing Representative.
     D. Buyer reserves the right to refuse or return at Seller’s risk and expense any shipments made
     in excess of the quantities stipulated in the Order or received in advance of the required delivery
     schedule, or to keep the goods received in advance of the required delivery schedule and defer
     payment as if the delivery was made per the required delivery schedule.



VII. Non-US Origin Shipments
     The Order is issued with the expectation that Seller will ship any goods to Buyer from a location
     within the United States. Any shipments originating outside the customs territory of the United
     States will import under the terms of sale DDP Buyer facility Incoterms 2010. Seller shall
     communicate its customs clearance instructions to its international third-party supplier prior to
     arrival into the United States to avoid any delays in delivery to Buyer. Under no circumstances
     shall Buyer be listed as the importer of record (or consignee for shipments delivered via courier)
     on customs documents for any Orders shipped directly to Buyer from a foreign location and
     Seller expressly agrees to accept all liability associated with said customs entries for any such
     Orders.


VIII. Schedule


                                                                                                      5
      Seller shall strictly comply with the delivery or performance schedule specified in the Order. No
      acts of Buyer, including without limitation modifications of this Order or acceptance of late
      deliveries or performance, shall constitute a waiver of this provision. Seller shall immediately
      notify Buyer in writing of any actual or potential delay in the deliveries or performance of this
      Order and such notice shall include the actions being taken to overcome or minimize the delay
      and a revised schedule using the Seller’s best efforts; provided, however, that Buyer’s receipt of
      such notice shall not constitute a waiver of Buyer’s rights to timely deliveries and performance
      and remedies for any late deliveries or performance. Buyer reserves the right to cancel this
      Order without incurring any liability to Seller and without waiving any other remedies available
      if delivery or performance, as specified in the Order or on Buyer’s written shipping
      authorizations, is not affected.


IX.   Inspection
      Buyer (and Buyer’s customer, if applicable) through any authorized representatives, has the
      right at all reasonable times and places to inspect and test the goods and/or services being
      supplied under this Order, including those provided by Seller’s suppliers. Buyer assumes no
      contractual obligation to perform any inspection or test unless otherwise specifically set forth in
      the Order. Buyer’s failure to inspect or test any goods and/or services shall not relieve Seller
      from responsibility for any defective or nonconforming goods and/or services. If any inspection
      or evaluation is made by Buyer or its customer on the premises of Seller or any of Seller’s
      suppliers, Seller or its suppliers shall provide at no additional charge reasonable access to
      facilities and assistance for the safety and convenience of the personnel conducting any
      inspection or test.


X.    Warranty




                                                                                                        6
      A. Seller warrants to Buyer, its successors and assigns, that all goods provided hereunder shall
      be (i) merchantable, (ii) free from defects in material and workmanship, (iii) free from defects in
      design (unless the goods are provided in accordance with Buyer’s design specifications), (iv)
      suitable for the purposes intended, (v) in compliance with all applicable specifications, drawings,
      and performance requirements, and, for any software provided with the goods, (vi) free from
      any viruses, malicious codes, worm, time bomb, self-help code, or other software code or
      routine designed to damage, destroy or alter any software, hardware or data, disable any
      computer automatically, or permit any unauthorized access to any software or hardware; and
      that all services provided hereunder shall be (i) free from defects in workmanship, (ii) suitable
      for the purposes intended, (iii) performed in a professional and workmanlike manner, and (iv) in
      compliance with all applicable specifications, drawings, and performance requirements.
      B. If any nonconformity under this warranty appears within one (1) year after final acceptance
      of the goods and/or services, Seller shall, at Buyer’s option, either (i) promptly and diligently
      repair, replace or correct (by re-performance or otherwise) such nonconformity at no cost to
      Buyer (including any transportation costs associated therewith), or, for goods only, (ii) accept
      return of the goods for credit or refund. If any repair, replacement or correction is not made in a
      timely manner to Buyer’s satisfaction, then the Buyer may, at its election and in addition to any
      other remedies available to Buyer at law or in equity, correct or have corrected such
      nonconformity at Seller’s expense.



XI.   Counterfeit Electronic Parts




                                                                                                        7
       A. For purposes of this Article, the term “electronic part” means an integrated circuit, a discrete
       electronic component (including, but not limited to, a transistor, capacitor, resistor, or diode) or
       a circuit assembly and includes any embedded software or firmware. The term “counterfeit
       electronic part” means an unlawful or unauthorized reproduction, substitution, or alteration
       that has been knowingly mismarked, misidentified, or otherwise misrepresented to be an
       authentic, unmodified electronic part from the original manufacturer, or a source with the
       express written authority of the original manufacturer or current design activity, including an
       authorized aftermarket manufacturer. Unlawful or unauthorized substitution includes used
       electronic parts represented as new, or the false identification of grade, serial number, lot
       number, date code, or performance characteristics.
       B. Seller shall only purchase electronic parts to be delivered or incorporated in the goods to
       Buyer directly from the Original Component Manufacturer (OCM)/Original Equipment
       Manufacturer (OEM) or through an OCM/OEM authorized distribution chain. Seller shall not
       acquire any electronic parts from independent distributors or brokers without the Buyer’s prior
       written approval. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing with all relevant information if
       Seller becomes aware or suspects that it has furnished any counterfeit electronic parts under
       the Order. When requested by Buyer, the Seller shall provide all relevant OCM/OEM
       documentation that authenticates the traceability of the affected items to the applicable
       OCM/OEM.
       C. The Seller shall establish and maintain an acceptable counterfeit electronic part detection
       and avoidance system.
       D. This Article applies in addition to any quality provision, specification, statement of work or
       other provision included in or incorporated into this Order addressing the authenticity of the
       electronic part. To the extent any such provisions conflict with this Article, this Article prevails.
       E. If any counterfeit electronic part is delivered or incorporated in the goods under this Order,
       the Seller shall, at its expense, promptly replace such counterfeit electronic parts with electronic
       parts conforming to the requirements of this Order. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this
       Order, the Seller shall be liable for all costs relating to or associated with such counterfeit
       electronic parts including, without limitation, the Buyer’s costs of removing any counterfeit
       electronic parts, of installing replacement electronic parts and of any testing necessitated by the
       reinstallation of electronic parts after the counterfeit electronic parts have been replaced. The
       remedies contained in this Article are in addition to any remedies available to Buyer at law, in
       equity or under any other provision of this Order.
       F. Seller shall include this Article or an equivalent provision in any purchase orders or lower-tier
       subcontracts for the delivery of electronic parts that will be included in or incorporated in the
       goods provided to Buyer hereunder.



XII.   Conflict Minerals




                                                                                                          8
     A. Consistent with the U.S. public policy underlying the enactment of Section 1502 of the Dodd-
     Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), the Seller recognizes the
     significant risks associated with sourcing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (hereinafter the
     “Conflict Minerals”) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries (the
     “Conflict Region”).
     B. Seller shall not knowingly provide any goods containing Conflict Minerals from the Conflict
     Region.
     C. Seller shall adopt (or already have in place) policies and processes to (i) conduct a reasonable
     inquiry into the country of origin of any Conflict Minerals incorporated into any goods provided
     under the Order, (ii) conduct due diligence of its supply chain, as necessary, to determine if any
     Conflict Minerals from the Conflict Region are incorporated into any goods provided under the
     Order, and (iii) promptly notify Buyer if any Conflict Minerals from the Conflict Region are
     incorporated into any goods provided under the Order. The Seller shall fully cooperate (at no
     cost to Buyer) with any inquiries conducted by Buyer or its customers to ensure compliance with
     this Article including, but not limited to, completing any applicable disclosure forms or surveys.



XIII. Proprietary Information
     A. All specifications, information, data, drawings, software and other items furnished by Seller
     under the Order that are clearly marked with a restrictive or proprietary designation shall be
     handled by Buyer on a proprietary basis, but may be used and/or disclosed by Buyer solely for
     the purposes of Buyer’s contract with its customer. Seller agrees to promptly notify Buyer in
     writing of any pre-existing patents or any other similar form of protection which Seller may hold
     or know of which relates to the goods and/or services to be provided under this Order.
     B. If any pre-existing patents, inventions, copyrights, technology, designs, works of authorship,
     mask works, technical information, software, or other information or data of Seller (hereinafter
     “Seller’s Intellectual Property”) are used, included, or contained in the goods and/or services
     provided hereunder, Seller grants Buyer an irrevocable, transferable, non- exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free license to use Seller’s Intellectual Property with such goods and/or services.
     C. Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing to the contrary, all specifications, information,
     data, drawings, software and other items which are (i) supplied to Seller by Buyer or (ii)
     obtained or developed by Seller and paid for by Buyer under this Order, shall be the exclusive
     property of Buyer, shall be maintained by Seller as proprietary to Buyer, shall be used only for
     purposes of providing goods and/or services to Buyer pursuant to this Order, and shall not be
     disclosed to any third party without Buyer’s prior written consent. All such items supplied by
     Buyer shall be promptly returned to Buyer on request or upon completion or earlier termination
     of this Order.



XIV. Buyer Property



                                                                                                      9
     A. All information, such as specifications and designs, as well as all drawings, tools, jigs, dies,
     fixtures, materials, and other items supplied or paid for by Buyer (hereinafter the “Buyer’s
     Property”) shall be and remain the sole property of Buyer, and Buyer shall have the right to
     enter Seller’s premises on a non-interference basis and remove any such property and Seller’s
     records with respect thereto at any time without being liable for trespass or for damages of any
     sort.
     B. Unless the Buyer otherwise consents in writing, the Buyer’s Property shall be used only in the
     performance of this Order and Seller may not use the Buyer’s Property to provide any goods or
     services to any third party.
     C. Seller shall protect and maintain the Buyer’s Property in its possession or control and shall be
     responsible for all loss or damage thereto, except for normal wear and tear.



XV. Release of Information
     Seller shall not publish any information developed under this Order nor distribute it nor make
     any news release about the existence or subject matter of this Order without Buyer’s prior
     written consent.

                                                                                                      10
     A. Buyer shall have the right at any time to (i) suspend all or any portion of Seller’s work for a
     period up to ninety (90) Days, and/or (ii) make changes within the general scope of this Order
     that affect any one or more of the following:

              5.       amount of any Buyer-furnished or customer-furnished property or facilities.
     B. If any such suspension or change causes a change in the cost of, and/or the time required
     for, performance of this Order, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the price or delivery
     schedule or both, and this Order shall be modified in writing accordingly. Any claim by Seller for
     such an adjustment must be made in writing within twenty (20) Days from the date of receipt of
     a written order from Buyer’s Purchasing Representative directing such a suspension or change.
     C. Nothing in this clause, including any disagreement with Buyer as to any equitable
     adjustment, shall excuse Seller from proceeding with this Order as changed. Any disagreement
     between the parties arising out of this clause shall be resolved in accordance with the clause
     entitled “Disputes Under This Order.”

     the date of this Order.
     E. No constructive changes: Information, advice, approvals or instructions given by Buyer’s
     technical personnel or other representatives shall be deemed expressions of personal opinion
     only and shall not affect Buyer’s and Seller’s rights and obligations hereunder unless set forth in
     a writing which is signed by Buyer’s Purchasing Representative and which states that it
     constitutes an amendment or change to this Order.



XVII. Access To Records
     Buyer shall have access to all technical and quality records of Seller’s performance hereunder.


XVIII. Termination for Convenience




                                                                                                       11
      A. Buyer, by written notice, may terminate this Order at any time, in whole or in part, without
      cause and/or for Buyer’s convenience, prior to final delivery of goods and/or completion of
      services, and such termination shall not constitute a default. In such event, Buyer shall have all
      rights and obligations accruing both at law and in equity, including Buyer’s rights to title and
      possession of any goods paid for. Seller shall be reimbursed for any actual, reasonable,
      substantiated and allowable costs, plus a reasonable profit for work performed to date of
      termination. Buyer may take immediate possession of all work so performed upon notice of
      termination.

      Seller fails to (i) deliver the goods and/or perform the services within the time specified in this
      Order or any extension thereof granted by Buyer in writing, (ii) perform any of the other
      provisions or meet any of the requirements of this Order, or (iii) make progress so as to
      endanger performance of this Order in accordance with its terms and, in either of the second or
      third circumstances, does not cure such failure within ten (10) Days after receipt of written
      notice thereof from Buyer.
      B. If Buyer terminates this Order in whole or in part it may acquire, upon such terms as it deems
      appropriate, goods and/or services similar to those terminated. Seller shall be liable to Buyer for
      any excess cost for such similar goods and/or services, provided, however, that Seller shall
      continue performance of this Order to the extent not terminated hereunder and, provided
      further, that Buyer shall pay the price set forth in this Order for completed goods or services
      delivered and accepted.
      C. The rights and remedies of Buyer in this Article are in addition to any other rights and
      remedies provided by law or in equity, or under this Order.

      by any of its affiliated companies, to Seller.


XXI. Governing Law



                                                                                                      12
     This Order shall be enforced and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New
     York, without regard to the conflict of law rules thereof. This Order excludes the application of
     the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.


XXII. Disputes Under this Order
     The parties shall attempt to amicably resolve all disputes arising from or related to this Order. If
     the parties are unable to resolve such a dispute within a reasonable time, then the parties may
     agree upon alternate dispute resolution, or the dispute shall be adjudicated exclusively in a
     court of competent jurisdiction in the State where Buyer is located, applying the governing law
     as stated in Article 22. Pending resolution or settlement of any dispute hereunder, the Seller
     shall proceed diligently as directed by Buyer with the performance of this Order.


XXIII. Disputes Under a Government Prime Contract
     A. If the Contracting Officer of Buyer’s Government Prime Contract by a final decision interprets
     any provision or requirement of Buyer’s Prime Contract, and the same or substantially similar
     provision or requirement is contained in this Order, such interpretation shall be binding
     between Buyer and Seller, provided that Buyer affords Seller the opportunity to appeal such
     decision in Buyer’s name, and provided further that Seller provides to Buyer any and all
     information requested by Buyer to justify Buyer’s verifying, supporting, or providing any and all
     certifications required by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. § 601 et seq. Any such
     appeal brought by Seller shall be at the sole expense of Seller, who shall be solely responsible
     for the prosecution of such appeal. If Seller so appeals, Seller shall, upon Buyer’s written
     request, provide Buyer with advance copies of papers to be filed in such appeal and such other
     information, consultation, and opportunity to participate in the appeal as Buyer may request. As
     used in this provision, the term “appeal” shall include any and all proceedings taken by Seller
     under this provision before any board of contract appeals or federal courts.
     B. If Seller asserts a claim against Buyer for either damages or an equitable adjustment in a
     situation where the facts constituting such claim would also support a claim by Buyer against
     Buyer’s customer, prior to initiating any action or suit on such claim against Buyer in any court, if
     Buyer so authorizes, Seller shall pursue, to exhaustion of its administrative and judicial
     remedies, such claim in Buyer’s name and at Seller’s cost against Buyer’s customer.
     C. Any reference to the “Disputes” clause in any applicable FAR or DFARS clause incorporated
     into this Order shall mean this Article 24.



XXIV. Indemnification
     In addition to any other indemnification provision of this Order, Seller shall indemnify, defend
     and hold harmless Buyer, its officers, directors, and employees, from any and all claims,
     liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees --


                                                                                                        13
             1.       for actual or alleged (a) injury to any person, (b) damage to any property, or (c)
             violation of any law, ordinance, or regulation, arising from or related to Seller’s (or
             Seller’s subcontractors’) performance of work in connection with this Order; or
             2.       for any negligent, reckless or willful act or omission hereunder; or
             3.       for Seller’s breach of any warranty or representation hereunder; or
             4.       for any civil or criminal penalty or fine incurred by Buyer which is caused to any
             degree or any extent by Seller, its employees, agents, representatives, suppliers, or
             subcontractors.



XXV. Design Changes
     During performance of this Order, Seller shall not make any changes in the design of goods to be
     furnished by Seller under this Order without the Buyer’s prior written approval. This applies
     whether or not there is a cost impact associated with the change and regardless of the type of
     change involved, including product improvements.


XXVI. Export Control




                                                                                                      14
     A. Seller agrees to comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations of Seller’s country and of
     the United States pertaining to the export of any hardware, software, defense service,
     information or technical data provided by, through, or with the cooperation of the Buyer in the
     performance of this Order, whether in the United States or abroad. This Order may involve
     information or items that are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or
     Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and that may not be released to Foreign Persons inside
     or outside the United States without the proper export authority.
     B. The ITAR defines a “Foreign Person” as any person who is not a U.S. citizen, a lawful
     permanent resident as defined by 8 USC 1101(a)(20), or a protected individual as defined by 8
     USC 1324b(a)(3). Foreign Person is also defined as a corporation, a business, an association, a
     partnership, or any other entity that is not incorporated or organized to do business in the
     United States and as international organizations, foreign governments, and any agency or
     subdivision of foreign governments (e.g., diplomatic missions).
     C. Seller further agrees that it will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, any hardware,
     software, defense service, information or technical data provided by, through, or with the
     cooperation of the Buyer to any Foreign Person, including persons employed by or associated
     with, or under contract with the Seller or Seller’s lower-tier suppliers without the prior written
     consent of the Buyer and without first obtaining any required export license or other approval.
     D. In addition, should Seller participate in the performance of this Order at Buyer’s facilities,
     Seller shall inform Buyer in advance in writing of the country of citizenship (or countries, in the
     case of dual citizenship) of each Foreign Person employee, agent, or representative of Seller or
     of Seller’s suppliers prior to such person being allowed access to Buyer’s facilities. Seller's and
     Seller's suppliers' Foreign Person employees, agents, or representatives shall not participate in
     the performance of this Order at Buyer's facilities without Buyer's prior written consent.
     E. Seller shall comply with the registration requirements of the ITAR at 22 CFR §122.1, as
     applicable.
     F. Seller represents that neither Seller nor any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of Seller is included
     on any of the restricted party lists maintained by the U.S. Government. Seller shall promptly
     notify Buyer in writing if Seller is, or becomes, listed in any Restricted or Denied Parties List or if
     Seller’s export privileges are otherwise denied, suspended or revoked in whole or in part by any
     Governmental authority.
     G. Seller shall include paragraphs A through G or equivalent provisions in all lower tier
     subcontracts for any items that will be included in or delivered as goods to Buyer.
     H. Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless for all claims, demands, damages, costs, fines,
     penalties, attorneys’ fees and other expenses arising or resulting from Seller’s failure to comply
     with this clause.



XXVII.       Compliance with Laws
     Seller shall comply with the applicable provisions of all federal, state, and local laws and
     ordinances and all lawful orders, rules, and regulations thereunder, and such compliance shall
     be a material requirement of this Order. If the Buyer incurs any costs, damages or penalties as a


                                                                                                         15
     result of a violation of any applicable laws or regulations by Seller, its directors, officers,
     employees, agents, suppliers or subcontractors at any tier, Buyer may, in addition to any rights
     or remedies available at law or in equity, make a corresponding reduction of any amounts due
     under this Order or demand payment thereof from Seller.


XXVIII.   Equal Employment Opportunity; Notification of Employee
Rights Under Federal Labor Laws
     A. As applicable, the provisions of the Equal Opportunity Clauses pursuant to Section 202 of
     Executive Order 11246, as amended, and 41 CFR Section 60-1.40; as well as 29 CFR Part 471,
     Appendix A to Subpart A, are herein incorporated by reference. Further, if Seller (1) is not
     otherwise exempt as provided by 41 CFR 60-1.5, (2) has 50 or more employees, and (3) has a

     regulations set forth above.
     B. The Buyer and Seller shall abide by the requirements of 41 CFR §§ 60- 300.5(a) and
     60741.5(a). These regulations prohibit discrimination against qualified individuals on the basis of
     protected veteran status or disability, and require affirmative action by covered prime
     contractors and subcontractors to employ and advance in employment qualified protected
     veterans and individuals with disabilities.



XXIX. Duty to Proceed
     Except as expressly authorized in writing by Buyer, the failure of Buyer and Seller to reach
     agreement with respect to any dispute relating to or arising under this Order shall not excuse
     Seller from proceeding diligently with the performance of the work required by this Order.


XXX. Incorporation of Supplemental Terms and Conditions
     If this Order is placed under a Government Prime Contract, then the clauses set forth by citation
     in the Supplemental Terms and Conditions, attached as Supplement 1 and, if applicable,

      B. In the event of conflict between specifications, drawings, samples, designated type, part
      number, or catalog description, the specifications shall govern over drawings, drawings over
      samples (whether or not approved by Buyer), and samples over designated type, part number,
      or catalog description. In cases of ambiguity in the specifications, drawings, or other
      requirements of this Order, Seller shall, before proceeding, consult Buyer, whose written
      interpretation shall be final and binding on the parties.



XXXII.Assignment
      Seller shall not sell, assign, or in any manner transfer this Order or its rights, duties, and
      obligations under this Order without first obtaining the written consent of Buyer. Any attempted
      assignment without such consent shall be void. The foregoing shall not apply to an assignment

      liable, jointly and severally, to Buyer for all obligations arising under or resulting from this Order.

XXXV.        Force Majeure
     Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be liable for failure to perform under this Order if such failure is
     due to events which are beyond the reasonable control and without the fault or negligence of
     such party, and which intervene after the execution of this Order and impede its performance,
     provided such failure to perform shall only be excused for the duration of such intervening
     event and shall be subject to the Buyer’s right to terminate this Order pursuant to Article 19.

     reason of any of the said circumstances shall notify the other party in writing without delay on
     the intervention and cessation thereof.


XXXVI.       Waiver, Severability and Remedies

     A. The failure or delay of either party to insist on performance of any provision of this Order, or
     to exercise any right or remedy available hereunder, shall not be construed as a waiver of that
     provision, right, or remedy in any later instance. Further, if any provision of this Order is or
     becomes void or unenforceable by operation of law, the remaining provisions shall be valid and
     enforceable.
     B. Unless otherwise expressly stated herein, the rights and remedies of both parties hereunder
     shall be in addition to their rights and remedies available at law or in equity; provided, however,
     that in no event shall Buyer be liable to Seller for any anticipatory profits or for any special
     (including multiple or punitive), indirect, incidental, or consequential damages howsoever
     arising.



XXXVII.      Entire Agreement
     This Order, including any attachments and documents incorporated by reference, constitutes

     Order shall be binding upon either party unless it is set forth in a written instrument signed by

General Terms and Conditions of Purchase Supplement 1 – Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
Government Contract Provisions

Version August 2014
     I.       When the products or services furnished are for use in connection with a U.S. Government
              prime contract or subcontract, in addition to the DRS General Purchase Order Terms and
              Conditions, the following provisions shall apply, as required by the terms of the prime
              contract or by operation of law or regulation. The effective version of each Federal
              Acquisition Regulation (hereinafter “FAR”) provision shall be the same version as that which
              appears in Buyer’s prime contract (as amended) or higher tier subcontract (as amended)
              under which this Purchase Order is a subcontract. For the acquisition of commercial items
              under Purchase Orders placed in support of, and charged to, a U.S. Government prime
              contract or subcontract, the only FAR clauses that are required by FAR 52.244-6 are those
              annotated with * after the FAR provision number. For the definition of a commercial item
              see FAR 2.101.
     II.      In the event of a conflict between these FAR provisions and the General Terms and
              Conditions of Purchase, the FAR provisions shall control.
     III.     Seller shall insert these provisions in selected lower tier subcontracts, either verbatim or in
              substance, and by incorporation-by-reference or otherwise as appropriate.
     IV.      In all clauses listed herein, the terms “Government,” “Contracting Officer,” and “Contractor”
              shall be deemed revised to suitably identify the contracting parties herein and effect the
              proper intent of the provision except where further clarified or modified below. However,
              clauses identified by ** after the title shall have their original meaning as written in the FAR,
              and when identified by *** after the title shall not only have their original meaning as
              written in the FAR, but “Government,” “Contracting Officer,” and “Contractor” shall also
              mean Buyer. “Subcontractor,” however, shall mean “Seller’s Subcontractor” under the
              Purchase Order.
     V.       If any FAR clauses do not apply to a specific Purchase Order, such clauses are considered to
              be self-deleting.

prior certification, Seller must certify as to the accuracy, currency and completeness of its information in
accordance with the FAR required Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing data.

         A. Indemnification:
If any cost or price (including profit or fee) negotiated in connection with the prime contract between
the Government and Buyer or any cost that is reimbursable under said contract is reduced because cost
or pricing data furnished by the Seller in connection with any proposal submitted by Buyer relating to
said contract or in connection with this Purchase Order was not accurate, complete, or current, the
Seller shall indemnify Buyer in the amount of said reduction. The phrase “cost or pricing data” as used
herein shall be deemed to include any such data related to a lower-tier prospective or actual
subcontract, at any level, which was submitted by the Seller or which it procured by submission of or in
connection with the aforesaid proposal or this Purchase Order in support of its cost estimate.




If any reduction of the contract price under this clause reduces the price of items for which payment
was made prior to the date of the modification reflecting the price reduction, the Seller shall be liable
and shall pay Buyer at the time such overpayment is repaid:




                                                                                                            11
                1.      Simple interest on the amount of such overpayment to be computed from the
                date(s) of overpayment to the Seller to the date Buyer is repaid by the Seller at the
                applicable underpayment rate effective for each quarter prescribed by the Secretary of
                the Treasury under 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2); and
                2.      For Department of Defense contracts only, a penalty equal to the amount of the
                overpayment, if the Seller knowingly submitted cost or pricing data which were
                incomplete, inaccurate or non-current.


         B. Cost or Pricing Data for Changes
Prior to the pricing of any change or other modification to this Purchase Order which involves increases
and/or decreases in costs plus applicable profit expected to exceed the threshold for submission of cost
or pricing data, Seller shall submit cost or pricing data and shall certify that such data, as defined in
Federal Acquisition Regulation 2.101, submitted either actually or by specific identification in writing are
accurate, complete and current as of the date of completion of negotiations.

When required to obtain cost or pricing data from its subcontractors, pursuant to the provisions of this
Purchase Order, Seller shall obtain such data.




                                                                                                         12
General Terms and Conditions of Purchase Supplement 2 – Department of Defense FAR Supplement

            provisions shall apply, as required by the terms of the prime contract or by operation of law
            or regulation. The effective version of each Department of Defense FAR Supplement
            (hereinafter “DFARS”) provision shall be the same version as that which appears in Buyer’s
            prime contract (as amended) or higher tier subcontract (as amended) under which this
            Purchase Order is a subcontract. For the acquisition of commercial items under Purchase
            Orders placed in support of, and charged to, a U.S. Government Department of Defense
            prime contract or subcontract, the only DFARS clauses that are flowed down are those
            required by a particular DFARS provision to be flowed down, and those clauses are
            annotated with *. For the definition of a commercial item, see FAR 2.101.
    II.     In the event of a conflict between these DFARS provisions, or the Supplement 1 FAR
            provisions, and the General Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, the DFARS provisions
            shall control.
    III.    Seller shall insert these provisions in selected lower tier subcontracts, either verbatim or in
            substance, and by incorporation-by-reference or otherwise, as appropriate.
    IV.     In all clauses listed herein, the terms “Government,” “Contracting Officer” and “Contractor”
            shall be deemed revised to suitably identify the contracting parties herein and effect the
            proper intent of the provision except where further clarified or modified below.
            “Subcontractor,” however, shall mean “Seller’s Subcontractor” under the Purchase Order.
    V.      If any DFARS clauses do not apply to a specific Purchase Order, such clauses are considered
            self-deleting.

         require subcontractors provided Government property
         under the prime contract to comply with the

         subcontractor compliance shall be included in the
         contractor’s property control system. Where the
         property administrator assigned to the contract has
         requested supporting property administration from
         another contract administration office, the contractor

         property administrator instead of performing
         duplicative actions to assure the subcontractor’s
