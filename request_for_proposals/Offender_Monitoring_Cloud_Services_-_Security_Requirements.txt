below:

    1. Section I contains questions focused on the City and County of Denver, specifically to our
       environment and unique requirements.

    2. Section II evaluates the technical maturity of our vendors using industry standards when
       regulatory data will be included in the project. Regulatory data include HIPAA, CJI, PCI, PII, etc.

Completing Section I – Mandatory RFP Requirements
Regardless of the submission method used for Section II, all vendors must submit responses to the
questions in Section I. All questions in this section are mandatory and must be answered to complete
the RFP submission.

Service Provider RFP Technical Requirements


Section I – Mandatory RFP Requirements
If the cloud service being proposed does not meet the technical specifications provided in this section,
proposals may be submitted; however, a technology exception waiver must be applied for and granted
by the Technology Services Leadership Team as a term and condition of the contract. If future
compliance is planned (i.e., in a future release of the proposed software or system) please note that
clearly in the waiver and in the proposal.

1. Identity Management
1-CCD-01        Oracle Identity Management
The City’s Identity and Access Management (IdM) system is an integrated infrastructure solution that
enables many of the City’s services and online resources to operate more efficiently, effectively,
economically and securely. All new and proposed applications must utilize the authentication and
authorization functions and components of the IdM. Strong authentication is required for privileged
accounts or accounts with access to sensitive information. This technical requirement applies to all
solutions, regardless to where the application is hosted.

1-CCD-02 (re: IAM-12) User ID Credentials
Internal corporate or customer (tenant) user account credentials shall be restricted as per the
following, ensuring appropriate identity, entitlement, and access management and in accordance with
established policies and procedures:

   a) Identity trust verification and service-to-service application (API) and information processing
      interoperability (e.g., SSO and Federation)
   b) Account credential lifecycle management from instantiation through revocation
   c) Account credential and/or identity store minimization or re-use when feasible
   d) Adherence to industry acceptable and/or regulatory compliant authentication, authorization,
      and accounting (AAA) rules (e.g., strong/multi-factor, expireable, non-shared authentication
      secrets)

2. End-User Device Compatibility
2-CCD-01         City Client Device Compatibility
A city client device refers to the computing equipment used by City and County of Denver employees,
officers or personnel working on behalf of the City and County of Denver. At the present time, these
devices incorporate desktops, laptop and tablets. If the cloud service solution being proffered is highly
dependent or tightly coupled with hardware specifications or installed software (e.g., Java JRE version)
please consult with the City’s Purchasing office for the current deployed environment in the agency,
department, or area of interest.

Desktop, Workstation, and Laptop Hardware
The cloud solution being acquired must be compatible with the current desktop, laptop, or tablet
computing environment. The specifications are based on the City’s hardware lifecycle bid process and
represent the expected maximum hardware specification for that class of hardware. Currently, there
are two active bid cycles, 2007 and 2013. Both hardware bid cycles have been included to serve as
reference for current and future hardware environment state.

Bid                                                                  2007 - 2013               2013 – 2018+

3. Statement of Network Impact
3-CCD-01        Network Impact and Internet Traffic Shaping
The City’s network bandwidth is an expensive resource that is being shared among many City agencies
and departments, and some applications require guaranteed bandwidth and priority. The City utilizes
traffic shaping (i.e., bandwidth shaping or packet shaping) as a general network control to prioritize
and provide quality assurance to internet resources and guarantee certain bandwidth based on
predefined policy rules.

The City recognizes that the cloud service user experience depends on many factors and that to
quantify those factors is a difficult and arduous task. Therefore, the City has developed four (4) general
traffic shaping policies available for new cloud services:

    a)   500 kbps
    b)   1 Mbps
    c)   2 Mbps
    d)   4 Mbps
    e)   Technology Waiver Request for Additional Shaping Policy

Based upon the cloud service offered, business requirements listed, number of expected concurrent
clients, and other/additional knowledge of the service or services being offered within this RFP, choose
a traffic shaping policy that maintains the user experience and provide a statement of network impact
and justification that supports the policy requested, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
