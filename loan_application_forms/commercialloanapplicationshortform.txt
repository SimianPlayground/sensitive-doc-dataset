The purpose of collecting this information is to help ensure that all borrowers are treated fairly and that the housing needs of communities and
neighborhoods are being fulfilled. For residential mortgage lending, Federal law requires that we ask borrowers for their demographic information
(ethnicity, race, and sex) in order to monitor our compliance with equal credit opportunity, fair housing, and home mortgage disclosure laws. You are
not required to provide this information, but are encouraged to do so. You may select one or more designations for "Ethnicity" and one or more
designations for "Race". The law provides that we may not discriminate on the basis of this information, or on whether you choose to provide it.
However, if you choose not to provide the information and you have made this application in person, Federal regulations require us to note your
ethnicity, race and sex on the basis of visual observation or surname. The law also provides that we may not discriminate on the basis of age or
marital status information you provide in this application. If you do not wish to provide some or all of this information, please check below.
