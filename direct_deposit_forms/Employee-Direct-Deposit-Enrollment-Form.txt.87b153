To enroll in Full Service Direct Deposit, simply fill out this form and give to your payroll manager. Attach a voided check for each checking account – not a
deposit slip. If depositing to a savings account, ask your bank to give you the Routing/Transit Number for your account. It isn’t always the same as the number
of a savings deposit slip. Below is a sample check MICR line, detailing where the information necessary to complete this form can be found.
