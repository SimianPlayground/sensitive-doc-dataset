  I.          Introduction

  The City of Lockhart is soliciting proposals from qualified professional vendors to provide
  Information Technology managed services. The qualified vendor will enable the City to
  continue to improve information technology (IT) effectiveness, enhance its quality of services,
  minimize its support cost, and maximize return on investment in IT.


   The qualified vendor would provide necessary technical services, which would enable the
   City to:

   • Protect and secure its technology facilities
   • Ensure the efficient operation of its data processing networks and related computer
     systems in its defined user community
   • Enhance its quality of service for departments defined in the enclosed schedules
   • Minimize the spending and maximize the ROI for investment in technology

   The ideal vendor will resolve computer systems and network issues in accordance with
   standard and acceptable maintenance and support benchmarks. The successful vendor will
   be expected to organize HELP DESK service calls efficiently and to ensure that there is NO
   significant computer downtime during normal working hours, generally 7:30AM to 5:30PM,
   Monday through Friday, in addition to 24-hour operations for Public Safety. The vendor is
   expected to report on status of technology issues and communicate effectively with City
   departments.


  II.         Background Information


        The City of Lockhart does NOT have an IT Department and is currently using an outside
        vendor service to provide Information Technology Managed Services.

        There are 14 (includes host and vm’s) Microsoft Windows servers being utilized throughout
        the City’s departmental infrastructure. These servers use a variety of software and are both
        physical and virtual. They have various memory and hard drive sizing. The City e-mail is
        hosted on a local Exchange 2010 Server. The system connects to the internet via Fiber 20
        Mb provided by Spectrum. The City is using Veeam and Asigra backups, secure tide spam
        filter. The City has 4 firewalls (1) ASA-5510, (1) 5505, (1) 5516x and PIX.

        There are approximately 99 PC’s in the departmental areas to be covered under the
        service and support agreement with the successful vendor. These PC’s are located
        throughout multiple buildings within the City of Lockhart city limits. These PC’s are all Dell
        products, and all have been replaced recently by a City-wide upgrade. Windows 10
        Professional is the prevalent operating system used on the workstations. The City currently
        has an Office 365 tenant with 79 Office 365 Business licenses. The City deploys Symantec
        as its prevalent anti-virus software and uses various versions of Windows software.

      (a)     Compliance. Histories, Warranty, Fiduciary Duty, Discretionary
      Termination. The successful bidder [proponent] must demonstrate to the City’s
      satisfaction that bidder [proponent] has clean environmental, criminal, and other
      compliance histories with state, federal, and local agencies or authorities. By
      submission of a bid or proposal in response to this solicitation, bidder [proponent]
      Warrants to the City that he / she / it (in the case of a corporation or other legal entity),
      including advisors, executive and supervisory employees, agents and
      representatives, are in good stead with all regulatory authorities that may have
      interests in or jurisdiction over the work activity or service bid [proposed] by the
      Contractor. Regulatory interest or jurisdiction may go directly to the Contract activity in
      question, to potential consequences of the activity, or indirectly to any regulated matter
      that may reflect upon the Contractor’s competency and integrity. The City relies upon
      Contractor’s Warranty and shall treat the Contractor as having a special fiduciary
      duty to the City in this respect due to potential for environmental, third party, and
      other regulatory liabilities which may attend this Contract, including but not limited to
      regulatory criminal responsibility. Contractor acknowledges such fiduciary duty to the
      City, promising a high standard of performance and best efforts to protect the public
      interest against consequences of environmental mishap. Contractor warrants that no
      matters pertaining to violations, notices of violation, or notices of regulatory concern
      are now pending against Contractor or those persons (employees / affiliates) of concern
      mentioned above; and that no civil or criminal litigation, and no manner of
      enforcement activity, however preliminary, is pending against Contractor or those
      persons, regardless of category or class of violation or potential violation. If any such
      matters are pending, Contractor must reveal and explain those matters in writing at
      the time his / her / its bid [proposal] is tendered to the City. If any such matters have
      been resolved, during the last five (5) years, Contractor must similarly reveal and
      explain same to the City with the bid [proposal] submission. The City retains the
      right to determine, according to its discretion, whether or not a pending, unresolved,
      or resolved enforcement issue or criminal matter concerning Contractor, its
      operations, or employees / agents / representatives may impact the responsible
      status of Contractor, i.e., render the Contractor unqualified, or detract from
      Contractor’s competency standing. In reliance on Contractor’s Warranty, the City
      reserves to itself the right to terminate the Contract, without further obligation upon
      the City and without further recourse or remedy for the Contractor except that the City
      shall duly pay Contractor for work or services performed to date of termination,
      should the City determine, following award of the Contract that Contractor failed to
      reveal and explain to the City's satisfaction any such matters having regulatory or
      criminal import or implications.

      (b)     Criminal Histories. Pending and Resolved; Termination. Contractor must
      disclose and explain in writing any pending criminal matters associated with his / her
      / its business operation. This disclosure goes to Contractor’s person, and to all
      persons working for Contractor in a supervisory, advisory, executive, agency, or in
      any representative capacity or manner associated with Contractor’s business
      enterprise, which person(s) have any criminal enforcement action pending against him
      or her, regardless of class or category of alleged violation which may be pending,
      however preliminary, including investigation. And concerning resolved criminal
      matters,
      Contractor must make similar written disclosures and explanations for the same

      category of persons, which disclosures and explanations concern any criminal
      enforcement action that may have been resolved against such persons during the
      last five (5) years. Failure to make such disclosures and explanations, with the
      submission of the bidder’s [proponent’s] response to the City’s solicitation, shall be
      grounds for the City’s termination of the Contract, should such information come to
      the City’s attention after award of the contract; in which case, Contractor shall be
      without recourse and remedy, except for the City’s payment to Contractor for services or
      work performed up to date of termination.
       (c)    Voidable Contract. Contractor’s failure to abide by disclosure and
       explanation requirements, in (a) and (b), above, shall render the Contract
       voidable at the City’s discretion, with no compensation due Contractor, if
       concealed or undisclosed violations, or undisclosed or concealed investigations
       leading to formal criminal charges, are of such portent, in the City’s judgment, as to
       place the City in a position of regulatory or third party liability exposure, or shall
       pose or result in a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare. Any sums paid
       Contractor, in the event of a voided contract, shall be recoverable by the City, in
       addition to and cumulative of any other legal or equitable remedies the City may
       have. Contractor understands the City shall enjoy the termination and voidable
       contract remedies set forth in paragraph (b) and this paragraph (c) due to the
       fiduciary duty owing from Contractor to City and due to the City’s reliance on the
       Contractor’s Warranty of Regulatory Compliance and clean Criminal History.
