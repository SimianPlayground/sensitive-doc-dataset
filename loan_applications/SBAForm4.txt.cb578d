                                   STATEMENTS REQUIRED BY LAW AND EXECUTIVE ORDER

Federal executive agencies, including the Small Business Administration (SBA), are required to withhold or limit financial
assistance, to impose special conditions on approved loans, to provide special notices to applicants or borrowers and to
require special reports and data from borrowers in order to comply with legislation passed by the Congress and Executive
Orders issued by the President and by the provisions of various inter-agency agreements. SBA has issued regulations and
procedures that implement these laws and executive orders, and they are contained in Parts 112, 113, 116, and 117, Title
13, Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1, or Standard Operating Procedures.

Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552)
This law provides, with some exceptions, that SBA must supply information reflected in agency files and records to a
person requesting it. Information about approved loans that will be automatically released includes, among other things,
statistics on our loan programs (individual borrowers are not identified in the statistics) and other information such as the
names of the borrowers (and their officers, directors, stockholders or partners), the collateral pledged to secure the loan, the
amount of the loan, its purpose in general terms and the maturity. Proprietary data on a borrower would not routinely be
made available to third parties. All requests under this Act are to be addressed to the nearest SBA office and be identified
as a Freedom of Information request.

Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3401)
This is notice to you as required by the Right of Financial Privacy Act of 1978, of SBA's access rights to financial records
held by financial institutions that are or have been doing business with you or your business, including any financial
institutions participating in a loan or loan guarantee. The law provides that SBA shall have a right of access to your
financial records in connection with its consideration or administration of assistance to you in the form of a Government loan
or loan guaranty agreement. SBA is required to provide a certificate of its compliance with the Act to a financial institution
in connection with its first request for access to your financial records, after which no further certification is required for
subsequent accesses. The law also provides that SBA's access rights continue for the term of any approved loan or loan
guaranty agreement. No further notice to you of SBA's access rights is required during the term of any such agreement.


The law also authorizes SBA to transfer to another Government authority any financial records included in an application for
a loan, or concerning an approved loan or loan guarantee, as necessary to process, service or foreclose on a loan or loan
guarantee or to collect on a defaulted loan or loan guarantee. No other transfer of your financial records to another
Government authority will be permitted by SBA except as required or permitted by law.

Flood Disaster Protection Act (42 U.S.C. 4011)
Regulations have been issued by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) and by SBA implementing this Act and its
amendments. These regulations prohibit SBA from making certain loans in an FIA designated floodplain unless Federal
flood insurance is purchased as a condition of the loan. Failure to maintain the required level of flood insurance makes the
applicant ineligible for any future financial assistance from SBA under any program, including disaster assistance.

Executive Orders -- Floodplain Management and Wetland Protection (42 F.R. 26951 and 42 F.R. 26961)
The SBA discourages any settlement in or development of a floodplain or a wetland. This statement is to notify all SBA
loan applicants that such actions are hazardous to both life and property and should be avoided. The additional cost of
flood preventive construction must be considered in addition to the possible loss of all assets and investments in future
floods.

Occupational Safety and Health Act (15 U.S.C. 651 et seq.)
This legislation authorizes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the Department of Labor to require
businesses to modify facilities and procedures to protect employees or pay penalty fees. In some instances the business
can be forced to cease operations or be prevented from starting operations in a new facility. Therefore, in some instances
SBA may require additional information from an applicant to determine whether the business will be in compliance with
OSHA regulations and allowed to operate its facility after the loan is approved and disbursed.
Signing this form as borrower is a certification that the OSA requirements that apply to the borrower's business have been
determined and the borrower to the best of its knowledge is in compliance.

Civil Rights Legislation
All businesses receiving SBA financial assistance must agree not to discriminate in any business practice, including
employment practices and services to the public, on the basis of categories cited in 13 C.F.R., Parts 112, 113, and 117 of
SBA Regulations. This includes making their goods and services available to handicapped clients or customers. All
business borrowers will be required to display the "Equal Employment Opportunity Poster" prescribed by SBA.
Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691)
The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of
race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a
binding contract); because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, or because the
applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The Federal agency that
administers compliance with this law concerning this creditor is the Federal Trade Commission, Equal Credit Opportunity,
Washington, D.C. 20580.

Executive Order 11738 -- Environmental Protection (38 C.F.R. 25161)
The Executive Order charges SBA with administering its loan programs in a manner that will result in effective enforcement
of the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Act and other environmental protection legislation. SBA must, therefore,
impose conditions on some loans. By acknowledging receipt of this form and presenting the application, the principals of
all small businesses borrowing $100,000 or more in direct funds stipulate to the following:

        1.   That any facility used, or to be used, by the subject firm is not cited on the EPA list of Violating Facilities.

        2.   That subject firm will comply with all the requirements of Section 114 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7414)
             and Section 308 of the Water Act (33 U.S.C 1318) relating to inspection, monitoring, entry, reports and
             information, as well as all other requirements specified in Section 114 and Section 308 of the respective
             Acts, and all regulations and guidelines issued thereunder.

        3.   That subject firm will notify SBA of the receipt of any communication from the Director of the Environmental
             Protection Agency indicating that a facility utilized, or to be utilized, by subject firm is under consideration
             to be listed on the EPA List of Violating Facilities.

Debt Collection Act of 1982 Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq. and other titles)
These laws require SBA to aggressively collect any loan payments which become delinquent. SBA must obtain your
taxpayer identification number when you apply for a loan. If you receive a loan, and do not make payments as they come
due, SBA may take one or more of the following actions:

             -   Report the status of your loan(s) to credit bureaus
             -   Hire a collection agency to collect your loan
             -   Offset your income tax refund or other amounts due to you from the Federal Government
             -   Suspend or debar you or your company from doing business with the Federal Government
             -   Refer your loan to the Department of Justice or other attorneys for litigation
             -   Foreclose on collateral or take other action permitted in the loan instruments.

Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-603)
If you are an alien who was in this country illegally since before January 1, 1982, you may have been granted lawful
temporary resident status by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service pursuant to the Immigration Reform
and Control Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-603). For five years from the date you are granted such status, you are not eligible for
financial assistance from the SBA in the form of a loan or guaranty under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act unless you
are disabled or a Cuban or Haitian entrant. When you sign this document, you are making the certification that the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 does not apply to you, or if it does apply, more than five years have elapsed
since you have been granted lawful temporary resident status pursuant to such 1986 legislation.

Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821 et seq.)
Borrowers using SBA funds for the construction or rehabilitation of a residential structure are prohibited from using
lead-based paint (as defined in SBA regulations) on all interior surfaces, whether accessible or not, and exterior surfaces,
such as stairs, decks, porches, railings, windows and doors, which are readily accessible to children under 7 years of age.
A "residential structure" is any home, apartment, hotel, motel, orphanage, boarding school, dormitory, day care center,
extended care facility, college or other school housing, hospital, group practice or community facility and all other
residential or institutional structures where persons reside.
